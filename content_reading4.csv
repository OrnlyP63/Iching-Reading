1,"Hi,I'm new on here. My husband and I are hoping to sell our house and move. I asked The IC if we could do this in 6 months and I got Hexagram 34 lines 1 and 5 changing to 28. Previously I asked the IC if we would move within the year and I got hex 1.5 changing to 14. I have gotten 14 quite a bit in relation to this issue. It seems 34 suggests timing is an issue (it is for us in terms of $ and the market) or does hex 28 indicate that things will get unbearable and thus we will move in 6 months? WE certainly are chomping at the bit to get out of here, but alas the housing market....Thank you for any insights!"
2,"I recently did a relationship reading asking the oracle how I should proceed with someone I've been seeing for about a month. I received Hex 23 with changing lines into 57. This is significant on several fronts. I meditated about the themes for me over the next several weeks and transition came up loud and clear, as did foundation and a pivotal turning point. I'm thinking these are all related, I'm just not sure how they tie together with this particular person, although I""m noticing some of my insecurities coming to the forefront and I don't like it. I dont want to repeat my patterns of the past. Any insight into this reading would be greatly appreciated. "
3,"Hi,I actually put the full story in another thread (true love in a traditional culture), but I realized that others would not be able to search and find the insight and wisdom and replies of others....so please forgive the duplication, but i know that as i have been learning, i find it so much more helpful to actually be able to search via the header of the threads!So if you do have a reply to this one....this is about receiving the blessings of the mother of the man that I am interested for our marriage.  She has been fighting our union. (like I said, full story is in the other thread)....Will his mother give her blessings to him for us?Hexagram 62.3>16"
4,"Good morning,The hearing for the dispute about child support from my exhusband is due to take place on the 23rd of this month.I asked Show me a picture of receiving a lump sum from child supportHex 56.3.4>23I was hoping to receive this money to register my kombi campervan thereby not only be able to go take a much needed break but also to give my other car to my son, who I am teaching to drive, when he gains his licence as well as easing up the financial strain we are in.My exhusband has been travelling with his fiance(older by 3 years though) - and he has told the child support agency she is supporting him financially (which she essentially is more or less) but he doesn't feel it is right that she should have to pay the child support payments just because he doesn't have the money.So there are vehicles and travelling involved in this reading so I am not quite sure what to make of it.thksMeilssa x"
5,"Hi all,I got the hexagram 10 (with 9 in the second place) to the following question: What will happen if I marry X?I can't figure out whether it tells me to go ahead or not....Can someone shed light on this please?Thank you,Igraine"
6,"We have a rather difficult relationship... On and off... Now he's here, ""in"" the relationship, then he acts as he was out... I don't understand and it's difficult to have a discussion with him about this, so I asked YI:What's his position in the relationship with me?Answer: 37.2.6 > 5Waiting for a family?  I don't understand the answer, seriously. I need help. Thank you."
7,"I have asked the oracle a series of questions re: somebody who I cannot get out of my head!If anybody could please help me to interpret these, I would be very grateful. I am quite new to the I Ching.The questions and answers were as follows:1) How can I let X know that she can have me if she wants me without coming on too strong and scaring her off?Answer: 44 no changing lines2) How realistic is it for me to believe that X & I could fall truly in love with each other?Answer: 64 no changing lines3) How realistic is my ambition to one day marry X?Answer: 22 no changing lines4) How should I respond at this time to my feelings for X in order to move with the Tao?Answer: 39.3 to 8I do have some ideas about what I think these mean, but I would be very interested to know what anybody else thinks without sharing my views, because I really don't have much confidence in my interpretations.Any help would be appreciated.Many thanks"
8,Will I ever be as successful as my brothers? Hexagram 63.1 to 39I guess 63.1 is like I can try (already tried to cross but got tail wet) but won't get far and 39 is obstruction so there are obstacles that stand in my path of achieving such success possibly not my fate.
9,"hello again, thank for being always there helping and giving advice.I have met a new man 3 weeks ago.He was very direct to me and first night we met, he kissed me very passionately when I left the pub.We go on seeing each other every saturday night, he asked my telephone number and I didn't give it to him because I'm not sure if he's convenient to me.I asked to the IC what does X think about me?the answer was 32 line 5>28I interpret that he thinks I'm a traditional woman because he wanted me to go to his home and make love and I regret and IC is telling me I must be this way, but what line must he follow in his behaviour with me?Thank you so much"
10,"Hello,I came across this website surfing. Looks like a great community of helpful, knowledgeable people!I have used the tarot cards for years on and off and only recently discovered the Iching in the last few weeks. I am quite fascinated by it but I am too new to the Iching to intrpret properly so I found this site and read some threads in the Shared Readings section and I hope some of you can help me interpret my readings. I would be very grateful.I am very new to the Iching so I need some simple to understand replies. I am not the expert on it by any means unlike many folks here. This is all new to me.Short version:I met a wonderful man  a few months ago and we clicked instantly. We have everything in common and the attraction between us is out of this world.Well a few weeks ago some things were said and he broke it off. He didn't want to, and, he actually emailed me a few times after the little spat we had, that he is in turmoil and does not know what to do right now.There is a problem going on ( not another woman and nothing to do with me)I miss him terrribly and I am hoping we will reunite.So I asked the IChing:Is X beginning to regret breaking up with me?Hex 12:5 to 35Will X come to  see me?Hex 39:4 to Hex 31Will X take action to contact me soon?Hex 54: 2,4 to Hex 24Where is my relationship with X heading?Hex 38:1 to Hex 64When will X contact me?Hex 39: 1,3,5 to Hex 24Will X open up to me again soon? Hex 18: 2,4,5,6 to Hex 31 Thanks in advance for your help and insights!Olita"
11,"Hi,There is a woman who is known to be both me and the man I am in love with, K. K and he are long-time friends. She and I became friends much later. She introduced me to him. Despite the fact that she was engaged at the time, she got very upset when she found out about us.K and he are both from the same community/caste (I am from an entirely different country/background). They have many ties. Last year, he and I had a break but we were getting back together. My gut tells me that she got in the middle back then to create trouble. He and I are now again in contact. Recently, she called a few friends of mine to tell them that I was stalking my guy (neither of those people even know who he is to begin with, but these are the only two people she knows well enough to call at all). At this point, I haven't mentioned what has happened because I do not want to upset him any more than I have to, but also because she has a friendship with his brother (who may be the actual instigator). I just don't want to create any further difficulties with my guy.I asked the Yi, should I tell him that he shouldn't trust her/ and tell him about these phone calls to my friends telling them I am stalking him? I received:16.2>40I also asked, how will he take this information:37.3>42Does this mean he takes her as family?Is it in our overall best interest for me to tell him about her:hexagram 40What will be any unforeseen consequences to me telling him?hexagram 19Because of my rather tenuous position with him at this moment, I am very interested in getting the interpretation right as I am still learning.By the way:I realized after sending this, I needed to make a few things clear:1) I am not stalking him! This is a maneuver to get me to stay away from him because he does want to be with me. 2) I know this issue seems like junior high, but love marriages or out of caste marriages are very unusual in this particular community and are highly discouraged by families.Thank you,modest learnerLast edited: Apr 2, 2011"
12,I know this might be a little ridiculous lol but I seem to have lost a rather expensive article of clothing. I suspect it's still around the house some where but I've scowered the place up and down and still can't find it.I asked the I-Ching where it was and got 27.1.6 changing to 2. Any idea where I might find it haha?
13,"Hello:bows:First to say how accurate YI has proven itself to be yet again-yestarday. I was asking about something and thought to ask about this guy who is coming on very strongly -hex 38.. I was surprised, thought it may be an echo of previous question asking....latter that night, 38 happened.This man came out of nowhere, saying how much he likes me, and getting all upset to my defences-it is a big surprise, and I don`t really have the will to jump into something just because he is pushing me.It is through the net, and I had bad experiances before, so I asked YI for an advice on how to act in this situation? hex 35.6 into 16Went through Shared Readings ""On the other hand, perseverance in such over energetic behavior, especially toward persons with whom there is no close connection, will lead to humiliation."" (Wilheim) His?""Be on the alert, it might be nothing – or it might really be the big bounty.""

14,"Am watching a zillion thoughts a day go through this head about a man who is no good for me ( and who lives just down the road and passes me daily ).  After much deliberation I told him that it wasn't a good idea to continue this because we weren't really fulfilling eachother's other needs at all.  On the contrary really.This man and I are as different as any two people can be different and there were lots of values and standards which we don't share at all.  But the connection was physical in a way I've not known for a long time.. and delicious !I've acknowledged I don't want to be with him,  I don't like being with someone who has such a different set of standards.  I don't like a lot of things about the r/ship;  he actaully bores me when we talk about things. OH LAWD ! I know he's not good for me .. I know I can't be this close to someone on just a physical level but I keep thinking of him.  It's been a couple of weeks now. Every day ! My thoughts are about whether or not I'll see him again, whether he still wants  me..what should I wear that he'll like? Really it's quite tragic.I've meditated and watched the thoughts dispassionately and prayed and let go the thoughts and surrendered them and done the whole thing....but they still keep coming and I feel like someone with a strange compulsive obsessive disease. Anyway..so I asked for support in getting him OUT of my head utterly and I got 47, lines 2 and 5. Not sure who these blokes are with knee bands..lol. Anyone got any ideas how I should take this hexagram? And anyone have similar experiences?  I'm not in love with the man and never was. But it seems like I might as well have been by the amount of space he takes up in my mind every day. I so want to let  him go. Thank you for reading "
15,"Hi,I'm new to I Ching (and this site), and I was hoping to get some help interpreting a reading. I asked if I should go to an event tomorrow night, and I got hexagram 48 changing to 45 at lines 2, 3, and 4. Here's some background: I'd very much like to attend the event, but I already made plans to attend an ex-boyfriend's birthday party. We've been broken up for three years and are still friends, even though we aren't a regular part of each other's lives, which I have no interest in changing. He would be disappointed if I didn't attend. The other event tomorrow night, the one I'd really to go to, will be filled with people that I might like to get to know better. I know quite a few people that will be attending, but they're acquaintances rather than friends. Several are older, and present professional opportunities. Some are younger, and present romantic and social opportunities. But I don't have anyone to bring along, and since I don't know any of them extremely well, I'm nervous about going and don't know if attending tomorrow night will be to my benefit or to my detriment. The second line seems to caution me against going, because the event probably will exacerbate my faults. Or it urges me to be aware of my flaws if I do attend. The third line seems to encourage me to go. I feel like it would be braver to go, and I want to be confident enough to take risks and do things that might make me uncomfortable (in measure) in order to grow.The fourth line seems to urge me to wait as I grow stronger internally, and that I'll be prepared when a similar opportunity presents itself next time.Any thoughts on that reading?Thanks for your help!-N"
16,"Hi All,Could someone help me interpret the following hexagrams for me please?Some context.  X and I met and dated for about 3 months. Most loving and emotionally intimate relationship, even discussed marriage. Some stuff about X1. X had been hurt and betrayed by his ex and had lots of fears constantly keeping tabs on me and being posessive.2. X is extremely family oriented and crazy about his Mum, even cut short our first date to go home and cook for her and always put his family first over himself and our relationship. Cancelled many dates to attend to his family responsibilities.But still X was devoted, attentive and caring until the time when X disappeared without any contact on two occassions and then phone calls started declining but once resurfaced and told me he didn't want to break up with me and wanted to salvage things. Then I went home for Xmas and he wrote to me to come back quick. I come back and he cut off all contact with me, changed his phone number and vanished without any explanation leaving me emotionally devastated. I made several unsuccessful attempts to contact him and finally wrote him an email about what I thought of his cowardly actions and broke off. After months of weeping, I started moving on but felt I needed to seek answers. He still checks up on me and that confuses me because he makes no attempt to make contact or get back with me.Ive been writing emails to him lately about how Ive moved on but how much he hurt me and also the emotional feelings of our time together. So I asked iching:1.What will be the outcome of my  communication and is there any chance if X will talk and give me the answers I am seeking?Hexagram 5 unchanging2. Can I expect to happen anything at all between me and X in future and Is X still the ONE for me?Hexagram 24 unchanging3. Why did he leave me?Hexagram 57>44Ive been a former iching sceptic and always believed people in a relationship should talk to each other than consult iching. But ironically X has vanished and I can't have a one-sided chat. Im now humbled and seek iching for guidance. I seek interpretation to my readings. Pls help me understand."
17,"After recent events have contributed to further confuse things with a certain 'friend' of mine, I  thought of asking the iching what are the chances of this relationship ever developing into something romantic and got 32 changing to 16.I've had 32 with conflicting lines before, but these two puzzle me. As for hex 16, I'm not really an expert on it so i'd like to ask if anybody could contribute any thoughts!thanks a lot!"
18,So I asked how this guy I'm dating feels about me and got hexagram 31.2.4.6 to 57.Then I asked if he's in love with me and got hexagram 14 unchanging!What do you guys think? It's getting rather serious and I don't want my heart broken again...
19,"Hi everybody,I asked the I Ching if my recent friendship with someone I met a month ago has potential to become a love relationship. I got hexagram 31, changing lines 3 and 5. Future: Hexagram 16.I'll appreciate all of your insights!"
20,"Hello, I'm new here. Not sure if I'm doing it correctly. I just wanted to know what people can tell me about how they'd interpret 44 lines 2 and 3. My question was in reference to a potential boyfriend. I'd appreciate any advice. I can't find the interpetations for the lines anywhere. Thank you. Chloe."
21,"Good afternoon,A financial situation that keeps going around and around in circles has again cropped up - it's basically someone trying to make me responsible financially for a debt that is not mine.On top of that my bank account got compromised by an overseas charity organisation, who somehow managed to withdraw funds of mine without my permission.The bank has been notified and are dealing with it accordingly.I gave my landlord the rent and it got stolen out of his wallet which he left openly sitting in his unlocked car.In his anger he almost blamed me for him having cash in his wallet where usually he just shops electronically, like most people I guess.I have always paid him cash and he hasn't asked me to do otherwise.Just when I seem to be getting on top of things financially something seemingly crops up to stop that from happening.My question is what am I meant to be learning in regards to my present financial issueHex 45.3.5.6>56thku - personally I have no idea what this meansI then asked how can I become financially abundant   Hex 38.4.6>19Melissa"
22,"Hi all,I have been in a very long struggle to be with a man that I have loved for several years. We have been apart for over a year and a half because, though he is modern, his family is from a traditional culture in which many marriages are still arranged. I know he loves me, but we have not been able to communicate very much at all because he had gotten into an engagement at the pressure of his family which he subsequently broke.I am getting near the end of what I can handle, and I don't know what is happening yet. So, today I cast to the Yi hoping for some insight. I have been through so much (he as well) that I think that it is difficult for either of us to believe that there may be an end in sight, since only his mother is the obstacle for us coming together formally.  When I cast, I asked ""how does (he) feel about us?""I got this: Hexagram 1, 1.2.4>53I really didn't understand the 4th line particularly.  Does it mean he is wavering??? I know that his mother is still trying to get him to meet other girls (call it a gut feeling or based on experience) I am just so worn out from the situation, it is so hard to take anything positively )--though I am willing!)... I know he is not going to want to move without her blessings...Will his mother give her blessings to him for us?Hexagram 62.3>16Can you help?Thanks so much .... modest learner"
23,"Question: What do I need to consider regarding going into business with my friend in order to make this decision?I got Hexagram 14 (Great Possession) Changing Line: 9 in the fourth place Becoming Hexagram 26 (Big Livestock) I'm thinking this bodes well for us, but says we need to do our due diligence. Consider how much this is really going to cost, research other businesses like it...What do you think?"
24,Hello Iching community. I had a few questions for the I ching tonight regarding the same matter. This is a complicated situation and involves unrequited love in a way. A2 years ago when I was 16years old I met a guy a few years older than me from a friend weonly spoke over the phone emailed etc for about 2 months until we planned to meet in person. He was a match for me in almost every way or so I thought we ended up meeti.g and did not hit it off. I ended up drinking a bit to much and giving off a bad first impression. Things did not go as we had both expected and although we were attracted to eachother he felt like I was still young and had a lot to learn he ended things with me shortly after.  I kind of blocked out the experiance since it was so short lived but I continued to think about him sometimes very intensely. And in my heart I feel as if we met at the wrong time and since I've learned a lot and a lot of time had passed I decided to contact him he read the message about 4 days ago but has not replied which has given me the impression that he doesn't have any interest in speaking to me again but that didn't feel like the truth so I cast 3 questions for the I ching. What is the reason he hasn't answered my message I got hexagram 54 unchanging. Next I asked if there was anything I could do to get an answer from him if I should give up or pursue it once more I got hex 27. Last I asked if there would be any future contact between the 2 of us and what would I manifest if I kept on basicly more about what he might do in the future thinking maybe one day he might think about it and reply or maybe he is in the process of considering it. I got 51 turning to 30. And that last answer struck me the most I felt it the most in my heart. I would be very grateful to receive an interpretation or any type of advice. On the situation it is very close to my heart I've even been dreaming about him. Is this the end should I move on or perservere and stay on the path. Please help me ion any way possible and thankyou so much
25,"hi all,wonder if you could shed some light regarding the follow readings. its of vital importance to do some body workout for the next two months.  The alternatives I have is gym and swimming pool so I asked Yi to have an idea of which is the best choice.a. what if i choose Gym : 60.1.3 >48at a first glance is not a ""yeah! go for it"" answer . On th other hand, in a way also describes the resistance factor of gym equipment and also warns for setting correctly an appropriate work out program because going beyond those limits , only harm will be the result.  Both hex have water, but in 60 is limited and in 48 its usable or feasible under certain circumstances or when the necessary means are available ( a long rope or a good bucket) b. what if i choose Swimming pool : 14.1.3.4 >4 line 1 sound good because swimming is more safe than gum. Line 4 makes also sense because it describes , in the context of the question, a more centered approach. I fail to grasp line 3 and its meaning in this reading though. As for hex 4, I see it as highlighting the need for an instructor a one to one sessions. What I found also interesting in hex 4, is that some specific muscles are in a h4 state and perhaps, although not very satisfied with my interpretation, line  3 could talk about the assistance the stronger one could provide to the weaker one. my gut feeling says that swimming  pool alternative is better and by  research i have read is highly recommended but I have to admit that I'm pretty biased against gym, lol , so I wonder if i miss something here .Any idea, comment, interpretation will be appreciated.thanks in advance"

28,"Just a lovely follow up to all that's going on..I was sitting down with a friend just now and we were going over the ins and outs of all the last few weeks - and I was shaking my head in exasperation of it all really... then out of the blue her dog came in, walked right on over and delivered a neat pile of horse poo onto our laps that he was carrying - one each!!quite a lovely message... yup, **** happens, get on and get up!

29,"Hello, gradually sorting my life out - in slow steps.  One thing that has now come up for attention is a buy to let property that my husband and I bought 18 months ago which I could either sell now or let out.  It has never been rented out before as the company that sold it to us rented it out as a showhome.  In beginning of June their lease runs out.  I did not want to get involved in this as I had a great fear of not being able to pay the mortgage and for some reason have always had huge anxiety about owning and dealing with property.  My knee jerk reaction was/is to sell the house so that I would have the money to reinvest in a property that I would actually want to live in - this is in a town that I have no wish to go back to now - long story.  I asked both:what can I expect from selling the house? (its on the market but hasn't got any interest yet even at a reduced price) and got hexagram 3: 3/6 - 37 and what can i expect from letting it & not selling ? and got 16:1/6 - 21.From what i can gather the letting would be the most favourable choice - but the relating hexagram of 37 is all about what I am most desiring right now - so maybe selling it and buying would be the best thing.  Am almost in a spin with so many things to think about, but its urgent because the agents have said its quite hard to sell once you have tenants in.  and as its a showhome its in good nic.  But I can't afford to have it empty just to sell it.  From those moving lines, could anyone put their opinions in?  thanks hebe."
30,"Hello everyone!For the past few weeks I've been through my usual ""crisis of faith"". I had posted in a previous thread about my trust issues and I've been working really hard on overcoming them. I actually thought I was doing really well until all of a sudden, without any real reason I found myself  thinking, doubting, questioning all over again. Whenever i get like this, I tend to project all my fears and anxieties onto my relationship. So once again my boyfriend is the unlucky victim of my ""paranoia"".I don't actually make any major scenes, but i become distant or even offensive and i do my best to push him away. As far as he is concerned, he has never done anything to make me feel this way and most of the time he is supportive and wants to talk it through, help me find out what's causing all this anxiety.. So today I had some quiet time and decided to have a conversation with the Yi. Some of it is clear to me but I would appreciate any input..Q1. ""Where is my relationship with X at the moment?""47.3>28  This one is pretty straightforward. I  perfectly understand the Oppression part.. And i do feel exausted as i am sure he does too.. And ofcourse 28..This is indeed stressfull for the both of us.Q2. ""In what direction is my relationship with X heading?"" 55.4.5>63  Ermm...Somewhere.. good.. i suppose? Not so sure about this one, although it does feel encouraging.(any ideas?)Q3. ""Concedering the above what would be the appropriate behaviour on my part      towards X?"" 21.6>51  LOL! Arabella's thread came to mind. So much easier when I give advice to others... This felt like the Yi was telling me off. So, there's something I refuse to listen to..OK.. And I guess the ""appropriate behaviour"" would be to simply ""open my ears"" (?). But..Q4 ""What am i not hearing?"" 57  This is the one that puzzled me the most. I think that 57 unchanged was the answer i expected the least.. I'm failing to listen to the wind? (the Wind of Change maybe?). I am not getting it. What is the actual advice of 57, other than ""be gentle"" or ""gently penetrating""? And how does that answer my question? Any suggestions? (Funny thing is we've had a couple of days with really strong winds where i live which only now seem to have calmed down..).55>63 and 57 are the ones i mostly need help with. However any thoughts are always welcome and helpful. They give a fresh, objective perspesctive and I could certainly use that!! Thank you all once again!LoveA.:bows:"
31,"Hello,I received this reading twice. Someone I am sort of seeing has had some bad news re a close family member. I was with him when it happened, so I left. We'd spent some time together, brief made briefer, but during much of that time there was awkwardness (due to negative thoughts swirling around my head adding to my inability to be relaxed but also perhaps awkwardness would perhaps have been there anyway even if I was a happy individual ie. maybe it's not right for either of us). But other times it was good. We have a lot in common and fancy each other, yet... perhaps it's all down to my social anxiety. I also think I betrayed some of my insecurity to him which may have put him off. And as a result of my issues  he may not feel he can get comfort from me at this time because I myself am not strong, and maybe wants to call it a day. Or perhaps where it really matters, we are just incompatible. Added to this too is physically going our separate ways fairly soon. But I know I have feelings for him, I'd still like to carry on. But, maybe I am more inclined to want that for my own peace of mind, perhaps regardless, because of the overall attraction? To protect my ego? Perhaps I'm in denial, or perhaps there's no such thing as perfect in relationships? We are both quite shy. Almost communicate better when not face to face  I have a feeling we can still be friends, but the subtext may be that it's over (the romance).I asked 'does he love me?' (bit dramatic I know but it came out...)43.2,5 > 55I then asked Why hasn't he been in touch yet? 43.2,5 > 55 (really I know the answer to this, the bad news was very recent so he's attending to that. And he's probably confused about me as I am about him (although I like him more I think (and I think he knows this), or maybe even want/need him more, than he does me (as he is happier in himself and better-adjusted).But it would be great if I could be a source of comfort to him in his time of need, but maybe my ego gets in the way. I also had this reading when asking 'What did he think of my behaviour when he saw me last'?: 50.3 Hilary: The vessel is being remade, and as its ‘ears’ – its carrying loops – are changed, it’s not yet ready to bemoved and used. This is like someone who is not open to connect with others. Even though there isgood within them, it remains inaccessible, so people go unnourished and immediate needs are not met.But this need not last. Rain will fall over all the fields of the realm, releasing tension and liberatingblocked potential; seeds stirred from their dormancy will begin to grow. Regrets diminish little by little,in this larger view and longer term. My views on 43.2,5 > 55: In this I see well, have no fear? I am in a bit of shock right now, so I feel quite calm. Also he didn't dump me per se, it was bad timing. Could be me I suppose - perhaps he hasn't gone off me completely? - or maybe it's about his reaction to his bad news. He doesn't want to cry out, doesn't want to talk about his fear re. his bad news. And perhaps he is removing weeds - me in this case, because maybe the awkwardness there isn't just teething troubles... he's clearing the ground so that he can see again (perhaps our 'failure' has eclipsed (depressed) us both.

33,"So I decided to ask the Yi about this situation i'm in.I'm trying to promote a student group at my university. The group is a new one, and it's stands alone in it's own right. That is it's not a popular topic for most people. ""How can I make my group more successful?""Hexagram 55.3.4.5 -> 1955 Shows a climax. I don't think the group is in it's climax. I've just started it. The only climax I can think of is the amount of work it's been recently. This evening I had a meeting. Nobody showed up. I didn't really care because school and other things have been keeping me busy. I didn't promote the meeting this evening, as I was too lazy. Nonetheless flyers that I have passed out do show the meeting's time and place. It's hard to get anyone to give a **** about really anything, and even more hard to get them to show up and commit time and invest in doing something that pertains to it. Abundance seems to be more about me. I feel like there are just allot of things to do, and I don't even have the time or energy to work on this thing all the time. I don't want this group project to dominate my entire life. I have other things I'd like to do. Or perhaps it's saying this about the student population? Perhaps it's suggesting another time to schedule the meeting? Line 2: I have had people attack me for my group (the kinds of people who drive me personally to create this group in the first place) they have complained to staff members and i've received complaints about it. Suffice to say my group is one that doesn't meet the status quo, in fact it challenges it. Perhaps this line is also reflecting my lack of energy recently to really put much effort into it? Line 3: I think this line shows just how difficult the group idea and purpose is. Anyone can **** on it. But that is just the nature of the topic at hand or situation. Line 4: Seems to show some progress taking place. Perhaps me throwing the Yijing has helped shift things a bit... I often wondered if the Yijing doesn't just predict and advice but manifest. but I digress. This line seems to give some hope. Also in reflection of 55. I think it could suggest that I need to make many occasions to promote the group. Perhaps this is the true meaning. That I need to just promote the **** out of it. I haven't really done that. I've put up signs about it, passed out flyers a couple of times. It's expensive to make the flyers and one of my posters was lost. It's just a pain in the ass really. I care about the group, but I don't want to be a slave to it. This time I didn't promote the group at all, and nobody showed up. Last time a few people showed up... This I think is a element of what 55 means here. 19I think could signify a future progress, and probably also suggest the need to tolerate the reactions of the masses, and their disinterest. Any help in interpretations would be appreciated."
34,"So I finally did a divination on this situation that i've been unable to take much action in changing. I had someone who is somewhat a mentor to me, who has been a teacher to  me for about a decade, come up to me and disrespect me to my face. I did not really put up any fight, because he choose the time and place, and I had other things to do. For me it made no sense, and came from nowhere. I didn't know how to respond to it, So I just shook his hand and thanked him for his input. Things with this guy have often been edgy. Since then I have not spoken to him or seen him. It's almost been a year now. So I threw a divination and this is what I got:""Any advice to me on X?"" (x being the guy i'm talking about) 36.1.2.3.5.6 -> 59That is allot of change going on. Which I think can perhaps describe the intensity and difficulty of this situation aptly. Line 1: shows gossiping going on. Which is about me. He told me people were gossiping about me. Line 2: Perhaps illustrates the injury to the relationship? It appears it isn't fatal. That is, it can go on? Not sure. Line 3: Seems as though some kind of luck has gone in the direction of clearing things up. Not sure. Line 5: Perhaps shows me in my situation. I am stuck, and unconvinced by pretty much everything he said. Line 6: Some kind of downfall, of whatever that started this? Pretty dramatic line. 59Can represent a ending of a relationship, or perhaps it can represent a ending of a negative aspect to it. Not sure. ---So I was trying to ascertain what I should do. Weather I should continue with this guy or not. I have left the city of residence where I used to live. So I'm nowhere near him now. But this hexagram: 36 doesn't advice giving up. In fact I can't think of a hexagram that does. I think the major theme of 36 is persevere in adversity. as the judgement mentions. Any advice to interpreting this would be appreciated."
35,"I asked iching 'will my bf come back to me' because we are taking a break after a huge fight and I got 8.3.5.

I got 42.4 to 25I interpreted it as, yeah, you've got a huge chance of just increasing business in general and more than likely you'll act as an intermediator (editor/writer/producer) yourself OR an intermediator will help YOU.

38,"Hi Everyone,I started dating a guy a few weeks ago whom I met online.  We hit it off immediately and have gone on 2 dates.  There was a week between our first and second date, but he contacted me nearly every day during that period.  The second date was great, but when he dropped me off he said the next week was going to be busy and he would probably not be available until the following week, but that he definitely wants to go out again.  He also said he would like to stay in contact during this busy week.  Then, he followed up with a text message the next day saying he had a great time and was excited to go out again.  We ended up texting all day that day.  But since then, I've heard nothing.  It's been 3 days, AND I noticed he's been active on the dating site where we met.  Normally I wouldn't think it was a big deal that a few days have gone by without contact, but since he'd established a pattern of every day contact, I'm wondering how to interpret/handle the situation.  (NOTE: I'm terrible at knowing the ""rules"" of dating, so I just never know when/if something is a big deal or not) I asked the I Ching how to handle it and it gave me 21.4 Biting Through --> 27 Corners of the Mouth (Nourishment)Thoughts?"

40,"Hello,I ask for your insights to help me with this passage....My experience in the 8 day silent retreat was extraordinary - deeply fulfilling and a precious time of light, beauty and real depth of joy.  I received such blessings - light, visions, hope, gratitude and totally unexpectedly the tranformative power of prayer and Christ.  It could not have been a more powerful or precious time with light and joy just flooding through me for hours on end. St.Beaunos was the subject of a BBC programme 'The Big Silence' and as soon as I saw it I was drawn to go - which is how I ended up there 6 months later.Back now and feeling the shadow side of the light - all this startling and electric energy inside with no place to go as such.  Am based between my supportive family but feel the  pressure & need to ground and act in order to make the most of this potential energy. (26 was my focus now, unchanging).  My husband is coming back for one month on April 5th before starting his year at the buddist retreat centre.  I received the hexagram 28 with lines 2 and 6 for guidance for this time - such is my overwhelming state with needing to find my way that I couldn't really form a question about it as such.  And so, asked for advice only on this time.28:2 seemed to be a very good way of looking at it - that there is the potential for new growth now and for a means of revitalising the relationship - but with line 28:6 advice not to go in over your head and get dragged back into the uncertainties and problems.  I have managed in the retreat to detach from him and feel good and excited about this new period of growth for us both in our own individual ways.  Dobro mentions in a thread that line 28:6 can also mean not to go in over your head in thoughts about it - which I am very tempted to do when I go into fear mode.But the question remains - with so much spinning around - what to do?  I feel that a community would be a good place for me right now - to face the anxieties I have about being out of my comfort zone and also to be with others where the acts of worship are the foundation of their lives - incorporating prayer, meditation into the day before being busy in the community.  I received hexagram 16:5 - 45 for this - which suggested to me that this could be a purposeful step and 16:5 seemed to be addressing my anxieties which arise from imaging the negative and fearful side of it.  Looking towards the one local one and asking about being there for a while - I received 44:1, 2 and 4 - 37.  Now I realise that this is an awful lot of questions to ask and I've seen on the forum that generally people who ask too much in one thread tend to get few insights possibly because its all too much - but I wanted to put it all into context.  Maybe one of you will feel drawn to answering just one bit of it.  So, I offer it here and my thoughts on the 44 lines are quite confused to be honest.  I can be a bit like the pig who has everything going - all the transformative power, the insight, the richness, but whose own imaginings can cause such a huge entangling if allowed to be unleashed.  I have been blessed lavishly and really want to use this time for growth and to find my way - I could not be more hungry for it or eager - and so I ask for your experience and wisdom to help if you will on any aspect of it?...Hebe"
41,"For the benefit of anybody new to this site [because otherwise you've heard the ongoing saga already]; I'm trying to sell the one asset I've got:  a home in France.  For a year and a half, nothing substantial although there are viewers now and again.  It's a big place, used to be a hamlet of three small houses of ages from 300 years old to 8 years old, Perfect I'm thinking for a B&B, mostly renovated with a bit left to do that would make a great commercial property in a perfect location for that, four miles from the main north-south motorway with seven bedrooms, four baths, two livingrooms, library, office, commercial ktichen.  I'm thinking that's the way I  need to head as this is maybe too big for one family.  OK,  enough explanation on that score.The house-sitter, who has been there nearly three years already, can only stay through this year and won't be there into the Autumn again. Once a property is sold in France it often takes three or four months to close the deal -- SO -- time to get cracking.There have been suggestions lately to rent the place, divide it in two, and so forth.  None of these ideas is straightforward [there is only one heating system for the whole place for instance] and might not even be allowed due to the type of zoning.  I've thought of auctioning -- knowing I'll lose my shirt probably.  But it's getting desperate at this stage and I need the funds from it that I can have.  I've cast for:  ""What is the best way to sell this property quickly?"" and received:  24.4 becoming 51.  Yipes.  Hope it gets struck by lightening?  "
42,"Hello everyone - after a long time, I am here not seeking career advice. I've now been made permanent in the company where I was originally a temp and the wandering stage of my life has finally come to a close. Becoming more settled and embarking on a career gave me a chance to reflect on other areas of my life which I have neglected due to the financial struggle I had been going through. This post is in regards to a friendship that used to mean much to me but ended up badly, over a year ago. My best friend and I got into an argument not over a specific issue but a situation that escalated over a few months and finally got us to a breaking point. In our last conversation I hung up on X and that was it - we never heard from each other again. I never e-mailed X and X never e-mailed me. Nothing. What started the decay was a bad event which happened to my friend; X found out they were very ill and this changed their character and also treatment of other people. To this day I am probably one of maybe 3 people in the world who know about the illness.For all this time I thought about X a lot. I often realise that not a day passes that I don't remember our friendship, what we shared, how I felt loved and cared for. But in my heart of hearts I feel that it is too late now and that we will never go back to how we used to be. The true aim of this post is to seek liberation and leave the ghost of X in the past. No regrets, no making decisions about new friends in my life to somehow reflect this past friendship. Just the future and putting an end to this chapter. I want to contact X and make amends but am worried they'll retaliate and even more so, that they won't care. Mostly I just want freedom from the past. My questions: 1.What will happen if I contact X?    7.2.3 > 152. What is the best thing to do?     25.3.4.5>223. What does X feel for me?     55.2>344. The best way forward for our relationship?     37.3>42 -- this is the only answer that makes any sense to me.  Overall the answers do not seem too dramatic!I'd very much love to hear your thoughts.

50,"After over a year of consulting medical specialists my health problems are not resolved, though very slowly improving.  Recently I've taken a holistic route focusing on diet, supplements and a mind/body approach incorporating yoga, meditation, spending time in nature.  While my frame of mind is improved I'm generally exhausted, hardly working, and socializing even w close friends feels draining.  I asked the Yi, what's the single most effective step I can take to improve my health and received 45.3.  Line 3 talks about isolation.  Is this advice to be out & about more, or instead to take time out to nourish myself until I feel stronger?

59,"Hi All,I asked about ""what if I tried to apply for a job at company X?"" (overseas, where I used to live) and the answer I got is 55.3.4. changing to 24 (return). I know 55 is abundance although the lines aren't exactly that auspicious. What confuses me is, my current situation related to his question isn't in a state of abundance at all, probably even the opposite. So, the way I see it there are three ways I can think about in interpreting this:1. Hex 24 represents my situation, wanting to return, and by returning I get abundance through the job. This is what my intuition is telling me but the cause and effect order is in reverse. Normally I'd read the changing lines keeping in the back of my mind what the new situation will become *due* to these changing lines. Now that I reverse the situation, how can I understand them since I no longer have a point of reference? 2a Somehow, I apply and I get the job and that leads to abundance and the result is I have returned? I feel this is a long shot but could still make sense.2b. Like 2a, I got the job, leads to abundance and nature takes its course leading to decline and I have to ""return"" i.e. leaving the country company X is in? Well, this one I really don't think it makes any sense but I am listening...Anyone can give me some advice on how to read this one properly? How would you read it if you got this line?

Because I will be there for two weeks and that's my only shot at really getting things done effectively, and the results are pivotal, I have been worried about getting an apartment and making contacts for employment during my visit which is coming up this May.Finding a place to live is absolutely important, my main concern in all the planning.I consulted the i ching saying I am worried about being able to find an apartment while there (not really a question just wanting some reassurance or advice, I suppose) and it responded with 50.2.3.4.6>2.Kind of at a loss as to what it is telling me. Cauldron is a vessel for hopes, dreams and transformation, all that is sacred and important cooked and made ready for a great offering that will nourish and enrich followed by hexagram 2 which to me means being open to receive without taking the lead.Since I didn't ask about actions, only confided that I am concerned and feeling anxious about the changes and actually being successful in my pursuits, I am wondering if this is saying that things are underway that will be ultimately be beneficial and fulfilling for my daughter and I (hex 50).All I have to do is not get in my own way (hex 2)?I hate asking about what will happen because well, anything can happen and I don't like being mislead or having false hopes. If you got this reading, how would you interpret it?Namaste"
62,"Hi everyone,1st time poster her tho I've been using some of the interpretation resources here for around a year or so. I recently did a reading for myself with the result Before Completion with no changing lines.The reading was in relation to my work in music which hasn't been going well for me for the last year or so. I quit a band that I'd done sound for going on 7 years in october last year and with it, quit a recording studio that I had spent quite a bit of time and effort setting up.Recently I've been trying to work on my own material and have been recording some guitar for a friend of mine who has some seriously good quality material in production at the moment.So, the question I asked the I Ching was:- Please tell me, what is the likely resolution of my current efforts as  musician?I'm struggling to interpret Before Completion as the result here. Could it mean hat a positive outcome is in store, with right-mindedness and attention to detail, or could it mean that I'm about to have my 'tail immersed'?I should add that I've been considering abandoning music as a way of life recently due to the amount of work I've done for very little reward and that I've been plagued by technical issues with my equipment since the new year. I know that Before Completion refers to some coming balancing of 'Karma' but I'm unsure whether to interpret this as advice to persevere as a musician or to just keep my guitar as a hobby instrument.Kind regards and many thanks in advice for your help,ad"
63,"Hi,My subsciption to the Change Circle has just ended and I ask the yijing whether should I join the Change Circle again.My answer:17.1.2, 47My interpretations:Line 1: Go out and mingle freely with all sorts of people, friends to achieve something.Line 2: If he throws himself away on unworthy friends he loses connection with people of intellectual power who could further him in the good.May I have your insights and advises please."
64,"Hi,I reconnected with my ex a few months back and we've been slowly but surely getting to a pretty good place, though she still lives in another country right now.Long and short, 2 days prior to my birthday she sent me a book on how to find a good partner, which I found to be very thoughtless and bewildering since we were trying to reconcile. I was polite in an email, thanking her and telling her I would read it but she sensed I was confused by it and instead of trying to allay my fears, she called me the day before my birthday to berate me and accuse me of saying she is manipulative (I never actually said that though!)  I tried to speak with her calmly, but she hung up on me and never called on my actual birthday the next day no matter all my calls and texts, though I was upset in my texts as the day went on.  I finally got a hold of her days later and she was unapologetic and we parted ways as a result.Thing is, we both love each other very deeply, but she has had commitment and trust issues that have made things toxic. And though I'm no angel, it's been tough for me to get past her walls on not lose my temper or get fed up and break contact occasionally. I wish I knew how to get back to where we once were in the beginning before she became so scared all the time.Okay, you got through all that - here's the question:I have to see my doctor in april/may and he happens to be in her home city/country. It's important I go. How will she respond if I email her to inform her now that I'm coming in April or May and I thought she should know, but it would be nice to be able to say hello?I got 55, with changing line 5 --> 49This seems positive, but I asked something close to this question yesterday - should i tell her when i get there that i am in town? - and it said not to persevere and that it would cause further distance between us. I think it was 37.1.6.  Thanks for the help!Blu7"

66,"40.2.4.5 > 8It feels as if since 2000 there has been alot of natural and 'man-made' disasters and the latest earthquake in Japan, as is being discussed in a few other threads, has made me think back to the twin towers. I asked what significance does this have for us humans?Both images have water...thunder and rain, water over earth. The arousing and water as a down pour of emotion. the earth below which remains despite all the shakes, floods crashes etc etc. And the water that washes over it clearing and making space.from the wiki wing for 8:8 in its purest sense can be the clear open fertile plain after the floods abate. Tabula rasa, where the new world can be created out of relationships. Some ‘erasing’ might be needed first.Click to expand...Its almost impossible to not feel these diasters on a personal level because of our telecommunications, we can see and hear it all. Weirdly on March 11 my bathroom and kitchen flooded with water from the mains, its was quite synchronistic when I later heard about Japan. 40.2One kills three foxes in the fieldAnd receives a yellow arrow.Perseverance brings good fortune.Click to expand...Hmm how to apply this without being insensitive? For me there is a sense that from what gets destroyed remains people and their stories of how they pulled together (katrina I suppose had a lot of looting though). 40.4Deliver yourself from your great toe.Then the companion comes,And him you can trust.Click to expand...Also release the thumbs, which I relate to a lot more, let go of your grip.

68,"My lease here is nearly finished, which nearly everyone on this site must know by now!  I've looked high and low for another place and found nothing.  Fortunately as just the last moment friends are ""lending"" me a furnished cottage on their estate for five weeks and, in that period of time, I have to find another place and move -- again.I'm not complaining, I'm lucky to have this ""breather"" but I'm really worried that in this time frame I won't turn up something else.  Really scarey.  So I've asked the Yi ""what do I need to do to find a new home?""  And the answer makes no sense to me:Hex 33.6 becoming Hex 31?  Retreating, sweet or otherwise, would seem to be the last thing needed at this moment.  I was thinking more of an all-out effort and some option that was eluding me.  I never expected to hear that I should back off and make less effort than I've done already.  Baffling, no?"

Therefor, he feels those costs should come off the legal amount of child support he pays.  It's very sad.

72,"Have just completed my second radio ""talk"" show today, having been relatively satisfied with the first one, although i can see there is room for improvement and a lot to learn.  My guest on the programme this week was a chatterbox and rather than conversing I was lmited to the odd comment and exclamatory remarks.  I don't know how this will come across to the audience and, after some further challenges editing the recording I hope we didn't chop it to bits.  Thus my question of the Yi:  how successful have I been in creating this week's radio programme?  The casting, as you see is Hex 57.1.2.3 becoming Hex 42.Individually, each of the moving lines sounds relatively positive in relation to a ""seal assignment"" and expressing oneself without questioning whether that expression is right or wrong.  So this is comforting.  But what about the caution of ""shame"" in the third line?  Now that seems a bit dire even with Hex 42 -- which I always have found positive and uplifting -- in the background.Last edited: Mar 17, 2011"
73,"Hello, everyone. I was curious about yi's advice on how to make a relationship work.I thought this was an interesting response and so I wanted to share it.Hexagram 17.2.3.5.6>14Follow the relationship as if it were a Great Possession? Makes sense. Now if I can understand the balance of lines 2 and 3.Perhaps it is saying that there is a time for acting young and lighthearted fun (line 2) but to make sure to balance it with the ability to be mature when the time calls for it (line 3).Lines 5 and 6 seem self explanatory, at least I think they do. Line 5 being almost an encouragement to follow what your heart truly desires despite setbacks.Line 6 used to confuse me but I have come to see it as a very close bond that is hard to shake.Trying to fit hexagram 14 into this reading. Perhaps it is a description of what kind of attitude to have towards a relationship? Or even how to see the relationship.Wondering if I am being too superficial with this assessment. Namaste::bows::"
74,"I asked ""What will happen to Japan over the next 30 days?"" and got 18.1.5.  DECAY.This is the first time I've ever gotten anything that seemed to be ridiculous. Decay and nuclear reactions may fit, but there is nothing else that seems to fit.  Well, there is  (Paraphrasing) ""What happened originally will happen again within three days.""I can easily believe that another quake/tsunami is about to hit Japan, but it's already the 15th in Japan as I write.  I believe that the quake was on the 11th.On another note, Kyodo news is reporting a most serious situation at the number 2 Fukushima reactor.  It has exploded again and the containment vessel is damaged.  The engineers were evacuated.  If I'm not wrong, that means the worst is unfolding.So I'm not sure how the success of DECAY has much to do with this very serious situation for the world.What did I miss?"
75,"I have been reading articles saying there were indeed weapons of mass destruction found in iraq but not the sort the public has been lead to believe they were looking for.

76,"Hello everyone,As some of you know from my previous threads, I am currently experiencing living under a very difficult neighbour who seem to have quite inexplicably decided to make my life here unbearable. It would be against my higher nature for me to retaliate (although my lower nature sees every sense in the eye for the eye scenario... but hey, who's the boss here?!), so I have now decided to move out of this environment which is becoming more and more toxic even as I write.Now, when I asked ""How much longer do I need to put up with my current neighbour?', I got the hexagram EARTH, unchanging.Now, this hexagram came up a lot for me lately. It seem to feature in answers to all my questions, from what's up with my love life to how to go about seeking a peaceful home, to what my priorities are right now and even how to stop recreating detrimental patterns in my life.... In fact, it came up 6 times as present, and 5 times as future hexagram thus far. Intriguing, no?But... What does it mean for me?Thank you,Grace"

If I partially stay I will get itchy feet perhaps and it looks promising to me about the move to a new place but there seems to be a lot about indecision and coming and going.

95,"I reached a very literal breaking point today when I had planned to give a gift of thanks and appreciation to someone I hold (more than) very dear in my heart. I had planned all week and the planning involved help from others, including rental cars, rearranging appointments (or finding out if they could be arranged) to make the delivery smooth.When I called the person to tell them about the gift, they had other plans. But that's not the problem. I counteroffered with another date/time and it fell on deadness/that wont work. I then said I will be in the area again next Friday, but mentally the message had already been sent to me.This delivery -- and maybe its my fault-- but it symbolized a great deal to me. It symbolized building a deeper friendship, giving back, extending my own care. I looked forward to taking the half day necessary to create and deliver the gift. I was very excited. The potential recipient didnt counter offer to pick it up on another day or give me another day when i could deliver it. In the course of our talk I found otu they have other plans with the same group i have bene trying to join (socially). And so the pain has hit two-fold: first bc this person is not allowing me ""in"" and secondly since I'm not ""in"", i cannot meet others and make more friends in the group.I asked why this person will not reciprocate and got 9.1.2.3.5.6>2. I read the Exploring Divination thread but it makes no sense.They speak of climbing up the steep hill with sleds and then (hex 10) the entire group goes sledding together down the hill. But there, in my reading, there is no group. Its only solitary aloneness, as far as my eyes and heart can see, both backwards and forwards into the future. I have done all I can. I feel broken and unable at this point (given the events of the past month or so) to continue trying to be friends when it's a one-way street. But what is the Yi saying with this reading? It doesnt seem a case of ""they want to take it slow"". This is more negative than that, as it seems.Furthermore, this circles back to my own attempts to make my own life richer and fuller, seek and build a bigger social network, not just focus on work. but my attempts at doing this are falling flat. And I'm really beyond despaire at this point (as many of you from recent other threads know). I welcome any help/advice."
96,"Hi,I thought of asking this question, so I put up to the IC and get this answer,40.4.6, 4.My interpretations:Hex 40 may refer to my inner freedomHex 4 to cultivating my character(moving lines: to educate, discipline is important but not too much)Therefore, cultivating my character to inner freedom.In Hex 40 Line 4: free myself from bad influences and behaviours.In Hex 40 Line 6: Take forceful steps to eliminate bad habit.I also ask for the Patterns of Change:Inside is hex 5: keep my ultimate goal before me.Outside is hex 35: I must live by those values to make progressConclusion: my analysis is that I have a challenging task in front of me.

I have received Hexagrams 18 and 54(never talked about that one) on several occasions, I'm getting 3.2. I am really attracted to this woman and now she will not write back. Additionally, she really told me all her hidden problems and trusted me immensely and told me so.

101,"There is a woman who is spreading lies about me. I don't know what the lies are exactly, but based on her actions, people are turning on me. I asked the Yi how can I combat her evil influence? It gave me 16.1.3.6. Before I analyze the lines, a few other points:-my approach the past 4 months has been simply to disappear. However, she gets word of what i'm doing from mutual acquaintances/friends who do not ""see"" her evil, and then turns them against me based on ...whatever black magic is that she manages to say. Bc i do not talk to her, I dont know exactly what she says. But it is powerful enough to disrupt my own life an dplans.-One issue involved people attending my birthday party. They agreed to come and I got a call out of the blue from her just 5 days prior (had not spoken to her in 6 weeks). It became clear she had gotten wind of the party. I didnt asnwer the call. The guests who agreed to come did not show up, gave a lame excuse. Incidents such as this happen repeatedly. SHe has this way of manipulating things so that I cannot enjoy my life or achieve the results I want.-Part of what I am trying to achieve is to become part of a cultural language group that she's sort of a part of. I have avoided it bc of her. Then it dawned on me that I wont get anywhere by avoidance. So i thought, keep your enemies closer. I left her a message today congratulating her on a cultural holiday and saying we should have coffee sometime. I wonder if the Yi is saying this is NOT the best approach.Now the lines:l1: proclaiming satisfaction and pleasure: there will be evil; do not declare what you want. Do not show off. (so i should not open up to her about my deepest desires/goals but does this mean do not involve myself w/her at all?)L3: he looks for favors and places reliance on the others withou realizing that he too should take action. If you do not appreciate the right time for movement, you will regret it. Moving at the worng time suggests bad judgement. Withdraw. Showing enthusiasm can be seen as insincere. (this maybe implies this meeting suggestion was a bad idea? I do not know what ""action"" it is that I should take here...or what the ""right"" time for movement is.)L6: No error. It is easy to be led astray by foolish enthusiasm but at the last moment a sober awakening can save the situation. Change of course is advised.  I'm not too enthused about seeing or hanging out with her. But if the reason she's telling lies (without even speaking to me or interacting w/me) is bc she is jealous or threatened, i thought seeing/talking to her (not about that but about anything under the sun) could help.I welcome any input..."
102,"Hello All,   I am new this forum but have followed this website for quite some time now.I have been consulting the I Ching for many years but since visiting here and reading through so many new and different perspectives,I have really changed the way I view the oracle and changed the way I approach it.I am very grateful and excited to be a new member and grateful to all of the members here for their dedication...I've learned so much since visiting this site and I'm eager to learn as much as I can now that I'm signed up!I would really love any input at all to the Hexagrams I threw.I am very drawn to a man and have been for quite some time.He is a single father to several...I am a single mother.It would seem an impossible pairing though as he is a very good and longtime friend of my ex husband.He visits from out of town on occasion and the feeling is just so intense that I felt I would ask finally..My question was What are his feelings towards me?and I received ""Progress"" Hex 35.1.2.4.5 changing into 61 ""Inner Truth""I also asked What will be the outcome if I show interest?and received Hexagram ""Following"" 17.3.4.6 changing into 37 ""The Family""I am a little thrown off by the conflicting multiple changing lines...I thank you so much ahead of time for any help!"

104,"Hello all,Having been doing more homework for the past few days, I feel it's time to approach a certain person A but this time around it is mainly to convince him that I have the skills  to make the project work. At this point, I consider this person to be the key to the project success so I asked the Yi:What can I expect if I present my ideas and offer to A?27 unchanging. I think the Yi is telling me that I need to be careful about what comes out of my mouth as in I need to better structure my pitch?Upon asking for clarification, the Yi responded:29.4 > 47. Whoa! If I remember correctly, the abyss is never a good sign as it is associated with danger? But upon reading a few translations, I think it could also be saying that I should deal with my fear (well I am a bit nervous about his potential response) and line 4 says it's not a mistake. However, 47 (Oppression?) also doesn't sound good at all.I then asked for an alternative path:What can I expect to go ahead with this project without A?1.2 > 13. My take is, it seems like the Yi is telling me that the potentials of this project is coming to realization? But I still don't quite understand how that relates to A?One last reading, I'm scheduled to meet one of the project's stakeholder, lets call him E (BTW if A was on board, it would make my dealings with E a lot easier). I asked:What could I expect if I were to meet up with E this week?23.1.5 > 42. Splitting apart? The leg of the bed is split (line 1)? Shoal of fishes? Favor through court ladies (line 5)? I can't make a single thing out of these! But 42 (Increase) seems to suggest some sort of happy ending?Sorry for the long post and multiple readings folks but they are all interrelated and there's a bit of dynamics going on in the situation too.So confirmation, new insights, comments, criticisms are all greatly appreciated. :bows:Thank youVince"
105,"My lease is up and I need to find a new place to live.  I'm currently in a safe neighborhood near the ocean and would love something similar.  I asked the Yi if I will find a home or apartment that I will be happy in.  The answer was 54.5, which I take to mean to keep my expectations realistic and even humble, and I will be happy with where I end up.  I am feeling a bit lackadaisical about finding somewhere but need to be out of my current place in 2 weeks.   The advice however does encourage that a positive situation (changing to Hex 58) will come.  Perhaps an apartment that's a bit run down &/or not in the ideal location (LiSe's 'don't demand the best place or perfection')?I then asked the Yi how will I find my next place and received 51.6. ????  I guess I'd better start looking for a place before the lightening hits me...  I was hoping for a clue on the best way to look as I've combed ads, looked at a couple of options but nothing feels like a fit.Last edited: Jan 25, 2011"
106,"28.2.4.6 and 53A wise man told me that hex 28 signifies overload. ie the ridgepole is too heavy. I know some interpretations suggest this is a sexual implication but, if it isn't taken as such, then what are the other options?Is 28 significant of overcommitment in terms of tasks and appointments, or of other *people* or relationships? And does 53 mean that things will happen as I want them to eventually or essentially just not happen at all?If anyone has experience with 28 in terms of a barrier to something I would love to hear what it was."
107,"Hello,I am just wondering about the issue of tactics in love. For example, the female playing coy, the male chasing, because the female has more to lose if she doesn't secure the male and he scarpers when she's pregnant... Which may still be active in more adaptible females (?) Or are we more than animals and love and respect does exist, aside from selfishly? Or do men get bored easily? (I don't mean to sound sexist in this thread but I am a woman so what can I do?)Basically I am always nice, I think, in relationships. I don't consciously play the game, but maybe I should!! I do see in myself, that in the past I have tended to like a person more the less interested they seem in me... although not strictly... And I feel when I properly like someone, I like them more the more attention they give me! So maybe it's all a myth... I am currently sort of seeing someone, long-distance; friendly communication and reciprocal so far, but I do feel like I'm usually the one waiting around for him, ie. he seems more in the driving seat. Is this because I'm not playing the game? I do think he's more busy than I am though, so I'm counting the days more than he is... My mother says I should play it cooler... like he seems to be... but I have seem to have more faith than that (strange considering my experiences...)What I'm trying to get at is, as long as you're not overly/weirdly/desperately keen, friendly encouragement wouldn't put someone off who really likes you? After all, they say love is blind. So maybe someone will like you, fundamentally, almost regardless of how hot or cool you play it? Or am I being naive?I asked:Is love a game?Hex 18Seems to suggest treating it as such, could cause rot. And my mum has never been lucky in love, is still single, but she has had experience and in the past when she's advised me to play it cooler, she has been right... (but I'm too nice/can't help myself! I like to communicate/share... and treat guys as friends rather than potential prizes...)What can you tell me about 'treat 'em mean keep 'em keen'?Hex 28.5 > 32It's ok but then the relationship would lack gusto? You may get the man, but it wouldn't be based on truth, but the appearance of flowers grown from something dead/old becuase you weren't yourself????What can you tell me about 'real' love:46.2,3 > 2I like this I think. Give (to a degree, what you have, naturally...) without being afraid of not receiving (?) (46.2) and have faith (line 3) but also don't expect too much (line 3). Don't be quite so scared, be natural. Follow the signs (hex 2). I have in the past, and perhaps even again now a bit, denied negative signs becuase I've so wanted things to work out... but I don't think I'm pushing him in this relationship so far, but maybe I am in my predictable friendliness? Will he get bored!? Or does he like being respected?... hmmm... Also I know there is the difference between men and women's brains (i.e. men are less inlcined to communicate unless the girl is in front of their noses...)Any thoughts and interpretations would be most welcome on this most confusing of subjects :bows:"
108,"When will I find myself? Hexagram 21.6 to 51This is a scary answer.  I asked this question regarding my identity and who I am.

It sounds almost like Im heading for a roller coaster ride of my life, and I hate roller coasters.Someone please shed some light on this..."
109,"Hello..I am trying to get clear on where we're going with our marriage - for as much as I try to leave it alone and get on with my life - I am not really able to at this point - although am much more relaxed about it I think.  A few days ago I asked 'How should I approach our relationship?' and received 25:4 - 42.  I read it over and over - feeling how it felt to disentagle - trying to see where the negative emotions were/are holding me back - and on line 4: - seeing that (Wing) it spoke to me very much about being true to myself, not being influenced by others, trusting my inner vision.  The relating hexagram of 42 felt good, but made me question - what am I pouring blessings,love into - myself or the marriage - am i to be constant to myself and hence feel where to go and what to do - or is it advising me to pour love and commitment as I am doing, into the marriage whilst he sorts himself out.Feeling the confusion of this - not sure if the I Ching is referring to me or the marriage itself - I asked:' what can I expect from our marriage?' and received 13 unchanging.  This is very interesting because I have just heard from him and he has been almost accepted onto a years position back in UK, residential, at a well known buddist retreat centre - well known as it is well thought of should I say for the visiting teachers and flourishing community as a teaching / volunteer community.  Changing his plans, but the earthquake threw up alot of questions for him.13 - having things in common, and according to Hilary, in romantic relationshings think of building friendship and enjoying one anothers company.  ' There is a reference once again - as in 25 - about harvest in constancy - and also the line that I need to think about : one who makes no corrections commits blunders - and according to Hilary - be particularly cautious about planning, making sure it isn't based on misconceptions.Sorry for so much writing.  I guess I am asking if you have any experience with these lines and hexagrams that open it us to anything more definitive.  I question whether 13 will be enough for me in the long run - but what do I really know about 13 - it could be perfect harmony 'in the wilds' - going outside the normal box of marriage.  Any thoughts?"

My inner conflict was ""should I go tonight on the promotion and meet her there, or to meet her some other day"".I asked a question: ""Is it favorable to go tonight on her promotion""?I received 11 with changing line 5 which is really favorable, but than, the 2nd hexagram is 5 - Waiting.

116,"Any help on interpretation is appreciated.We have been in a long distance relationship. He's travelling (he already made a decision to travel for a year before we got together and I had decided to move interstate to study before we got together). We really wanted to give it a go. He rarely calls, he wrote me an email in which i found a line 'need some time out'. Like i had to chance upon those few words in a sentence.I was so hurt. We have been having arguements over his female friend who told me there will be things shared between them that's exclusive only to them. Might I add she was my best friend who got lonely and jealous of the connection me and him were starting to have. I expressed my hurt over being bullied into a confrontation by her,while he accepts she was wrong, he allows her to maintain and create deeper friendships. It's only friendship but why is he nurturing a deeper friendship with someone who tried to hurt me. Anyways this issue has got his head 'unscrewed' and effectively he says he has no relationship with her, not until we can sort this out he says. Then he takes his time off, I have no idea when he's 'back'. After 4 days he replied...it was an email saying he apologises if he came across as hurtful or brash. I am currently a student and against my means tried to pool my resources to go and see him in China. There was not a single loving sentence that acknowledged what I was trying to do. But in his last email he said he would love to have me there.Query: But I feel this relationship deserves more than it is getting. I deserve more. My decision to break up with him.62.2.5 ->28I agree with 28, but the lines seems to suggest being small cos this will be an enduring connection. So I feel a bit of contradiction cos 28 is to stand together regardless or we will fall apart.Can anyone shed some insight? I asked for clarification and recieved 63.1.6->53Again i feel contradiction.I strongly feel i deserve better, what's the point of having someone care greatly for you if words, mere words, is all they can offer."
117,"Thanks to this wonderful forum I'm learning new things everyday, thank you all! Recently an old friend appeared in my life which is wonderful, but when I ask the i-ching about it it seems to warn me. I get lots of 44 and 29.Since it puzzled me (it is a really nice friendship) I asked the i-ching what the danger is about and I got 11 unchanged! I've read several explanations of hex 11 but it seems like such a positive hex. This really puzzles me: what could be 'dangerous' about 11?  Any thoughts on this?"

119,"Hi Everyone,So, I've been wheelin' and dealin', focusing solely on professional advancement in the past two months, putting all my time (and I mean ALL, for four months in a row I was working 80 hours a week, I barely got Christmas off!) into projects and so forth.I've met a new boy about a week and a half ago. I like him. But quite frankly, I've got stuff to do AND I'm feeling odd sexually/emotionally, because I've been out of the game for a while and my last relationship made me feel like a cadaver, so, I'm kind of scared to be intimate again.I saw him last Monday, randomly (my friend is trying to hook us up, and my friend stupidly decided to invite love interest over while I was over; love interest brought his cousin; they were all playing video games, while love interest boy was trying to get to know me, I was getting over bronchitis and a wild weekend of partying with my super crazy fun friends; long story short, it was awkward).Anyway, I know I should have totally sucked his lips off or something wild and daring (that's the kind of romantic energy we evoke in each other), but I'm holding back because I need to finish what I'm doing before I get lost in the throes of romantic passion. I'm freaking out because I hope I didn't give him the wrong impression; I'm ready for him later (maybe in like a month or something), but not RIGHT NOW; so I hope he still likes me.I asked Yi:*What is the likelihood that this boy has romantic feelings for me? I got 12.3.6 to 31What do you guys think of this answer? I think it indicates that he likes me, but I threw him off, but at the end of the day, when things are right, there's still a big chance of advancing."
120,"today I ws meditating about my life and later sat down and asked the I Ching:""Why am I here in this life, what's the sense and lesson??""as an answer I received 14.3.4.6 > 19and sat here quite in disbelief..  I had a horrible past esp. family wise and still have to deal with trauma, pain and unfulfilled hopes resulting from it - yet I received 14.3.4.6 .. it just doesn't seem to make any sense for medoes anyone have an idea of how to interpret this answer? maybe I just misunderstood it badly"
121,"Hi Everyone,I've consulted the I Ching about a few issues this week as I'm trying to get my life in order, tie up loose ends and move ahead on every front.  Today I asked about contacting a person from my past whom I dated and was friends with, but whom I now no longer talk to.  I feel like the way things ended with us was very immature (on both sides), where I felt like he was blowing me off but instead of confronting him directly about it I instead de-friended him on Facebook and cut him out entirely.  I had some built up anger towards him about some things that had happened in the past, and I think it just all came out at once with me taking drastic action.  We haven't spoken since.  This was about 5 months ago.  I've had some time to stop stewing about it and now realize I could/should have handled things much more gracefully and communicatively...so I'm left with unresolved feelings about it since I feel I jumped the gun with cutting him out of my life before I'd clarified what was going on and actually discussing the things I was pissed off about.  Again, very immature, I know.  I've grown a lot since this all happened.I wouldn't really want the relationship/friendship we once had again, but would like to feel like things are ""okay"" between us and maybe start slowly rebuilding the trust again if he's open to it.  I asked the I Ching:What does X think of me?  I got 17.2 Following --> 58 The Joyous Lake.  How would X likely respond if I contacted him in the near future?  I got 59.1.3 Dispersion --> 9 Taming Power of the SmallI'd love to hear people's thoughts!"

123,"Hi All,I asked Yi about a new project that I just came across that will require finding other investors in order to fund it:What can I expect from the possible cooperation in the project? The Yi responded 12.4.6 > 8. My take is that this will be a tough project and I will learn a lot from it but more importantly as indicated by line 6, things will turn out well where obstruction is being ended?  Two days later I started talking to more people about the project and received mixed response. I then asked the Yi:What is my best course of action regarding this project and received 45 unchanging.  Upon asking for more clarity, the Yi responded 64.2.5.6 > 45! My take in this hex is that I need to persevere in all the difficulties to get this project moving but line 6 really confuses me as I can't really make anything out of it. Some translation that I'm following says that there is confidence in me that is not based on reality of the project and I'm guessing I need to do much more research before committing to the project?Any insights will be much appreciated.Thank youVince"
124,"Hi Everyone,Nice to see you all again (virtually), sorry for neglecting the board, life was a storm for a while.Anyway, long story short, I'm in business with my friend who is a fashion designer, full partnership half and half. TOGETHER (ME coming up with the concept, her adding to it), we did a photo shoot, designed the look book for fashion week with a graphic designer and TOMORROW is the deadline for print. I am an editor/writer by trade, and we agreed that I would run the show on the print leg of the journey. She's been involved with the entire design process (giving opinions with each revision) and just yesterday she wants to play it safe, I'm supposing out of fear, and change the text flow; she's seen the layout before. She said it was ""amateurish"" and that it was ""her vision"", but her suggestions just look boring and safe, doesn't fit with the design or concept, just completely wrong. I can be swayed, not obstinate; but I won't compromise my high standards for print. I didn't interfere with her fashion designs, because I don't know what I'm talking about and I trusted her, but she's not trusting me and she's treating me like crap (*NOTE, through bronchitis and a whole bunch of life/financial/time sacrifices I put COUNTLESS HOURS, MONEY and EFFORT into this, along with the graphic designer, I got the location, the photographer, one of the models, the printer, paid half of everything; she works all day, and spews opinions). I'm ready to pull out and ask for all my money back, because I'm sick of her not trusting me professionally and not being grateful, quite frankly; she tried to do this herself before and nothing came of it; together, we're making magic. I NEED THIS TOO; this will launch my career as a copywriter in this city, so I need the look book to look BETTER than average, to have MORE punch than the rest. It's not just about her.I asked the I Ching:*What needs to be done about this situation? I got 17.2.4.5 to 19*What will be the likely result of having a heart-to-heart with her about this? 6.3.4 to 57*What is she likely to do? 44.5.6 to 32Thank you so much for your help.

129,"Would getting a job related to healthcare industry be a good profession for me?Hexagram 30 unchanging (To catch the bird of brightness)I guess this means perseverance and catching opportunities, so if I want a job related to healthcare industry I am going to have to seize the opportunities that come along? I realized my inner desires to want to be a humanitarian and help others out.  I though getting a job in the healthcare industry might not be a bad idea because my work would be toward a good cause and something that I care about instead of some pointless work like i-banking or marketing for some company."
130,"I'm sorry, I don't write english well, but I will try to explain my situation...I asked the I Ching a question about a girl I love and I have lost... for my haste.She just sees me as a friend, now.I asked how to get close to her again and the answer has been 46,no moving lines.I think It's a good answer, even if a great effort and a long time is needed,but the success is granted.What do you think about?Thank you"
131,"Hi All,I just put up another post introducing myself as a new member and asking a question about my love life I have another question I asked the I Ching this morning and am hoping to get some advice about it.  The question is, where should I move to?  The I Ching responded with The Abysmal 29.1.2.4 --> 17 Following.  I moved to D.C. about 8 months ago and have had a feeling the entire time that I chose the wrong place.  I've really given it a chance - have met new people and tried to establish a community - but just can't escape the feeling I'm in the wrong part of the country.  Nothing seems to click here for me, even though I've got friends nearby.  The city feels hollow and transient to me.  (I've lived in many parts of the country and didn't feel this way, so that's why I think it's specific to here).  There's a workaholic/happy hour type lifestyle here that doesn't suit me anymore...I used to jive with that kind of vibe but now am realizing I want to pursue more artistic pursuits and work in an environment that challenges me but doesn't stress me out so much I feel overwhelmed.  Any thoughts on the I Ching's advice?"
132,"Man in question sent me birthday wishes by email and I phoned him to say thank you and tell him the asnwer to his question about my foot surgery.When I phoned he had a lot of people over, said he would phone me back the next day. He didnt. i waited five days and called him. I asked how his  party had been. He said it was impromptu, he had dinner with friends and then invited them over and it lasted til 6 in the morning and it was fun, and sorry he didnt phone me back but by the time he finishes work and thinks to phone me it is too late to call. (excuse).We had a 40 minute conversation about this and that. He had previously (before my bday) agreed to attend my party on the 19th. On the 16th when we spoke i told him about parking for the 19th party, and we talked about his work and my work and my foot and his international project and etc. it was a warm, casual convo. I didnt have the sense he wanted to get off the phone.On the 19th, he sent a text saying smthing went wrong in the lab, he could not leave, he is sorry to miss my party. I replied saying well we will be here til late if you want to come later. I was very disappointed. I had planned the party for weeks with the hope of him meeting my friends.Stupidly I phoned the next day. I actually phoned not to talk about my party but to tell him i had feelings for him. I planned/wrote out a speech... i didnt get to say it bc he had to go immediately, bc he normally makes a phonecall overseas to his family at that time each Sunday & it was already late where they are. He said he would ph one back and never did.I decided the worst thing I can do now is tell him how i feel. Bc i have been misreading signals all along.I had thought after two flower deliveries from him (3 weeks ago) and more attention out of the blue he was interested. I now believe I was just reading ito it what i wanted. I have struggled with this (as many of you on the forum know) and I do not know what i am doing wrong. I am trying to guess the rules of the game, but they are not written anywhere.  I thought it would be OK to call and treat him like a friend, but the calling has pushed him away (even tho it was only 2 calls). I have never just phoned a guy out of the blue like this and was nervous as heck, my heart POUNDING when I dialed the number. But previous readings had suggested he is scared or shy and doesnt know i'm interested adn to make it safer i should do something to bridge the gap. I thought building a friendship with a convo would help. Now that seems to have been wrong.Why didn’t he come to the party? 15 integrity twice.What is my best plan of action to him now? 13.6 > 49What is this? 13 line 6?? The companions trust one another, even when they are far apart. But the fact that the beloved is in a distant place means that the association is still not fulfilled; the time of true brotherhood of man has not yet arrived. But there is hope and no occasion for reproach. He doenst seem to trust me or even like me. He didnt come to my party. He has not returned a call --twice. People keep telling me he is interested but scared. I think i'm the stupid one here now.  ""there is hope""? really? Where? Where is the hope?Another interpretation: ""The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We are by this time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we ally ourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only those who happen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at the entrance to the town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union of mankind has not yet been attained, but we need not reproach ourselves. We join the community without separate aims of our own.""OK no attachment of the heart on his end? Clear. But there is one on mine. It is telling me how it is, not what to do...I found this on another thread: ""13.6 You meet the guest speaker 'out in the field.' That is, not in your own home or place. That part just means the meeting is outside your home. Some translators have added the idea that the person is also 'remote' because he is on a mission; like a soldier fighting a war. He is dedicated to his mission and it is not likely that you'll get close to him -- or as close to him as you wanted to get.""  Ok my party was outside of my home, and he would not have known anyone there. but i am not asking what happened that night I want to know how to cope going forward.It continues: ""I have had this line simply when meeting a friend somewhere. Something might be disappointing -- but not always. Once I thought the friendship would go on and on but my friend told me she was leaving for another city. That was disappointing. In any case, the advice is not to be sad. ""But i am sad. He is (my ""he"" in this case) dedicated to his work and i guess i cant be close to him for that reason? is this the message?Also: ""And in the spirit line, 13.6, it is good to stay in the meadow, don't expect everyone to be of the same level. Some change like leopards, others only in the face (49.6). If you limit your exchange to your own level, nothing new or unexpected can meet you, no possibility to grow, to expand your horizon.""""What is that, ""to your own level""? I met this man precisely by expaning my horizons, going to a party last summer where I did not know a single soul. I now want to meet this man on any level he so chooses, wither it is intellectual conversations about international situations or doing archery on the weekends (both of which we've done)... And nothing happens.. and my heart is breaking in two.Also:  ""People in the ""countryside"" appear all the same outwardly but inwardly they are not. To accept this in close relationships is very difficult since we want to be inwardly close as well. I got this line when asking about exactly this to someone I am very close outwardly (I am married to her for 18 years) but feel inwardly quite incompatible for a long time, hence not enough intimacy to feel really content. Unfortunately, this is not going away. So I get regularly frustrated and ask the IGing what the root cause of my frustration was and got 13.6. Should I be worried about this? The IGing says that I shouldn't - no regrets! I find this quite difficult to stomach. It also says that things are quite not yet as they should be! What does that mean? Well, the resulting 49 gives a hint - things need to change quite a bit! But where and how? It seems that the IGing gives a good analysis of the socical circumstances but hasn't got an answer either! Does it mean the their are things in our life we just have to accept? Acceptance of the ""normality"" of the power of convenience - is that the dramatic change? Is that all?""My questions exactly. I would love input."
133,"hello, I have asked to the IC what about beginning a new project of job.I'm a little bit doubtful about opening my own shop.The answer was hex 36.1>15.I don't know how interpret this in this case, in the business world.Could you help please?Thank you."
134,"Hi all, A little background of myself:Having lived and worked overseas for more than 10 years, I decided it's time for me to go back to my home country and seek better personal growth and also financial opportunities (in business). Unfortunately, I've been struggling over the past year and a half (maybe not that surprising given the 10 year disconnect) trying to find the progress that I'm looking for but to no avail. Being stuck causes me a great deal of stress and also the remorse of coming back to this country.To cut the story short, a wealthy relative ""S"", who definitely has the resources and capacity to help but he seems unsympathetic to my situation (although I don't really want his sympathy). I never thought I would go this route but desperate times call for desperate measures and thus I'm thinking of asking him for his help. One day I visited him and we chatted a bit and he seemed more open but still very much reserved when I asked if it's possible for him to be my mentor. Giving no definite answer, I decided not to press for more than I should. After that event, I asked IC:What do I need to understand about the outcome of today's meeting with ""S""?Hex 1.3.4.6 > 60. It sounds quite positive except the line 6, which I don't recall I went overboard at anytime during the meeting.Remembering his slightly more open attitude, I asked Is S ready to help me to obtain some progress?Hex 58.2.6 > 25. Hex 58 is usually about communication? Is it suggesting I have another talk with S?Building on the previous reading, I asked What should I think about doing in order to allow S to help me?Hex 19.1.2.6 > 23. Hex 19 seems to suggest that I approach him again (similar to hex 58?) but I couldn't make anything out of the individual lines.Any insights or comments will be greatly appreciated.ThanksVince"
135,"Hi everyone,It is the first time I am posting here, I just joined this site. I am glad it exists. I hope one or some of you can help me interpreting a reading. Context:My nephew who I love very much had a serious psychotic episode (possibly schizophrenia, not diagnosed yet). His mom, my middle sister (I am the youngest), was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She lives in a very small Brazilian town far away from the capital, where there is no proper treatment for them. He was supposed to be taking medicines but last week I found out that she was neglecting the due attention and he was throwing the medicine away. I now live in Canada, and am months away from finishing my PhD, a project that I invested years of my life on. I can't go there right now without jeopardizing this project. My family back in Brazil - my dad, mom and older sister (we're 3) - seem to be in a strange state of denial. Nobody has gone to talk to the psychiatrist who is treating them both. They say that despite her mental illness she is an adult, and can take care of herself and her son. Her life story and current behavior says otherwise. I told my family I was extremely concerned and would like at least one to try understanding their conditions and assessing if they should consider moving to the capital to get proper psychotherapy treatment, besides the chemical medication. They are adamant it is not necessary and I should take care of my own life. They think I am, from far away, accusing the whole family of neglect. I am genuinely concerned, afraid that so far away and without proper treatment a very bad thing can happen to one of them or to both. The Question:I asked if I should insist trying to convince my older sister (parents are old and stubborn) to do what I am confident is the right thing: to talk to their psychiatrist in order to understand the whole picture and how to better help my middle sister and my nephew. Hexagram was 43.2. I interpret it is telling me to go ahead, to speak out my own conviction (43). What I don't get is if line 2 is telling me to prepare for the worst, or giving me hope. Could resulting hexagram 49 mean here that they will believe (listen to) me eventually and this can avoid disaster? Or that a big and painful revolution is on its way and I should prepare myself?I would truly appreciate an outside insight on this one. Pagu"
136,"Some time ago, when I used to post here regularly, I asked for help with various aspects of a life that was slowly sliding downhill:  lack of a stable place to live [still the case]; inability to sell a house in a foreign country that is draining resources and emotion [still the case]; working in a place where there is tension and family conflict but also a lot of promise and room for creativity [still the case].    One thing changed this Winter in that I had to move to a very difficiult place to live on a mountaintop.  The house I was in sold and this was the only thing available in the area.  Hiking out in subzero weather nearly a mile to where my car is parked resulted in several bad falls in snow and ice, broken ribs and a bruised spine, and that has ultimately caused further serious illness, something for which there is no obvious cure nor limit.It's been a long cold Winter and I've ended up ill in this remote house.  I lie here, pray, meditate, try to think what there is to learn from all of this.  It's just gradually, inexorably, taken hold.  That kind of slide you can see happening and you know, sooner or later, you're going to hit hard.  Then you bounce and hit hard again, and again.  The tangible fall eventually followed the abstract one that had been happening for a couple years.  At first, I thought I wouldn't sustain much damage - physical or psychological, that I was succeeding in toughing it out. But the truth is home to roost and here I am staring at the ceiling when I'm not nauseated, in pain, or conferring with the doctor and accupuncturist.  On the bright side, I still have a job although my income is badly suffering from this illness.  I've kept up some work on computer from bed.  Although my family squabbles like mad at the company they are a good family on the whole and I'm lucky to have them and fortunate that they continue to employ me, although on a more limited basis.  My health is somewhat fragile anyway, but I have high hopes of beating off this current illness, and also hope it won't leave any lasting disability.  Friends have stayed in touch and I know those who believe it matters are praying for my recovery. I'm not out, just flattened a bit.Enough explanation, time for the casting.  I asked the question -- How much further on this road until I begin to recover? I wasn't asking a time, so much as for an indication of where I am in this nebulous and prolonged process.  And, just a note, when I ask that I'm asking about physical recovery of course, but that in connection with a tangible recovery on the various fronts of general stability, finances, work and the emotional drain that has been never ending.  Because throughout these several chaotic years, one thing has seemed to mirror all the others.  Mirrors within mirrors.The answer:  55.1.4 becoming 15.  My immediate reaction to Line one is that this situation has peaked, it won't get worse anyway.  Line four seems to tell me, just go with the flow, that I can't change the situation, it will change in its own good time.  Not what I was hoping for exactly.  But Hex 15 sounds like coming to terms with it all, reaching level ground where there is something to rely upon anyway, and that maybe I can find a purpose in this somewhere.  Not a reason most likely, but at least something worth learning.I leave it open to Clarity friends to comment from there.Last edited: Jan 30, 2011"
137,"hello, What IC tell my about a friend, it's a long time ago since I don't see her, I asked if she wanted to see me again. She suddenly dissapeared and I think something hurted her, i don't know exactly.she is very proud. I've tried to speak to her but, I was rejected.IC answer 2 line 6>8I interpret that although she doesn't evidence to another friends, she wants to see me again and speak about.I think she wants to be my friend again.Thanks."
138,"hello everyone, I received this hexagram when I was asking if I must stop seeing my friends, stop going out with them.The cuestion is that I have a lot of complex about me, I think I'm not funny, I can not provide nothing to me friends, to face this situation everytime I'm with them is very stressing for me and I lose a lot of energy, I feel very bad with myself. I think I'm a disaster in everything, in love, in relatioships.So I thought maybe avoiding these situations I could find some peace, although I think this is not the most recommended for me.So IC answered with hexagram 50 no changing lines. Thank you for your contributions."
139,"So there is this person who was my best friend. Misunderstandings happened blah blah and we haven't been speaking for almost a year. Now I look back and think we were both gong through so much BS and took it out on one another. We've been through worse and supported each other. Anyway, I asked the I Ching of I should write her and try to reconcile our friendship. It answered 42.1.6 to 8.Both hexagrams look great along with the first changing line.Increase/Prospering and Union. But the 6th line is not so great. ""Someone beating him"". Yeah, so I'm a little confused. I also vaguely remember reading somewhere here that if the first and last line changes it means that the initial hexagram is more potent or something and therefore one should just look at the relating and not the changing lines. Is that true?Thanks!"
140,"Hi all,I have been trying to interpret my own readings. And this one I want to seek some perspectives from other.  My bf is extremely close this girl lately, which he said she's just a good friend of his. And he told me she's only 20 and he's 34 (so he thinks this is a good reason for me to believe there is nothing going on between them). But I am still not 100% persuaded. I asked iching ""if my bf has feelings for this girl"". I got 60.3 to 5. My own interpretion is my bf didn't set the boundary on whats right thing for him to do, so it seems like the answer is suggesting yes. And hex 5 is telling me to wait to see everything to be unfold. Anyone can give some thought, or at least tell me if my interpretion is correct or not? Thanks"
141,Sorry I know my question makes hard to interpret the result. Could anyone tell me the iching is saying yes or no? Please!
142,"So, I have a problem with worry. I asked the i ching 'How do I completely stop worrying?' and got hexagram 16, lines 5 and 6 changing to hexagram 12. I have a tendency to worry about everything, but the bulk of my worry is with one particular thing at the moment which I won't get into. I know it's irrational worry, I know that my perception of how bad things are is out of line with how things really are. The i ching has told me numerous times that I don't have to worry about this particular thing, that things are not that bad, it just requires waiting and I'm too harsh on myself. I actually think that worrying is my way of feeling like I'm in control of uncontrollable situations. I hate not being in control, I love the idea of being able to go with the flow, being spontaneous and not imagining outcomes, but I find it very hard to put into practice. I've tried many times before to stop worrying, and I do ok for a couple of days, and then I circle back into it somehow. I think because I tend to doubt myself a lot, even when things are actually ok. I see 16 line 5 as reflecting the illness of worrying too much, and how difficult it is for me to stop. I see line 6 saying that if I just do it, stop worrying, perhaps realise how bad it is for me and stop letting it go on and on, to have some willpower and just break from it already. I know I can do it, I think a lot of my problem is that I think of the future and outcomes a lot, rather than just living the present. I worry about how to achieve things, question if I'm able to etc. I guess my worry is more overanalysing than mere worry that's just a concern. I mean sometimes analysing things achieves something but a lot of the time it gets me nowhere. I think the overall advice is that it's not going to be easy to stop worrying, but it's very necessary for me to. I think it's quite a chronic thing with me, but if I can change and turn myself away from it then I will be better for it. I actually feel like I'm truly fed up with myself this time so maybe I can learn to worry less and shut my brain up for a while? Any thoughts on my reading? I'm guessing that I'll probably still worry about things, as we all do, some worry is normal. But I guess what I'm wanting to stop is my tendency to worry irrationally and to doubt myself and think negatively. I guess I would like some more advice from the i ching on how to stop, but I think I do know how, I just wish it were as easy as flicking off a switch. I suppose it's not as hard as I perceive it to be. I think it's a matter of recognising in myself if I do start to worry needlessly, and to pull myself out of it, to not let it go on too long. There's also the need to be content with not knowing things, with things being up in the air, just letting things be or work themselves out rather than worrying over it or pushing to figure it all out now. Any other ideas about these lines?"
143,"What could I do to improve chances at Z company?  Hex 63.4 to 4963.4 says The finest clothes turn to rags. Be careful all day long. Hexagram 49 says Revolution.I take the overall message as a warning or something of decadence is involved, and not to expect anything great.  The image that hexagram 63.4 paints is a negative one almost warning me of something or decadence, and 49 hints at the idea that I might need to do something big in order to get the job.  If someone could clarify this or correct me in my analysis I would appreciate it."

He always came across as a demanding, driven man and working as his direct assistant would certainly be  a challenge. I asked the Yi:How would it be to work with X? Hex 7.2 ->2Seems to me that maybe I would be taking a central position in the company, through discipline and strong organizing I would be accepted in my role as his assistant. But i would like to understand better how this hex would apply to my question, how it would be to work with him.Any input would be welcome! :bows:"

So, yes I am clean and sober, I have been attending the Tibetan Bon Buddhist Temple here in Pittsburgh and recovery again. I'm meditating and taking a very scary and hard look at ME again  I've been doing some deep, deep, deep healing as of late. Perhaps when one is in emotional and spiritual upheaval it's best not to consult the Yi??????I'm at a point now in my life where my father is dying and I'm new again to being clean and folks I'm plain terrified. Before consulting the Yi, I've meditated on ""where and what to do next"". What path should I follow? I don't have any answers. I feel I'm lost. A friend of mine suggested going to massage therapy school....hmmmmm. So I've contemplated it and am still at a loss. I consulted Yi and frankly don't understand the answer.

Yet 14 is about possessing something good, and the lines are good, and 55 is positive in the moment, it's just LATER that the potential exists for it to go south.What do you wise people think?"
158,"HelloNot an easy ride by any means at the moment - and am feeling the underlying expectation from myself and people around me to start making choices about what next.  Because i am so anxious to get it right I realised that when I felt good about an idea to follow I got all anxious about checking it out with the I Ching in case it gave me a warning against the action - but I know from past readings its important to choose wisely at this stage.I asked the I Ching for insight into our relationship as I felt this anxiety is not a good foundation - not trusting myself fully - or, the I Ching in that case I suppose, and if it gave a warning against something I felt good about, then it would be a setback against my learning to feel empowered myself at this very difficult time.  does that make sense? It gave me 7:1 and 4 leading to 54.I could take 7:4 as an opportunity to retreat from the I Ching for a bit and just trust myself - or it could be referring to the situation that I am wanting/not wanting to enquire about.  From the readings in the forum it suggests that this is also about self empowerment - but I would appreciate any insight if you have any?thanks, Hebe"
159,"Hi there!there is a guy in my life , he has been there for more than 3 years now, who I would define a friend. I define him a friend as I like him, and I actually like him more than for a friend, but when I told him that I did, 2.5 years ago, he reacted in a strange way, as he told me that now he has a girlfriend, who has the same hair like me. ( ???) He never told me, ""for me you 're just a friend""He stayed together with this girl, who from the character point of view, is completely the opposite of me, and he kept on calling me from time to time, going out as friends, always only the two of us.( I knew her, and just respected the fact they were together by not calling and looking for him) Having a good chat and catching up every couple of months. Last september they broke up, and called me up, by saying that he should have seen what kind of ambitions she had with him etc. He was glad to have broken up with her, as she did not sustain him in his professional ambitions, according to him. After that, I told him that I did not want this role anymore, that I did not agree to be there for him, only when he needs to talk, and that either he put some more effort in this relationship with me or I would rather prefer that we let it both go.I still like him and find him attractive, more than what I can find a friend attractive.( I did not re-mention that to him though) I must say, at this stage, that I am quite an independent person, who has been single for quite a long time, and he knows that very well.After I told him that, he started calling me more often, asks me more often how I am, wants to see me and asks me out more often. Kind of weird, but I accept it and would like to know what he wants from me. Honestly this does not look like normal friendship to me.By asking the IC I got the 32.2.3.5 > 45 response, and I interpret it as that I have to let the situation go, 2nd line look where it leads me to, 32, and that he is kind of unstable in his needs,  (3rd line)What about the 5th line? And, what do you think of the final Hex, and generally speaking, what could you say to the whole IC interpretation I am giving to this?Thank you for your comments.cheers,lindorita"
160,Hey guys!So the economy sucks and I am looking for something outside my field to supplement my income. The thing is it's a commission based job in rental real estate but it seems like a very progressive company. So I asked if this is correct place for me and got Hexagram 24.1 changing to 2. Then I asked what to expect If I work with them and if I'll be able to generate good income and got Hexagram 48. So is this a nudge from the I Ching to go for it??
161,"Hello,I joined  a few years ago and I am back to ask the experts here some advice once again.To make a long story short, I had a wonderful, attraction at first sight relationship. Been going on since October. It is very mutual and we have everything under the sun in common.Two nights ago I did something to mess it up. ( I am female by the way)Nothing bad as in breaking a trust or anything like that. It is complicated and I cannot explain it.Anyway, I did a few readings with different questions. Although there was some obstacles to overcome in the readings they seemed  positive but I don't know about this one here so I will start with this one here.My question was: How Do I Fix My Situation With _____?I got Hex 10: Lines 2,4,5,6 and changing to Hex 24.Note: I had Hex 24 Return in a relationship there years ago and we did in fact reconcile. ( we are still great friends by the way)Thank you."
162,"i can't go into a lot of details about this, but I am trying to step back from, even possibly end a friendship with someone. I have the feeling (from a few things they have said in the past) that they will keep pestering me.I asked yi if this person will leave me alone and got 27.4.6>51 as my response.Then as a follow up to that response, because I was still a bit confused, I asked if they would chase after me?62.3.5>45 was the answer to that question.Um, okay, my initial take on the first answer was possessiveness and an appetite that they see me as satiating. Then I looked at the lines again and wondered if maybe I was reading them wrong way. Perhaps this person was looking for other sources of nourishment elsewhere (line 4) and were able to ""feed"" themselves (line 6). That's when I did the second reading, for clarification.Line 3 sounds like I need to watch my step or else I could end up in a bad situation. Not sure how this applies because this person is not a deranged stalker or violent. I just want some space following an argument and they keep messaging me. Maybe it is telling me not to overreact? Or like something will catch me off guard?Line 5 sounds like the present situation....this person attempting to get me to come back and resume the friendship.We have a lot of friends in common, so hexagram 45 could point to that environment we are mutually bound to. Maybe they will attempt to contact me through a social networking site and that's what the 45 is about? Not sure.The line 3 in the second reading bothers me and I am still not quite sure how to read the first answer.Can anyone help me?NamasteLast edited: Feb 20, 2011"
163,"Hi  Everyone    Whenever I ask I Ching a question about someone that has passed on, I always get the first hexagram 36..Darkening of the light or Hiding Brightness..(i use those translations) It usually has moving lines so a second hexagram developes.

Gotten hexagram 4-unchanged...I have read somewhere that hexagrams should be interpreted literaly if possible...but this seams it is just a learning experiance for him-nothing serious comes out of it?And asking about someone else...I was not very cool at the time...Anyway, I-ching is a generous in its nature so can anyone share how hex 4 relates to an possible relationship?

169,"Hello everyone!Just a little background information. I am currently in a stage in my life where it appears to be time for me to deal with my trust issues. I've always had difficulty in trusting people in general but things seem to get out of hand when it comes to ...men and romance! I have been in a therapeutic process for the past few years and done a lot of personal progress. I am usually quite self aware and most of the time i find it easy to recognize my emotions as well as their cause. However this difficulty in trusting is always there and i cannot seem to be able to decode it. It seems to be a core issue but no matter how hard i look i cannot find any major traumas or abandonment issues in my early childhood, nothing as clear as that..Anyway, at this point in my life ( soon to be 30) I have this deep need to break free from all this fear and mistrust and move on.. But in order to do so I feel i need to finally look myself in the eyes and ask what it is that i am so afraid of..So yesterday, I decided to ask the Yi about it.. The question was : "" What lies beneath my difficulty in trusting?""Answer: 53.2.4.5.6>32Too many changing lines usually discourage me.. The general feeling of it is beautifull. I think it says to just keep going, working on it step by step and i'll finally get there.. Trust and commitment seem to be central in both hexes.. I find the answer reassuring but I am still left with a feeling of not completely getting it. I hardly got any sleep last night as the hexagrams, the images, the lines, the text, kept popping in my mind. There's a feeling of importance about this particular reading. Like there's more to it than "" Don't worry. You're doing fine"".So i decided to post it here! I would love to hear of any insight or even general thoughts about it!Thank you all!"

I don't know whether what i said may have been misinterpreted and I don't know whether my friend is angry/sad/or just plain selfish.Today I asked should I be prepared to wait for a long time before we can talk or meet to solve this?And drew 38 changing to 40 (I believe it is line 1 and 6 changing.Confused, at the end of the day I asked: should I just let go of the whole situation and leave them to it?

172,"Is this relationship over? Hex51 to 24Hi! I'm kind of new in I Ching, but since i'm experiencing this strange, depressive and confusing time in my life, i searched for answers in I Ching and most of the time, they seem easy to interpretate.But the most painful questions are also the more confusing ones to interpretate and please, give me a help, i'd apreciate it so deeply.I finally answered if my relationship with my boyfriend is over. Please understand, we live together, he's the most kind and sweet man i could ever imagine and it used to make to me the happiest woman on Earth. So, i don't have any reason to leave him, except for the fact that i feel miserably unhappy for about 2 months.The answer was hex51, changing to 24. What does this mean? That is over? That some how, this is not the man of my life?Thank you in advance for any attention you pay to this.Last edited: Feb 17, 2011"
173,"I deal with anxiety... a lot. I'm a worrier and I know that it causes problems with my relationships. So I asked the Yi ""why do I get so anxious in relationships?"" The response was 6.6 > 47.This appears to fit my situation perfectly. There's always a certain point in any relationship I've ever had that I begin to become very anxious and worry about how things are going, where they're headed, etc. It always makes me think there's something wrong. This, then leads to me not being myself as I'm always trying to figure out what's wrong. For some time now I've thought maybe I'm just cursed... and I'm just going to have to live with the fact that none of my relations will ever work out. But, looking at 6.6 it seems that maybe my real problem is that I always try to be right. To get my way no matter what. It always seems to stem from fear. Fear of being rejected, fear of being alone.  It always starts the same way. Some little influence or thought pops into my head that says ""something's wrong. Something's not going the way it should."" And from that point on it's lights out for the real me. So maybe I'm creating the problems by focusing on them, even if they aren't really there.Now the question is. How do I break the cycle?"
174,"HeyI've been a really stressful situation for a while now (a few years) and seeing that I saw no way of ending it, don't wanna get too much into details but I asked what was stopping me from having a positive ending in this situation and got 33.4.5 > 52, which to me meant that I wasn't stepping away from a certain situation and that was exactly what was stopping me.Anyways I asked ""What situation was the last reading referring to?"" and got Hex 3 unchanging, now I don't really understand how a new beginning might apply to an old situation or how does Hex 3 fit in the whole ""situation to get away from"" scheme.Can anyone please help me understand this one, the situation's very important to me.Thanx"

181,"Hi everyone,One more love crisis lead me to a new point of clarity. I brought myself again into an all-too-familiar scenario. I was gradually building proximity with someone, opening, allowing trust and somehow at the point I give my heart and compromise to the feeling, the guy unexplainably went away, disappears, no contact. This has happened before, same same. I was in the blank for the last weeks. Sent him a couple of emails, no response. Nobody knew where he was, me worried ill. That desolating deja-vu of absurdity, not-knowing, and abandonment. Yesterday he wrote back. superficially, suggesting he doesn't have to pay any explanation to ""acquaintances"" (german Bekannte, I don't really know the English word, someone one just knows…). He is dry, and short, and clearly lets me know between the lines how emotionally irrelevant he wants me to feel. The sub-text is ""look how unimportant you are to me and how much I don't need you"".It worked. I felt that small.I cried all night but, at some point, watching my angry thoughts, having an imaginary conversation with him in witch I let him know how despicable of a person I think he is, opportunist and self-centred, using others socially merely for their artistic status (I feel used, like he hanged out with me because im known in our circle of artists). Most of all, angry at his independence, his autonomy, how much he doesn't need anyone and just takes off. Really enraged. Too enraged… … I had to realise the exaggerated anger could only mean he is showing me a part of me I disowned. I ve been through this in life, and I believe when a trait in someone moves you that much, it s not just about them. Hey, this guy is no saint - but why am I so concerned…? Because Im just like him, in a way. And I envy the autonomy and independence I project on to him. And these are mine. I just disowned them and give them away to this recurrent figure in a form of a possible love partner, to whom I get attached like a disease. Like my identity depended on it. I asked: How can I claim back this healthy power and centeredness I project on to these men, releasing them from such a charged dynamics (and retrieving my power back!!!)?49 (1,4,5) 15I found 49 revolution and change of government a super response to this question. It is really about a generalyzed new attitude - and power and governments. 49 for me captures perfectly the spirit of the issue, and 15 is then an advice on my personal compusure. To be sincere with myself, and give away megalomanias of dominance and control. Simplicity.But the lines I cant grasp. And I wish to now specifically what I could do, in clearer, less abstract terms. The lines just suggest I really change, as deep as in a new skin - but how? I have no clues whether I should really face these sort of men and confront my dark self in the face, or run from them as the devil from the cross. Also line 1 disencourages action, and the other lines seem to instigate immediate undertakings...can you guys help?Thank you.:bows:yoana"

Time to grow up and stop this in its tracks before it's too late.I figure that if I really need to ask these questions then, y'know things are probably not right...my heart knows.What do you all think of my takes on these 3 readings?

188,"RE: upcoming summer and life changes 62.1.3.6 -> 51Hello!I am in the middle of a few divinations with different mediums (I-ching, Tarot & Runes) in order to find out the best direction for me to take in the upcoming months. I am 21 years old and currently finishing up some pre-reqs for university music programs in larger cities than where I am now. What I am going to do for the 4 months in between schools is a big question right now.I have for a long time wanted to go away on a solitary retreat to work on my music, record, investigate my personal spirituality, read, write, etc etc...all the things young artists want to do to figure themselves out. I have been thinking of undertaking this this summer but I have been wondering how. Yesterday I thought I came up with the solution which was to go away for May and the first half of June somewhere quiet and work on these things, and then come back and work at a YMCA camp I have been working at for the last 2 summers. I know alot of people there and there are numerous benefits. It all made sense in my mind and then I asked for clarification/verification.What came was not what I expected. I pulled one Tarot card, The Tower, which had shown up in a previous reading about the summer in the future position. I hadn't thought too much of it then but yesterday was different. I decided to consult different mediums to get a bigger picture. The runes definitely outline some kind of Towerlike phenomena, being an intense change that is largely unbidden or precipitated but ultimately necessary for growth. Since this is an I-Ching forum though, I'd like to hear your thoughts about the 62-51 throw.To me, this all seems very ominous. I have been blessed all my life with excellent fortune in all matters. I consider myself very lucky. To have a portent of large, potentially painful and sweeping change seems intense and uncharacteristic for me. I am a bit worried actually. I wonder if you have any thoughts...?Thanks."

190,"godessliss and I seem to be on a similar timetable for lovelife.I asked ""what can I do to clear the way for love to come into my life"" and got:27.3.5 > 37And as soon as I asked it my mind was filled with anxious questions, should I even be looking for love right now, isnt that too much to expect, I should just be trying to meet new people and have a good time.... etc. so I kind of feel like I shouldn't have asked this question.I read some threads on this combo and from them and my own experience 37 isn't really something for a love connection but rather a basis for a love connection to be built upon, and that being close ties, close friendship but with the emphasis of people who you stick with a work together with. Which in my opinion is the stuff lasting relationships are about, I've yet to experience one but have always seen this in others. but the lines of 27, I should watch what I crave for? line 3...maybe points to my love life up until now, there is  lot going on for me at the moment and one thing is a major shift in a friendship of mine with a man who, when I finally was honest with myself, I had been in love with for 10 years. oi, line 5 has differences in interpretations, I'm hoping its telling me to decide for myself what I need to nourish me. hmmmm, the backdrop is I have become increasingly , seriously interested in mr. 25 > 35 but am sort of expecting the worst."

195,"There was a man in my life last fall, and sparks flew between us during a rather strong celestial positioning, afterwards cooling down. I have tried very hard to stay in touch with him bc I beleived there's something there, and I still do. I had a foot operation last week and out of the blue he showed up with flowers, a very high tech plug-in automatic ice pack (which is WAY better than trying to hold a bag of frozen peas on your foot!) made me tea, chatted for 2 hours. Two days later came with MORE flowers, brought me lunch,  more ice, refilled the ice pack machine, took out my garbage, fixed tea again, hung around again for 2 hours. Because we do not see each other frequently and in fact I had not seen him since mid October-- to me this was huge.(we had emailed in December but all of that was my initiative)I thanked him in person for the flowers and sent a message later by text. In return he wrote ""that's what friends are for."" I got very upset bc i thought, at first, well, obviously i read way too much into this. Flowers mean nothing. We're only friends, period. But my own friends have pointed out that what else was he to say, ""thats what lovers are for?"" Because there's been no romance between us. Yet. Some people say a man doesnt drive one hour each way with flowers etc just to ""be nice"" and certainly not twice in a row. I have no idea if that's true or not.I have several options about how to proceed. I want to cultivate a closer friendship and i would dream of a relationship with him. But i cannot seem to be able to get out of some weird (probably also celestial?) blockage. We have electric conversations, no odd pauses, tons to talk about. I feel physical chemistry personally (do not know if he does).I think he might but i think he is gun shy. I know he's been hurt in the past. This step to me in a way seems huge. But how can i keep things rolling?I have recieved advice from several very trusted friends and they are tellnig me I need to treat this more casually, not clam up and freeze. When I think a guy is courting me i do freeze bc i do not want to be too clingy or suffocate them, which i have done in the past. So now, i do nothing. I am polite and i receive but i dont interact as much as I would, say, for a girlfriend, saying let's go out to coffee, want to see this movie etc. Bc in my silly head that's the ""man's role"" -- to court.SO I asked the Yi for advice on how to best proceed. I am trying to interpret these results in terms of what *is* best to do at this point. I do not want to lose this chance -- this man stepped way out for me, he went to a lot of trouble, spent a lot of time and money. I want to show him i appreciate it but i fail when it comes to anything but words (and for now i have no use of my foot so i cannot, for example, make a cake and go visit him -- i cant leave my apartment for another few weeks). What if I call and chat and invite him casually to stop by sometime this week?12.5 > 23. (Blocked and Stripping Away )Initially I thought this was a highly negative reading advising me against doing this. But the more I read about it, sounds like line 5 actually encourages you to do this, be aware that it can fail but that by risking the failure things progress (if i didnt just confuse hexes here).What if i only call and chat (no invitation ie no pressure)?  22.1.2.6 > 46 Pushing upwardLine 6, ""simplicity is all"" -- that encourages this plan. Ie keep it simple (but keep in contact).What if i do not phone today? 20.3 and 53 Line 3 is reflection, suggests it might be OK. I dont see anything ""bad"" in not phoning today. (line 3 is the point of transition. It is no longer sufficient to observe the world with the innocent eyes of the child or from a self-centred point of view. One must strive to acquire objectivity by looking inward and observing one’s feelings and emotions. Learning from these, one begins to plan the future development of one’s life.)What effort do I need to make to help things continue to get better?40Release lines 3,4 > hex 46Not clear to me -- L3 ‘Shouldering a burden while also riding in a carriageInvites the arrival of bandits. Constancy, shame.’ (what is this bad? I was asking what to do but it seems to suggest bad luck without saying what is bad)Line 4= ‘Releasing the thumbs also. Partners arrive, hence truth and confidence.’Partnering is good (??)"

197,"Was the girl checking me out?Hexagram 21.1.3.4.6 to Hexagram 15....? (Bitting Through to Modesty)Line 6 really bothers me...it says Deaf to Good Counsel. His ears are gone.  Does that mean she tried to say something to me, but I missed something because I thought I was picking up on everything subtle. (I have hearing loss so maybe I missed something she could have said even though we didnt speak)The Event:Story goes I was trying to get a glance at her while she was sitting on the bench but some big dude was my way blocking my view.  As Im getting on the bus the big guy is in front of me and the girl is by my side.  The big dude tells the girl ""go ahead"" and she responds ""no, its okay, you go"".  But he insists so she goes ahead.  Then he completely block my entire bus ride from her.  So in the context of Hexagram 21 Im assuming he screwed up my plans to talk to her or maybe I screwed them up.Last edited: Feb 9, 2011"
198,"Hi:   As I had a feeling that my current employment could end soon, I consulted the Oracle on Tuesday, asking:  how can I gain a new source of income that matches, or even exceeds, my current salary ?    I received Hexagram # 62, 'Small Exceeding' changing to # 2 'Earth'.    My understanding is that the Oracle is advising that it may be best to avoid initiating any significant changes at this time and to be very cautious. Keep a low profile & concentrate on the job at hand. Lines 3 & 4 seem to indicate possible negative results, and, again, to be very careful.     What is the significance of the resulting Hexagram #2 in relation to my question?     I would very much appreciate your help with this reading.     (The day after the reading, my departmental manager hinted to me that I might not be a good match to my current job & department.)      Thank you for your kind attention.Last edited: Jan 15, 2011"
199,"Hello,this is one of many posts about a possible relationship with a man who is/has been very hard to read (see old posts..).there is something about this connection that has been very powerful and positive (he has been a very strong catalyst for positive change in my life) and yet the circumstances are such that we are kept apart (for those who don't know, he's the 'third party', I'm in a not very happy relationship) and his behaviour has been contradictive (on, off)/. A few recent readings had pointed to the fact that he's scared of the situation, and that I was better off just waiting (hex 5 changing to 48). So I made up my mind to just let go, and positively wait, and he reappeared, but still fairly vague.I'm confused but still hanging on to the positive in this connection, a feeling I can't shake.I asked the iching whether he could be falling in love and got 48.6 changing to 57.(this could be positive?)I then asked the iching what are his feelings toward me at the moment and got 36 changing to 26..I see this as he may have very powerful emotions he's hiding, but interested to know anyone else's take on it.thanks!!"

203,"Hi, I have had a series of panic attacks for the past two weeks that seem to be getting worse.I know from past experience that they are related to some sort of emotional pain that I am unwilling to look at or deal with.i did a reading to get a better idea of what the issue could be and the answer I received was hexagram 52 with the 3rd line changing.Repressed heart. The Willhelm translation seems to elude to sexual frustration but i honestly do not see this as the case in my situation.I do have a history of post traumatic stress so the panic attacks could be related to some sort of emotional pain caused by abuse.Can anyone help me see how the reading correlates with this?Thank you in advance for your help."
204,"Hello I'm new to this community and I have already spend some days reading and learning so much!I have a question about a relationship  not original but here goes:I asked about his feelings for an old flame and I got 36 with changing lines 2 and 6. I have trouble understanding this.Second, and this is personal, I have met this person online. Although we have seen eachother in photos I am not sure if he realizes I'm a bit bigger than most girls. We are about to meet and I am so worried how he will feel about the way I look!I got 45 changing lines 4 and 5. I understand 45, but hex 2 leaves me a bit puzzled.Any takes on this?"

206,"My landlord has extended my lease by two weeks, relieving immediate pressure (somewhat) to find a new home.  An opportunity has come up to share a house with someone I knew years ago, however it's not the safest part of town and will involve a commute.   I asked the Yi, if I let this opportunity by will I find a situation more in line with my ideal: living alone, near the water.  Response was 57.4.   'Regrets go away. Catching three kinds of game in the hunt.'  I'm having trouble distinguishing whether regrets would pass if I do take up this opportunity (it's temporary - a couple of months - living with two other people); or is Yi saying that if I pass this up new opportunities, 'game', will be caught?  Overall there does seem to be a sense of 'steady as she goes' and not getting whipped up.There's someone I've known casually for years that I've recently reconnected with who knows I'm looking for a place.   I asked the Yi when/if there would be an appropriate time to approach him about one of the properties he owns - he has several along the water.  While typically very generous of time and advice, I've hesitated to ask directly if he would be willing to lease to me as his properties are beyond my price point. I want to avoid introducing any awkwardness -- he is someone whose respect I value.   Yi's response was 13.2.  Does this suggest I just be open and true about what I'm hoping to find?  Would he respond favorably?  I have always had a hard time asking people for things as I hate to appear needy or worse leave people feeling uncomfortable.  Any feedback is much appreciated."
207,"I got that idea somehow that something would eventually happen.  It seemed kind of ridiculous at first but a couple of things have happened that seem to be saying that I wasn't that far off the mark.  But, it still seems pretty far out and I wanted to see what the Yi thought of my belief that this would happen eventually.What do I need to know about X eventually happening?I got 19.1 -> 7Influence nearing.Constancy, good fortune.That seems rather encouraging.  Is the Yi telling me that my view isn't that nutty after all?  Should I persist in my idea that this will happen eventually?"

In my industry there is a standard rate but because there is no regulations for my feild often employers pay less and so I'm worried. Obviously I'm going to have to bring this up with my new employer but I asked the i ching, ""what do I need to know about this situation"" and got 8.2.3 > 48the 2 hexagrams seem positive but lines 2 & 3 are conflicting, what does this mean?That the personal connection at the time was true but now its not and beware? Maybe I need to just be all business... looking forward to reading any insights or knowledge anyone has on receiving both line 2 & 3 of hex 8"
209,"Hello,I asked the Iching when I would start to feel better and got 24 unchanging as the answer. I'm not sure whether this means November-December (the time of the year this hexagram is associated with), 7 days - which would be nothing short of a miracle - , 7 months, next spring, or does this just mean that recovery would come slowly and gradually like the change of seasons - i.e. it's a matter of time? I'm curious to see what people's experiences are with this hexagram. Thanks!"
210,"I was going through some shared readings...and I wonder what happens if one gets 40.1 into 54? There was a person who never wrote the outcome of his/hers situation...40.1 Release..(and nothing else to do, anyway; be causual ) into 54? And that hexagram, since does not relate to our Western tradition has many wiews, it seams - to many for me to clearly understand what it is that 40 releases its tensions and gets involved (with both hands, grabbing by the horns) into this challenging situation of hex 54? To me it seams as if one is to surrender or simply is in need to do as hex 40 advises but what is then the reward of 54? It doesn`t seam be very promising...does it speaks of only sexual relationship, being overly eager in the situation, being left ""short sleeved""? Would be good to know... and also to what extent should a person think and rethink all possible meanings because people here really can broode over it -it is really easy to get lost in all possible meanings instead of understanding what it actually referes to?May it be that hexagrams can relate to us like objects do in our dreams? Our own relation to each one of them?"

216,"29.1.4.5 > 54this really was not the impression I was trying to make but I asked yi and this was my answer. This is about Mr. 25 > 35 by the way, for anyone who read that thread.54 does make sense as the context, I actually met him through his organisation which the charity I'm volunteering for is going to support. So the setting for attraction was inappropriate, but I really didn't expect him to be so attractive, he was totally different from what I thought he would be , anyway. Also what icastes said in dragonas thread is making me hopeful, that 54 can be:physical passion violating conventional mores.Click to expand...bring it on.I suppose there really isn't much mystery here but I've been exploring 29 lately. Is it plain and simple fear. 18 seems to describe subconscious drives and conditioning. So is 29 your fight or flight reaction. I've also got this picture of it being similar to the chariot in tarot, that sense of courage being commitment despite fear and danger. the lines, 1. his initial reaction was that this is dangerous, line 4 but then he saw a way out line 5 he can move with/past the dangerhmmm. I not very good with my own readings!"
217,"Hello all,I need a little help with this one. I think I know what it means but I would like the insight of others as well, so thanks in advance to all who reply. I asked Yi what I needed to sacrifice in order to for true love to come into my life. I have been divorced for 15 months and was separated before that for 8 months, so 23 all together. I frequently get hex 22 for different questions. Anyhow, I feel strongly for a certain person, but we don't speak. Other than that, I am still having a hard time letting go of my ex-husband of 12 years. We have 2 kids together and he is a very wonderful man. I have struggled with abandonment and rejection issues most of my life due to daddy and peer reasons. I left my ex-husband because I was restless and felt we had grown apart- and yes there was an affair involved. He is still wiling to take me back though and I don't encourage or discourage it. I am having great difficulty committing to the choice to come back or let go. After the affair ended (which I left my ex before I ever started having it, though we were not legally divorced yet), I met someone who I dated for a while but it didn't work out due to the emotional turmoil I had put myself and others through- I wasn't over things, which turned the guy off and then of course I became clinging when he started backing away. Anyhow, I still care about him but he doesn't want to speak to me. He says he needs separation for a good 6-12 months. And again- there is my ex-husband who is a wonderful father and a caring person- who still loves me. I don't feel like I deserve that love though and am having an even harder time wanting it. Despite all this, I am doing a lot better these days emotionally, but I still have my struggles. Today I heard a line on a movie that stated that love is not true without sacrifice, which really hit home. So this is where the question for Yi came from. Yes- it is a loaded situation but I thought a brief background might give further insight."

Always looking at the bright side of life... and now he's gone. He was loved by so many people and he will be missed by all. Nobody seems to know the cause of his sudden passing.

221,"Hello everyone,When I moved into this flat just under a year ago, my upstairs neighbour was as welcoming as can be, before suddenly and without any provocation she started to behave as what can only be described as a bully (stomping and shouting about in the middle of the night, slamming of the doors, leaving her dog outside to bark, and - worst of all! - leaving her wheelie bin outside my kitchen window every Friday, our rubbish collection day, even though - and especially after I asked her to please not do that). She wouldn't speak to me, but has gone straight to our mutual landlord and called me a troublemaker (moi?). The man only wants his rent, so prefers sitting on a fence to taking sides. Besides, they know each other, as she had been living here for 8 years, seeing quite a few families move in and out in the process (and now I understand why).I could move, yes, but there seems to be a pattern long emerging when it comes to creating and enjoying my own home/ personal space (from my mother moving her bed into my bedroom when I was about 7, to our family house burning down in the war, to 18 months of noisy neighbours legal nightmare and no own bedroom for 3 years in our previous flat - and now this...) Hand on heart, I am not out there looking for a fight - quite on contrary, it is my mission in life to find, create, manifest, whatever.... and totally relax into a happy and harmonious home! But something's stopping me, and I don't seem to be able to grow around this particular obstacle. So after a particularly ego-driven couple of days (she's left her bin there for a second day... I moved it, she moved it back under my window... I then remembered to under no circumstances make this fight mine, but the anger was already twisting my insides), I asked the Book of Changes for more insight about T. leaving her bin outside my kitchen window.It came up with hexagram 32, Lasting.All further insight much appreciated."

So I decided to be honest and sent my friend a message basically saying that I felt like I was being punished for something because she's seemed distant and it's been making me feel like I've done something wrong. It felt good to get my feelings off my chest, but now I'm afraid I might have made things worse. I haven't received a reply to my message yet, so I asked the Yi for advice...""What affect will the message I sent have on my relationship with X?"" My response was 61.4 > 10...

230,"Hi everyone,I need your help. A little background: More than a year ago, I met a man on-line, in a social network. This man has become increasingly important to me, but we never met in person. We don't have the same nationality, don't live in the same country and, at this time, there is no way we can meet. He is working a long way from his home country, but he's going back home in a few months. We chatted regularly, shared details about our lives and more recently, we mutually expressed how we felt about each other. We consider ourselves real friends and we care a lot about each other. Both of us have been very careful about this situation, because we both have failed marriages behind us and we both have been hurt a lot and well... I guess we don't want to get things to go to far if there is no chance for a real life relationship. This man has played a very important role in my life, he made me wake up from the numbness I have felt for a long time, after my previous relationship ended. I've never told him that, btw...Anyway, the thing is we have reached a point in which we don't talk so much anymore. I think this happened because we both think alike: why are we doing this, where is this going? Shouldn't we try to meet someone who is physically closer? - I hope I'm making myself clear, sorry for my English, I'm just writing along. So,there is a bit of a crisis going on and I feel very sad about it, so I asked the Yi: Considering the recent developments, what should I do? What is the best course of action? (for me, for him, for us)13.1.3.5 > 35My interpretation:13 - hmmmm... social network environment?13.1 - nothing serious is going on, because - ahem - nothing is going on between us yet!13.3 - we aren't chatting much but we are keeping track of each other's movements. There is no total sincerity here - we are holding back something (well, I am...)13.5 - it seems this blockage can be overcome. OK, I love this line, but I'm afraid of seeing here what I want to see. Are we going to meet or we are going back to chatting regularly again? Don't know.As a relating hexagram, 35 is a really shiny hexagram. I think we can overcome this phase. But what's the advice here? What's Yi's reply to my question? What should I do?Sorry for the long post, your insight will be very much appreciated. And also... today, before using the yarrow stalks, I promised to myself I was going to really think about the answer I'd get and I was not going to ask about this subject anytime soon... I guess writing it here will help me do that too.:bows:"
231,"Hello everybody! I am new to the community but i've been reading your posts for a while... I've been studying the i ching for some time now and most of the time i can intiutively connect to the hexagrams i get. However, things are not always easy when i am overly anxious about an outcome, so i guess i need some outer help this time! So the questions about a romantic relationship that ended in a way that does not make sense to me..I asked ""What are the prospects of this relationship?"" and got 17 unchangeable. I guess that is a clear answer.I asked again ""what if i do nothing to contact him?"" and got 63.1.3, giving 8. ??""what if i try to contact him?"" Answer: 63.9 giving 36OK. So, "" what do you suggest i should do?"" Answer: 5.9.6 giving 37My last question was about his sincererity concerning the reasons he gave for needing time on his own. 37 came up again. No changing lines..I need to poin out that the person in question is a very close friend to some of my closest relatives. Could 5.9 with secon hex being 37 mean that the help i am about to get comes from my relatives? that goes for the last question as well...Thank you all for taking time reading this. I appreciate any insight that could help me clear things out a bit!love, Angeleyes"
232,"Good afternoon,My son and I are lacking financially at the moment. His father is not paying child support, our govenrment support has gone down a little although I have picked up a little bit of casual work.I don't see myself as lacking in abundance in my life but....we could use a little bit more financially.I asked What is the reason we are lacking financially at the moment Hex 12.3.4.6>39What can I do to change our financial situation36.4>55 - well Hex 55 looks promising but getting to the heart of the matter well I guess mainly that is explained in the first paragraph or do I have to dig deeper.I also have a side business that by finding what is hidden in others I get to the heart of the matter although through doing intuitive readings via the tea leaves but business has been quiet for some months now and I do not have the money to advertise.The floods in Queensland stopped a lot of my clientele coming as is usual over the Christmas/New Year break.Any help is greatly appreciated.blessings Melissa"
233,"After facing up to the reality of my marriage coming to an end I been floundering about a bit.  This is bad news as I start my new job on Saturday and really need to focus on it.  This job is the only silver lining in my life right now and I can't afford to lose it by having my mental health affected by my home situation.I asked the I Ching ""What is the secret to finding the inner happiness I seek?"" and received hexagram 55.1.3, relating hexagram 16.I can follow the meaning of 55 I think, that now is not the time to mourn the end of my marriage, but am having trouble deciphering lines 1 and 3 (especially not keen on the broken arm bit!).  Also a little confused on the relating hexagram.Any ideas anyone?Banjara"
234,"I bought a nice jacket in the online sales, and it was a little pricey (but I thought what the hell, it was on sale and it was an item I would wear all the time).Anyway, the jacket didn't work out so I sent it back for a refund via first class post, retaining the postage receipt. The package should have arrived on Monday. But it has not.Worse, I looked on the Royal Mail website and you actually have to get a Certificate of Postage stamped when sending packages in order to get a full refund if the package is lost.So I'm looking at a very costly mistake, very costly.  If the package does not arrive I will not get a refund. I asked the I Ching: Will the package arrive at the retailer?48:3THE JUDGMENTTHE WELL.  The town may be changed,But the well cannot be changed.It neither decreases nor increases.They come and go and draw from the well.If one gets down almost to the waterAnd the rope does not go all the way,Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.THE LINESNine in the third place means:The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.This is my heart’s sorrow,For one might draw from it.If the king were clear-minded,Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.*heart sinking* I'm guessing that is a no. WAH!I'm really hoping Royal Mail (the King - how marvelously literal the I Ching can be) will deliver the promptly. 29 The AbysmalThe Abysmal repeated.If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,And whatever you do succeeds.Dare I hope?!

235,"Hello everyone!I'd need to establish a connection with a certain individual but am pretty unsure regarding the way to do that.I asked the IC ""how to connect"" and got hex 53 changing to 14. It seems to imply that I'd need to find helpers (maybe someone to introduce us? or to organize a meeting?) but also that I should wait for that other person to act first and it seems contradictory. Hexagram 14 seems promissing regarding the connection - and I also think it would be important to meet - so I'd like to know how to do it.Thank you in advance."
236,"Hello, I'd be very thankful if anyone could help me with this. Lately I've been having this horrible days. Nightmares, horrible feelings, goosebumps, feeling like I'm being watched even when I'm sure there is no one there kinda like, please don't think me crazy, im being under psychic attack. I'm not like this, never had this things before, don't have any kind of hallucinating mentel illness but it's been so nasty (T_T).This has been happening under the course of the last 7 months ever since I had this situation with this group. We had a fight, didnt reconcile and I was immature and didnt tell them anything but I left and I left them alone. Like that: no bad dealings just was hurt and left. Cried like a crybaby and said silly things but nothing directed to anyone and nothing serious. Over. Stupid and childish but that's it! I've been having this feeling that some ppl are not wishing me well right now either way. So I tried asking the iching:Who are my ""enemies""? (I don't know really, if it's that group or maybe just me, but i thought the iching would clarify it maybe) I got hex 31.1.3.5What have I done to this ppl? Got 58.2.4.6 bcos whatever it seemed to be i never wanted to hurt anyone!!! >_<What is their problem with me? hex.2.4.5What can I do to solve or make emends to this? hex 11. 2.5.6Whatever it is something outside or maybe just me having a very stressful moment.

237,"I just cannot see clearly...if hex 63 turnes into 49 and I ask what that Revolution of 49 brings, I get 38.2,6 into 25?Will that turn out to be an positive or negative outcome for me (on practical level)? Just don`t know what to prepare for...Anyone had an simillar experiance before, perhaps?"
238,"I read a lot into the Law of attraction / Cosmic Ordering lately and the more I read the more confusing all those opinions you get in the internet become. So I decided to ask the I Ching:""What is it really with the Law of attraction / Cosmic Ordering??""(in a sense of ""is it for real"" ???)the I Ching answered 50.3 > 64still being a learner, an absolute beginner, when it comes to the I Ching I don't really understand what the reply 50.3>64 means as an answer to my question"
239,"Hello everyone,Fed up with hanging around in that inbetween space in the aftermath of a break-up (where nothing seems to happen, head and heart are both still spinning, pain still cuts through, healing comes and goes when it pleases... that kind of a place), I asked the I Ching loud and clear to (pretty please) spell out the difference between my former lover, and my ""true and perfect man"".The answer was Hexagram 49 (Radical Change) with lines 1-5 all transforming, followed by the future Hexagram 7 (The Army).Could this mean that my ex is going through some kind of a transformation which could in turn magically enable us to get it together again, or is it more of a case that my, ahem, true and perfect man is so different from the ex even a woman half-blinded by her broken heart should see it from a mile off (but she doesn't).And in any case, what's with the Army?...OMG: and all this on top of yet another Valentine's!Many thanks."
240,"I found this case to be highly strange and disturbing and my curiosity propelled me to cast a reading in regards to this event. First question I asked was why did he commit this horrible massacre and got Hexagram 48.3 changing to 29.Line 3 reads: The well is cleansed, but still, to my heart’s sorrow, no one comes to drink from it. Yet the water could be drawn. If the king were wise, many could share his good fortune.This indicates that a capable man is at hand but that his abilities are not recognized and no use is made of him. If only someone in high position could appreciate his talents he could do much to help the people. It changes to 29 which is the abyss, darkness, danger, chaos, etc.One interpretation from the I Ching for a New Age: The Book of Answers for Changing Times By Robert G. Benson reads for this line:""He finds himself trapped and so cannot be renewed. He needs renewal, but without help he cannot get it""Seems to correlate well with his mental illness and lack of support from friends, family and mental health professionals.Also, I asked if he could have perhaps been mind-controlled by CIA as an assassin and fall guy as this event caused many fingers to be pointed towards such controversial figures as David Icke, Alex Jones(because of his appearance in the film ""Waking Life"") and the Zeitgeist Movement based on his obsession with the nature of currency and the need to go back to printing ones own currency and going back to the gold standard. He was also obsessed with the use of words to manipulate and control reality and was said to have thought he might in fact be mind controlled himself. To my perception, he seems to fit the mold of someone under MK Ultra.In regards to the latter inquiry I received Hexagram 44.1.4 changing to 9.The main Hexagram 44 seems to suggest some kind of dark approaching influence which is changed to Hexagram 9 or the Taming Power of the Small. From the Wilhelm-Baynes translation of “The I Ching or Book of Changes“Hexagram 9: This hexagram means the force of the small – the power of the shadowy – that restrains, tames, impedes. A weak line in the fourth place, that of the minister, holds the five strong lines in check. In the Image it is the wind blowing across the sky. the wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath of the Creative, and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough to turn them to rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances in which a strong element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. it is only through gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.The changing lines are as follows: Line 1The wheel is checked with a brake of bronze. Righteous persistence brings good fortune. It is not fortunate to have a destination. A lean pig still struggles.A bad influence must be constantly checked and its ill effects will be avoided. But if the restraints are relaxed, as if allowing a chariot to move forward again toward its destination, only misfortune can result. A pig should be fat and so it must not be allowed to run about however hard it struggles. Line 4There is no fish in the bag. Misfortune.It is necessary to make use of inferior people in furthering one’s aims. The man who does not do so will lose them by his indifference, just when he most needs them. So was Jared Lee Loughner the inferior person, the lean pig, conditioned and used to further the aims of this dark force(Hexagram 44)??What do YOU guys make of this?????"
241,"I have a struggle now in how, mentally and therefore emotionally, to approach an issue with the man who just reappeared in my life. I think about him all the time, and had fought last fall to figure out if he had feelings. I finally decided he did not, I put him out of my mind and presumed i'd never see him again.In order to protect my heart, but to also give this a chance -- IF THERE IS SOMETHING there to give a chance to -- how is it to best proceed, for what is best for me in the long run? The Yi says 6.2.3.5.6 >62.Because there are 4 changing lines, not 5, I am paying attention to all 4. I presume it's a path or outline of sorts. Here's my take:L2 -Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. Dont push it. OR, save yourself, spare your inner family the disruption, and return to the peace of your own home or dao. (put it out of your mind??) Calming ones own contentions spares others the unrest.L3 He nourishes himself on the ancient virtues and remains firm and constant. There is danger, but good fortune at last. Who serves a king should do his work and not seek fame. This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. DOnt push. But what is the danger -- it sounds like the danger is on adhering to old virtues, ie dont get stuck in the mud but dont push? middle road? Concretely what does this mean? L5 - The moment has come for conflict. The cause is good and the judgment of an impartial man brings good fortune. Time to submit the conflict to binding arbitration or mediation. There is nothing to lose.This implies an evolution into conflict of sorts but what? Inner conflict in my case already exists. Is this saying dont ask for clarification outwardly on anything (?) thats all i can think of that would cause a conflict in my case. That or expecting/hoping for something and it doesnt happen. Then comes disappointment. But i already feel that inside.L6 - Dont carry the conflict too far. Avoid it. (??)I found this in the archives: ""All the lines leading up to 6.5 tell how to avoid conflict, so the conflict hasn't actually started. Further, the judgement it says, ""A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune."" again suggesting hexagram 6 is about not carrying the conflict too far. Perhaps the good fortune in 6.5 is not only that the judge decides in one's favor, but the fact that there even is a judge, someone who can resolve the conflict before it leads to actual war.Interesting that it is line 6.6 that discribes an actual war like event, as the sixth line is considered to be outside the main message of the hexagram, again emphasizing 6.Conflict is about avoiding, rather than experiencing arguments?""Is the message just ""dont rock the boat now and stay small"" in terms of presenting myself outwardly? My other advisors all suggest the opposite..."

244,"I've been working for this organisation for three years now, on a part-time contract, as outsourcing, to be more precise.It's been a really good cooperation, I loved the job, the money wasn't anything special but I had a lot of free time and the freedom to do other things as well. They've been really satisfied. Now they're offering a full-time position but the conditions just do not work for me in any way: the working hours, the money, the organisational structure.. everything is much worse than with the part-time deal. I have told them - in a nice, calm, reasonable manner - that I would rather keep things as they were BUT I got an idea that they are offended by my not being exhiliarated by the offer and there was a hint of threat in the conversation which led me to believe that it's ""all or nothing"": if I refuse the full-time offer, I can kiss the job goodbye.Still, the offer is really crap.I asked the IC what will happen if I refuse the offer, and got 13.1.3.4 to 20That seems pretty clear....

245,"mother issues.My mother has always been prone to guilt trip (catholic) and lately this has accelerated and focussed upon me to the exclusion of my other siblings. As a reaction I have been not reacting to it but this seems to be bringing it out more and more in my mother. I might mention that I am 30 and am the youngest of my siblings, the others get it too at times but all have noted the increase on me lately and it seems weird because we are all adults now. Anyway currently there have been situations where she has tried to enlist my emotional support in a way that really is only appropriate for my dad to support her with, but he is a hard edged capricorn so I guess she cant find water in that well.I asked: I want to understand this, yi what can you tell me about the emotional manipulation I feel from my mother:36.2.6 > 26I must say I don't like line 2 wilhelm: There is good fortune in thus acting according to duty.because I feel innately opposed to the duty my mother expects of me, but perhaps this is describing this.I like line 6 better: ""The dark power at first held so high a place that it could wound all"" .. kind of sounds like the power my mother had over us as kids (by the way this is just an aspect of my mum, I think of her as a friend whose company I enjoy most of the time)I'm actually not able to place 26 in this. is that her or me. certainly hex 36 on its own feels familiar. and line 6 is hopeful, her actions will naturally conclude themselves, I just have to keep my light to myself?

246,"Hi guys  I've been learning to work with I Ching for a few months now and it has always amazed me with how accurate it is (when you ask the right kind of question that is )but sometimes I'm just not quite sure what it wants to tell me.There is something I'm waiting for to happen and I feel like it might happen in 4-6 weeks from now, so I asked I Ching if I should trust my intuition on this and it will happen when I feel it will or not and received hexagram 25 unchanging. I'm not sure if it's telling me to just trust myself or to not have any preconceived notions about this and not expect anything. So I asked the same question again to clarify and received unchanging 30. What's your take on this? Thanks for your help in advance!"
247,"I've asked about the potential of a relationship with this... much younger guy and got hex 35, all lines changing except line 5, resulting in hex 11.Am I to read all the changing lines and/or to pay attention to the one not changing? Any ideas re the reading?Thanks everyone!"
248,"Hello everyone,I have found myself in a sticky post-break up situation where my intuition tells me I need to at least allow for the possibility of ""it"" not being over, and my common sense tells me to let go, move on in any direction, not invite any further pain, etc.In any case, I am doing nothing, except trying to heal, learn and love the love that couldn't be fully expressed. Then yesterday I suddenly felt exhausted and cross with my own endless meanderings through the past, so asked the I Ching 2 separate questions:HIM?andME?Not the best formula, I know... Still, the answers came:  Hexagram 31 Influence to the ""HIM?"" question, and Hexagram 63 Already Across to ""ME?"" There were no changing lines to either.Very much new to I Ching, I would really appreciate sharing of your thoughts, feelings and impressions on these two hexagrams, especially as they may (or may not!) relate to one another, specifically under my personal circumstances.Many thanks & Happy Divining,Olga"
249,"I am fairly new here. Been ghosting about and reading the forum but only just signed up.The I Ching is fairly new to me and I have been looking to it for guidance over a particularly painful period in my marriage. I have been asking it what I should do to resolve the situation etc and basically keep getting told to be quiet, shut up, find a mediator and all will be well. That is definitely my problem, I poke and prod and back people into a corner to get my answers. Anyway, I followed the advice and left well alone, waiting for my husband to sort out his own problems. I even found a counselor and was overjoyed when my husband asked to meet her too this week.For background, my husband met another woman 8 months ago and they had a couple of business dates before she headed back to her country. They had hit it off over a shared culture and background and also she confided in him her own abusive marriage which he was completely shocked over. They exchanged email addresses and their relationship developed over time. I discovered the relationship in July although at that point my husband assured me he felt only friendship towards her and he agreed to marriage counselling.All seemed to go well with the counselling and we moved to another city with fresh hope, his new job and what seemed like a lot to look forward to. Then she contacted him again..................Since then she seems to have such a big hold on him and has pursued him relentlessly. He is not entirely blameless of course and has nurtured this relationship until he now believes he loves her.The last few months have been absolute hell and I have followed advice almost to the letter. But this morning I found out he is planning to meet her this weekend. I had my suspicions and suggested our son and I went with him on his 'business trip'. He gave a downright 'no' in response and was unable to give any valid reasons. Eventually I *sigh* backed him into a corner and he admitted he was meeting her.He says he has not seen her for 8 months and just wants to see how the land lies between them. He does not know if there is any future for them (his parents are completely against her, he refuses to leave his job to be with her, she is married and lives in another country etc) but he is prepared to meet her and face the consequences. He knows he is wrong and will submit to his fate, living alone even if he discovers there is no future for them. He says he will not come back to me and our young son as he could not have the face to do so. He says he knows he should be punished and accepts it. He just does not know what will happen in the future but wants to see if his online feelings mirror his feelings when he meets her again.This morning I asked the I Ching ""Is my marriage over?"". I got Hex 45, changing line 5, transformed hex 16.I am really not in any state to be trying to interpret this and would really appreciate some help.......Last edited: Jan 14, 2011"
250,"Nobody willing to help?I asked the Iching about a man I am somehow reconnecting. I was having doubts about his attitude or our connection, yesterday I got 22- 24 and that I was helped to interpret as keeping the communication simple.Today he came back to me and told me he is very confused, he is trying to remake his life due to changes in his work. He says he feels out of balance and with so many things to think about, that he is not clear in nothing.I asked the Iching what should be my next steps.I got 38 > 50Would you help me to interpret it? Please?38 it seems to me it talks about me no going after him, maybe staying in touch but no trying anything further?  maybe it is about waiting? around but no too close? It seems to me, it is bad that can become good. kind of the sky when is cloudy, if we try to see the sun we will get upset but if we wait, at some moment the clouds will dissapear and it will rain?

251,Already before I posted things about me being stagnant considering work.Now my question to the IC was if I would be able to find a solution to this stagnacy..23.4 sounds very negative...

252,"I recently posted a reply thanking those who had helped with my earlier question-'Should I buy a camper van?'- but it has not appeared here so possibly I am not using the site correctly?  Anyway, thank you; I am still considering the content of each response.I also then asked for assistance with the following ;The present time is one of major transition for me; my children have now left home, I am single (widowed)  and the current lease on my shop expires in a couple of months and I am condsidering not renewing it, ending a business of 20years. The town is stagnating and this is affecting me,however I have been unable to come up with 'plan B' thus the camper van idea.I asked the YI  about ending the shop here and received  Hex.1( Creative) Moving line 4 changing ti Hex.9  Taming Power of the Small. I was encouraged to receive  Hex 1 but line 4 just seems to throw the question back at me: 'The Superior Man observes without committing himself.'   It seems I have been teetering on the edge of something for far too long already but I also know that part of me clings to the safety of the known.Not asking you to sort my life for me but welcome the kind of insightful perspectives already shared."
253,"Hello to everyone!   Before asking for your help here, i would like to share some thoughts that seem ..interesting to me ( really hope you have the patience to read this..). The past few days, i think i'm having a deep conversation with the Yi. It seems like i'm on an inner journey of some sort and it would be nice if you could somehow join me.   I recently posted a thread regarding a ""relationship"" reading in which (among other's) i had received hex5 line 6. I think it was the nature of the hexagram itself combined with the fact that i felt releived to have shared it (and ofcourse the help i got from the people who answered-thanks again!), that helped me slow down a little bit on the issue and start having more trust in the process ( no matter what that process is!). That's not to say i did not pose any more questions ( i'm not Buddah all of a sudden!), it's just that the questions started becoming clearer and i had a better understanding of when it was time to just stop and reflect!   Anyway, I woke up today feeling like something was changing in my energy. I don't know how to call this but it seems like people talk to me and reach out to me more than usually. I've had many ""ininvited visitors"" (5.6) the last few days and i find myself being receptive and welcoming them. So, i was thinking about  hex 5 and how nice it feels to just wait for things to happen on their own way and time..   And then i started being negative and grumpy about it. ""Look at me! Going around being patient and trusting everything because 3 coins told me to.. Come on girl! Snap out of it! You're in denial here! Wake up and face reality will you??"" . So i started thinking which hexagram might mean "" You're in denial"". I didn't have an answer to it so i just kept that thought and returned home.   As i was browsing through the site i saw some threads on nuclear hexagrams and it suddenly came to me that yesterday i had an interesting reading with lines 2,3,4 changing and it was the first time i had ever noticed a whole (nuclear) trigram changing into another one. It seemed an interesting image and for some reason too interesting to go unnoticed. Like an inner shift of energy of some sort.. i don't know. It occured to me to post a question here about it but then i thought about this whole "" He's just not that into you "" stuff and changed my mind, although i knew inside that it was not so much about that anymore.It was more like a need to go a bit deeper, like the curiosity of a student wanting to learn more.   Anyway, i was too afraid of being criticised or something i guess so i gave up on the idea of asking for help. Since i had nothing better to do....i went for another reading. All the thoughts i wrote about above were in my head, taking turns ( ""5 =wait"", ""How does it show denial?"", ""should i post?""). And that's were it starts getting interesting ( i'm realy thankfull to those who haven't given up yet!).   It was a general question about the relationship image at the moment (although clearly that's not what i needed to ask?!?!).. I got Hex 4.4.5>6OOOK....Deep breath now. I know by now that when 4 comes in the picture the Yi has had enough with me and my stupid questions. That's totally clear between us!! But that was not all! 4.4: "" That's what you get when you're in denial.Got it?""4.5: "" Come on face the fact that you're a newbie and ask for help!!""   For a few moments i was petrified in the thought of the answer being i was living in a fantasy world. Then i thought, ok, so i am ignorant. I realize that, but i am eager to learn so please if there's nothing left for me to do here, let me know:55.5>49 Six in the fifth place means:Lines are coming,Blessing and fame draw near.Good fortune. "" Do ask for advice..""    Still not sure if i got this right, but that's when i decided to write about the hexagram that puzzled me yesterday. So here it is, any insight welcome, i know nothing about it whatsoever, i'm just eager to learn more..:bows:I asked about someonelse's attitude towards the relationship at the moment ( just so i give you an idea)35.2.3.4>18I think i get the general feeling of this (not sure, help welcome on this aswell), but the thing that caught my attention were those specific lines changing altogether, causing a total shift in the inner trigram. It looks like a change of energy, something coming from the inside, ""mountain"" becomes ""lake"", stilness becoming communication or words or something like that. Feels so transformative that it would be a shame not to ask, what would you make of it?? Would you notice it or just let it go by and just stick to the hexagrams and the lines? What do you usually do and what do you see in this specific one ( not Buddah yet, but still eager to know!)??   If you did find the patience to read the whole post i truly, sincerely thank you (and admire you). Sorry for the length of it but it feels good to let out there! Patiently ""waiting"" for feedback,Angeleyes"

I have been using the iching for some years, but only recently started to really get into it and expand my knowledge through this site and various recommended books (which have become precious guidance!)My question relates to a man I met last year, with whom I feel a deep, intense connection. The situation practically was not sustainable in that I am a married woman (although my marriage is undergoing a bit of a major crisis which started a year before meeting this man) and he is a free man we kept it on a friendly level, even though it was clear there was mutual attraction and understanding (we talk and talk and talk..). Last autumn,  a chance meeting meant we both confessed our mutual attraction. Although we were both quite realistic about the fact that this would probably remain an unattainable relationship, I decided to act upon it and we met once recently spending a very romantic time together (nothing sexual).he professes to be very scared of the consequences of entering such an affair, then backtracked by contacting me saying he'd like to see me again, before disappearing again.This person means a lot to me and I would like to keep his friendship, even if that means giving up on the idea that it may become something more (I am aware of the dangers..) so at this stage I would just like to know whether he'll be in touch and how he really feels.I asked the iching about the current situation and got hex38 unchanging,  then asked what is the reason behind  his recent on/off behaviour  and got first hex 49 unchanging .More recently I asked whether this realtionship will continue and got hex 17, line 6 changing to 42.When i asked whether I will be back with him I got 44, line 6 changing to 31.Lastly, i asked what he thinks of me at present and got 44 changing to 20.Any insights will be deeply appreciated!!!thanks"

257,"Dear all, I need your advice about my career path. This time it is regarding where to place my focus. I have drawn out different career options where I can possibly take; a good way to keep my options open. My previous trend (Post job interview) does suggest that I will eventually get my desired job but ....god knows when? Okay, I am restless but trust me, I have tried my ever best to rotate my daily routines...from skiing to sewing and hair cutting.... and now, oil painting. So, i have drawn out four possible options and It is impossible to channel 100% energy to all options. So, I’ve asked Yi, What would be the outcome if I focus on: Option A: Hex 54.2.5>17This is about pursuing a PhD in Research. There are many openings at the moment and I am keen to try my luck. Moving lines in Hex 54 does speak of my past and present state, and that I should continue to pursue my desired career? Option B: Hex 10.3.5>14This is about returning to school for another masters/ postgrad course. It is an option but I am not sure how ideal it is as graduating from school doesn’t necessary guarantee you a job these days…..<- expert on this field. Option C: Hex 30.4> 22I take that as a sudden shooting star in the sky and booom…. It disappears. Option D: Hex 4.1.3>26This is almost a new field to me. Good pay, highly recognized and lots of social skills involved. Hex 4 seems to be targeting my lines about this option and Hex 26 reflects on taking great care of my actions in this field? (application, etc).   And lastly,  ""when will I get a job?"" Hex 29.5>7 = To be patient and if I act correctly, I will escape from danger and the time frame is in mid-April 2011? Insights will be appreciated :bows:Many ThanksTifa"
258,"Dear All, I have had a most interesting session with a trusted gypsy fortune teller - this time, just for a change, she predicts a man coming into my life (and in a very positive way). She has read for me for a few years and has never as yet been wrong. And just when I've decided I've got no time/space for romance!!!Naturally, I got curious as to who it's going to be - the way gypsy fortune telling works, it cannot provide more details except for: "" dark man (100% my usual type, so NOT helpful ) who I have had previous encounters with (party, conversation)"".Ahem.... so I turned to the IC to find out more about this guy: who is he, how will I recognise him? I suppose the question was not very specific, on second thought - is the IC describing the man himself or my previous history with this man: I decided to work on the basis of the latter because it seems to make more sense, but suggestions are welcome as everAnswer:17.2.6 Line 2:""He who clings to the little boy loses the strong man"". Let me see, if it is my history, then yes, I did very publicly date somebody young and silly recently so would have put the other suitor off.If it was the guy- well, I do know a man who chose to go looking for his ""ideal woman"" instead of choosing me when he had a chance  - he has lost me all right, and sadly, in that situation I was ""the strong man"".Incidentally, he's still chasing skirt as far as I am aware.Line 6:""He meets with firm allegianceAnd is still further bound.The king introduces himTo the Western Mountain.This refers to a man, an exalted sage, who has already put the turmoil of the world behind him. But a follower appears who understands him and is not to be put off. So the sage comes back into the world and aids the other in his work. Thus there develops an eternal tie between the two. The allegory is chosen from the annals of the Chou dynasty. The rulers of this dynasty honored men who had served them well by awarding them a place in the royal family's temple of ancestors on the Western Mountain. In this way they were regarded as sharing in the destiny of the ruling family."" (quote from http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/ - one of my favourite sites on the IC)Now - really no idea.If this is me having given up on romantic relationships and being drawn back in, that's nice but not informative. If this is the guy, then what does it tell me about him?Any other interpretation ideas/ clues to how I could clarify? Curiosity killed the cat, but in my case, as ever, it makes for a nice little IC lesson Thank you very much for your input:bows:"
259,"Good morning,I have a highly emotional issue regarding my son's school fees.When he started at the school I was married and my husband and I made the decision to send our son to the school as my husband had been given family money of $200,000.00 and he had a very well paid job.About 2 years ago our marriage ended and there has been continual contention about the school fees.I have 100% responsbility of our son. His father became involved with a woman and they decided to travel. He gives me no financial assistance at all and rings our son every couple of weeks. He does pay half the school fees and deems it my responsbility to pay the other half.When we were married we made the decision that I would be a stay at home mum as his work/career kept him away from home more than 12 hours a day. At different times I had casual work but really gained no concrete skills and at 50 am finding it difficult to get into the workforce.I do have a casual job but the money from that is only allowing me to keep me and my sons head 'above water'.To travel my husband left his job and has gone through all the money he had apparently leaving him with no income at all and his partner is supporting him through her family money. My exhusband and partner are in their 40's.I recently received an invoice for half of last years school fees which was quite a shock and I am now also deemed responsible for paying my half of the fees for the next two years until my son finishes school. Even though my exhusbands father said he would pay for my half of the school fees -for his grandson - my exhusband said no.I am finding this quite a distressing situation as is my son.I asked Yi - Show me a picture of me being free of paying any school feesHexagram 39.3.4>45Why did he knock back his fathers offerHexagram 56.2>50Is this saying by him paying his half it makes him look 'good' in his sons eyes and he hopes it will makes me look bad??thku Melissa xLast edited: Jan 28, 2011"
260,"I asked about a person who came back to my life. I wanted to know what is there, because I can not understand if probably because of fears and desires I also struggle to understand the Iching, it is very complicated for me. Since some time it seems all readings are for good but then I am not sure anymore. Can somebody helps me to understand this reading, please?Hexagram 22 is about weddings, ad children, it means he is getting married and I do not know it? Which is the insight for me? What I have to do?22. Pi / Grace above Kên below LiADORNING / ELEGANCE / GRACEPi indicates that there should be free course in what it denotes. There will be little advantage however, if it be allowed to advance and take the lead.What this means? There should be free course?? Reading Hillary translation it seems to me itis about finding the most beautiful way to communicate. ?? So then I will advance in my connection with him.GREAT SYMBOLISMThe trigram representing a mountain and that for fire under it form Pi. The superior man, in accordance with this, throws a brilliancy around his various processes of government, but does not dare in a similar way to decide cases of criminal litigation.Sorry, but this is like if I am really reading chinese language...A mountain? Maybe talking about obstacles? Then brillance means being the best of myself?? but what it means the best of myself? waiting? Talking my true? dissapearing? So confused I am.,THE LINESThe first line, undivided, shows one adorning the way of his feet. He can discard a carriage and walk on foot. Discard a carriage???? It means I have to be myself ? but I am myself...The second line, divided, shows one adorning his beard.The third line, undivided, show its subject with the appearance of being adorned and bedewed with rich favors. But let him ever maintain his firm correctness, and there will be good fortune.The fourth line, divided, shows one looking as if adorned, but only in white. As if mounted on a white horse, and furnished with wings, he seeks union with the subject of the first line, while the intervening third pursues, not as a robber, but intent on a matrimonial allianceI hope he is not getting married with somebody else......I think the adorning could be him that feels he does not hve enough to offer, or feeling shame for somethings he is and have done ??? I can not understand beyond ... The fifth line, divided, shows its subject adorned by the occupants of the heights and gardens. He bears his roll of silk, small and slight. He may appear stingy; but there will be good fortune in the end.The sixth line, undivided, shows one with white as his only ornament. There will be no error.then it turns to 24, Hillary writes, it is about something beginning to germinate..What does it means? I read it as something good? She also says:Your journey leads you out and home again, through the turning points on your way. Vigour and authenticity return in the still moments of those turning points; life regenerates from the roots, and light returns. By walking constantly to and from your source, you participate in a two-way flow of creation You go out and rediscover your own way; you return through an open door to your home and relationships. Since you are in motion, helpers of all kinds come – travelling companions who walk alongside you for a while. (If someone is meant to be with you, you will never need to leave your path to chase after them.)  What does this mean? My path is my life, I should be able to focus in my life, whilst he is having doubts maybe? Then what I am supposed to do, nothing? I am lost..trying to understand.Just as any road can be travelled in two directions, your path also leads both out and back again, and so – in the fullness of time and following a natural progression – there comes a moment to turn round.Through all this going and coming and starting afresh, it is good to have an overarching direction and purpose to guide you. The quality of Returning is alive, growing and dynamic – a good time to rediscover your own deepest intent and its harmony with the Dao.Then what is the insight for me, about this connection with this man?22 to 24Can somebody give me a hand., please?.Thank you"
261,"Hi All,After some discussion, I wanted to ask the yijing this question about a partnership ""What would be the effect of working with x""I received hexagram 10 (changing lines 2,3,6) going into 49.Overall it seems like I should, however line 3 throws me off (it being the one from my understanding being the most important).Main question I have is should I proceed working with this person?"
262,"Hello, I'm a new member, but have been reading the forum archives regularly as I study the IC on my own & attempt to answer my own questions -- I'm staggered by the depth of the interpretations I read here!I'm hoping for help with the following divinations, or your thoughts as to whether I'm on the right track in my considerations, and what I might be overlooking:Why did I stop writing?  61 unchangingFor the past two years my writing has been halted (it was grinding to a halt a year before then): I stopped work on a novel I'd been working at for five years; even stopped writing in my journal. I've been at a very demanding college teaching job instead. I become painfully conscious of this whenever I see news of writer friends who are publishing a lot. I've been trying to understand if this is just ego, or if the pain is the expression of a gift I know I have but am not using.  (And if I'm not, why not??)Part of my thinking has been that I felt the writing was 'empty' -- too focused on form, surface, and I didn't have enough insight into people & needed to develop that more before proceeding.  I'm hoping that 61 might be drawing that perception back to mind.  But I'm afraid it means, instead, that I stopped writing because I wasn't meant to write, or that I'm missing some quality that would lead me to success as a writer.  Second question posed: What change would be needed for me to begin writing again?  1.2.5.6 > 55.  This seems positive: ok, you do have creative power, and there's potential for abundance.  (Am I being too optimistic here?)  But I'm not sure how to read the advice contained in the changing lines (well, 2 and 5 anyway) in this context.  That's a long post -- I'd be so grateful for any insights."
263,"Hi,I have recently started something with someone and I really like him and he seems to like me too. However we do not live in the same place, and I am making plans to leave the country etc and he isn't sure where he's going etc.We've been friends for a while and just now it's taking this romantic turn. We have arranged to meet again though yet to be confirmed. I guess after all the giddiness I'm starting to fear I may be getting over-excited. Starting to think I should prepare for the worst. Basically terrorizing myself.I've asked a few Q's on the subject. My first was 'What should I know about this'?58.2,5>51Either reflecting me hurting myself with my negative expectations and reminding me to remain open and remember it's about the joy of communicating (we did a lot of that I thnk!) and 51 - either  a warning about the situation's potential shock if he does back off, or how I am arousing myself too much.I asked a few more, just to confuse myself and exasperate yi perhaps. What I really want to know, is, Is he committed to me? (or at least the idea of me as I am him)Hex 44Uh oh. Not exactly 32... I wonder if he sees me as overbearing? Try as I might, I think I always seem to act over-enthusiastic and thwack away that 'mystery' that's supposed to keep men interested. Or, I guess it could be saying - opposite of commitment - that he sees it as a fling? A sexual thing?Could really use some help here.I really like him. But cannot help being afraid.

264,"Hello!So I was flicking through the telly while having a cup of joe when I stumbled on a show on the history channel called ""Apocalypse Island"". It was about the Mayans and the rare transits coming in 2012: the rare Venus Transit and the Galactic Alignment. Anyhoo, this got me to musing again on 2012 and I realized I've never inquired about it from the I Ching, so I thought, why not?!Before the reading, I pulled up an astro chart for Dec. 21, 2012 set for NYC 11:11 UTC. I've been seriously studying astrology for the past year so it was interesting to look at.I noticed immediately that Uranus was exactly conjunct the fourth house IC(home/ground of a chart) so I immediately thought 'ground shaking change'. Another aspect I noticed was that Mars was in the second house(finances) exactly conjunct the Anti vertex(""Destiny's Gate""). I also did a synastry for the chart of America (birth date 7/4/1776) with the Galactic Alignment date and noticed that Americas Pluto at 27degrees Capricorn is exactly conjunct the Mars and anti-vertex of Dec 21, 2012 in the second house(economy). This points to a devastating financial collapse! I'm freaking out but definitely not surprised.Anyhoo, so back to the I Ching. The first question I asked was what will happen in America around 12/21/2012?I got Hexagram 59.2.6 changing to 8.Hexagram 59 – Huan – Dispersion [Dissolution]Nine in the second place means:At the dissolutionHe hurries to that which supports him.Remorse disappears.Nine at the top means:He dissolves his blood.Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,Is without blame.This reading seemed favorable since the dissolution leads to union. Also the lines point to hurrying to the support or temple and dispersing with bloodiness(or avoiding harm). Another interpretation also adds 'rescuing ones kin', so that sounds nice.Then I asked what awaits me personally (I know it's a bit silly to ask as there are soo many factors but I thought the I Ching might be able to point out a theme to watch for). For this, I got Hexagram 63.3 changing to 3. After looking over the hexagram and line, I realized immediately that this was directed not just at me but the whole country.Hexagram 63 – Chi Chi – After CompletionNine in the third place means:The Illustrious AncestorDisciplines the Devil’s Country.After three years he conquers it.Inferior people must not be employed.or, ""It took The [ancient emperor], without the use of the common people, three years to subjugate [the population]."" [Upon completion, relief]This reading I wasn't too sure of. Here is 'After Completion' (the end of the Mayan Calendar) changing to Sprout (the seed of a new world, the beginning). That seems fine. But the changing line troubles me. Who is this Ancient Emperor? The Devil's Country? And isn't 'subjugate' synonymous with enslave? Police State anyone?? ugh.. Also, it says it took him '3 years' to subjugate the country. This correlates perfectly with the Pluto square Uranus transit which will be in effect all through 2015. This aspect hasn't been around since the 1930s(Depression era and start of unrest that led to WWII) and Pluto is in Capricorn(plutocracy and corporate power in its densest form), last time this happened was during the American revolution. Meanwhile the planet of revolutionary change, Uranus, is in Aries (the individual, freedom fighter, rebel). Wowowo can you say INTENSE!?!? Soo, my question is who is the Illustrious Ancestor? Who is subjugating whom? Pluto reigning in the rebellious Uranus? or Uranus overthrowing and changing the state of the stale, domineering Pluto??Kindly,sibyleyes"

267,"Just got a call from a prospective employer in the new city today.  It's returning to a previous profession, a field I haven't worked in about 10 years.  Needless to say, I'm nervous about the interview and the job itself.  I haven't done this particular job, but have trained several subordinates to this particular position and consulted with people who have had this job in the past (not at this business, however). My credentials should have impressed this business owner, now....is this the opportunity I've been looking for in X City?So, I asked Yi ""How will the job interview go?""  and got a 60.5.6 > 41.  I believe the IC is reflecting my current situation in hex 41, as the job I'm interviewing for promises to be rather lucrative and I'm struggling financially now.  I think Yi is reminding me to stay humble and stay within what's reasonable for the interview (following socially acceptable behaviour rules here) in line 5, but the constraints in line 6 concern me.  What do you take that to mean?I followed up and asked ""If I were to take the job, how would it go?"" and received a 43.2 > 49.  Could that mean that in a time of total transformation in my life (which I truly feel this will be), that this new job/transition/move won't be easy, but if I keep my wits about me and prepare financially for any potential problems down the road, I'll be okay?  This job is known to have a very high turnover rate.  High pay, but high stress and hot heads usually mean this kind of job can be one with a revolving door in some cases...others, I've seen ones stay in this position for years.  It really depends on the person, IMO.  Thanks for your input on this....now to go do research on the company and leave Yi alone.  It's so tempting to ask it a kazillion questions when you're anxious like this!"
268,"After 37 years of marriage my dad began a clandestine affair with another woman.  He's never been like this before, not a cheater, morally upright, faithful and honest.  But he's extremely depressed, forced into early retirement, lost 90% of his retirement in the stock market and we have watched his personality change, feel no remorse, and turn my family on its end.  My dad spent the last several years building my parents dream house, and because my dad had a bunch of stops and starts at cutting off contact with this woman, my mom is living with her mom and taking care of her and has gone through over 3 years of rejection and repeated humiliation (public and private).  The most painful thing about this is seeing my dad destroy his life, hurt my mom and lose us and still be unwilling to let this woman go, who he sees as the holy grail of his happiness or answers to all of his lack.  I can't have a relationship with my father because it's too painful to hear him say things like ""you dont understand"" when he is clearly in an unhealthy addictive relationship with this woman.  In a sense, I am mourning my father now as if he is dead and it's so painful, because I was really looking forward to rebuild a relationship with him, but it's too painful to hear his justifications and lack of empathy towards all of us.I asked the Yi, how does my dad feel about losing me and got45.1.2.5 > 54I'm not sure what to make of it, but I get the impression that if we ever talk again, it's not going to be a full reconcile, but a polite or cheap imitation of what our relationship used to be.Any help on this reading?

It was a quick chit chat to learn more about the company and what I am able to offer them. Unlike my previous post, this interview is actually for a job opening, a position in and out of research.  So, I asked Yi, 1) "" what impression have I created to Miss X?"" Hex 58.1.3.4.5>46I am a chatty person and perhaps speaks a little bit too much?

Short, direct and business. 3) ""what are my prospects in getting the job?""

275,"So there is this guy, and his interest in me has been going on and off, the same with my interest for him. We're both kind of inexperienced, shy and not sure what to make of it all. I've had many chances to take a step in asking him out and kind of telling him about my feelings, but I never could. At some point I started to give him the cold shoulder, and then I stopped doing that and acted nice towards him, I regret the mistakes I have made. He seems to be most uninterested in me when he is around his male-friends (which made me sad), but when he's with me and I flirt, he flirts back and it feels good. There's something about him that pulls me and I'm curious to find out what it is. I'd like to confront him in a way and maybe ask him if he wants to watch a movie with me. I asked I Ching about this and I got Treading (Conduct) (10) with Nine in the second place as changing line. The hexagram changes into Innocence (the Unexpected) (25)=======From Treading (Conduct)For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happened in good humor [Tui] and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part.Click to expand...So maybe my ''asking out'' will be taken as something nice? (if he either says no or yes)In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.Click to expand...I guess this means to act gently and considerate?If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them We can quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and make not demands on people.Click to expand...Again the key to remain content and not demanding, to not become obsessed and be glad for any outcome, and have understanding for it.When a man is dissatisfied with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore blame attaches to his progress. On the other hand, a man who is good at his work is content to behave simply. He wishes to make progress in order to accomplish something. When he attains his goal, he does something worth while, an all is well.Click to expand...This is just spot on, something I need to pay attention to. I feel like time is running out, I feel like I might lose him to someone else, and I feel like I have to ask him out asap. Maybe the key is to relax, and take things slowly. But how? I've thought about it and I think this is the right period for me to ask, but I don't want to scare him off....So this is the changing line I got:The situation of a lonely sage is indicated here. He remains withdrawn from the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks nothing of anyone, and travels through life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does not challenge fate, he remains free of entanglements.Click to expand...Lonely indeed. This is like saying it's best for me to withdraw, and this answer is scary to me, because withdrawing would mean to me that I might lose another chance on getting to know him better and maybe find out how he feels about me. A one-eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear vision. A lame man can indeed treat, but not enough to make progress. If in spite of such defects a man considers himself strong and consequently exposes himself to danger, he is inviting disaster, for he is undertaking something beyond his strength. This reckless way of plunging ahead, regardless of the adequacy of one's powers, can be justified only in the case of a warrior battling for his prince.Click to expand...Perhaps it is a plunging ahead?The work is ended. If we want to know whether good fortune will follow, we must look back upon our conduct and its consequences. If the effects are good, then good fortune is certain. No one knows himself.

So far my actions are fruitless, they confuse, him and myself. This is why I want to do things differently. But maybe I can't do that yet. Maybe I think that I've learned from my mistakes, maybe I'm not ready to apply them yet... Oh God...============From Innocence (the Unexpected)His mind is natural and true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the fundamental or unexpected.Click to expand...Yes... well it was innocence that brought me closer to him. And I guess when I started to overthink and overanalyze things I lost my way. And now I'm back to overthinking and overanalyzing. But what is the right way? If I am just content and have no concious plans in the back of my mind, then how can I ever let him know how I feel about him? Maybe I should just wait for that moment? And not create it myself?Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through perseverance"". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: ""He who departs from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing do not go with his deeds.""Click to expand...without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage... but jeez, that is hard. Any comments on ''that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven''?Under heaven thunder rolls:All things attain the natural state of innocence.Thus the kings of old,Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,Fostered and nourished all beings.Click to expand...""In harmony with the time"", maybe I should just stop overthinking and worrying and being afraid that I might ''lose'' him, and just do my daily stuff, and be myself, BUT keep in mind that if the moment ever comes, to not be afraid, to stand on both feet and ask him out. Because I used to be very afraid, I don't want to be afraid anymore, but I also don't want to scare. What do I do with the feeling ""Oh no, I think I lost him, I need to let him know that I do care about him, before he ""goes"".""....I really need your help, is there any thoughts that you would like to share? Please do.Thanks."
276,"As promised in this thread, I have another girl on my mind I need to ask about now.  A little background:I went on a few dates with her in February/March.  Things fizzled out, more on her part than mine.  Over the next couple of months I kept thinking about her, and once in a while I would try to contact her only to be rebuffed in my attempts.  I definitely felt there was potential and was starting to feel attached to her.  I was (and still am) 100% sure she is attracted to me physically, even though we've only gone as far as kissing.  She finally told me in May that she didn't see any long term compatibility between us and as far as timing goes, she was having fun being single.  She definitely seems to like to go out a lot.Anyhow, I really tried to let it go but I felt like I must have done something wrong and it was bothering me a lot.  Was I too aggressive, pushing to be more physical to fast?  In the last couple of months the feeling got stronger and stronger, and I started feeling worse and worse.  I finally sent her a long email last month baring myself and telling her about some of my own issues which I feel might have contributed to my behaviour of treating women as objects.I didn't expect her to respond but she did, and she was very nice about it.  We met up for drinks and dinner a couple weeks later just to catch up as friends.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but everything went very well -- it was very comfortable with no awkwardness at all.  She even came back to my place to watch a bit of TV before I drove her home.  I made it clear to her that I was looking for a relationship (not necessarily with her, but in general).  I confirmed after this meeting that I was still attracted and drawn to her and it was not just because she didn't want to see me anymore.  I'm really ready to have a relationship right now rather than just date around.That weekend we met up at a club (I told her where I would be, and she dragged all of her friends there so that she could meet me there), and things escalated physically very quickly.  We danced and kissed all night at the club.  She asked me ""I thought we were going to be friends?"" and I replied ""I want more than that"".I had one more date with her a week and a half ago, and again it went really well.  Now she is being really wishy-washy about seeing me again when I approach her to make another date, similar to how she behaved back in March.  I've tried contacting her twice already with either no response or something like ""I don't know, I'm busy this week"", and if I do again I'm afraid I'll come off even clingier than I have already.  I think the ball is in her court now.Right now I'm vacillating between trying to see this through (I know it's going to take her time to get out of wanting to be single), or moving on.  So I've asked the I Ching the following questions:a) General Diagnosis of the relationship between X and I56.1>30Do I belong here at all, should I still have hope that it will work out?b) Qualification of my position within the relation46.2>15I believe this is just echoing my state of mind.  I think I will have to work hard for her.c) Qualification of X's position within the relation43.5>34I think she is still not sure about me.  What will she decide?d) What is the best path for me to take related to this relationship?58.1.2.5>16I'm not sure how to interpret this one.Any insight into this would be extremely helpful.Last edited: Aug 19, 2009"

282,Today has been a hell of day...one which I saw something that I had been pursuing was an illusion and I had to give up on.  Its funny because when I asked the iching about it the answer was 51 which was the case.   That situation got me thinking.  Ive been working on a business idea for the last 8mos and its almost ready to go public but today got me the thinking I may be waisting my time on an illision so I asked.  Will  it work? and I got 32 . 1. 2 changing to 55.  I need some help with this one.   32 from my understanding is about enduring or not changing.

285,Hello.  I have a situation with a women in my life.  I've known this women for 13 years and we have dated on and off during that time.  We both had a fear of commitment and whenever things got close we both ran.  At the begining of this year we told each other how we felt about the other and we both have strong feelings for one another and have expressed a desire to attempt a serious relationship.  Its strange because I see now that what we have is what I want in a relationship.  I dont know why this happened now but I guess thats how it is.  I asked the question whats likely to become of out relationship in 2011 and got 3. 3. 6 changing to 37.   Line 3 speaks of not going into the situation and line 6 of failure which sucks.  The corrisponding hex of 37 is about family so im confused.  Will it fail or lead to a family situation.  Thanks for any attempts. 
286,"Hi everyone,I have been taking some time to process the last year, and think about what I would like in the year ahead and beyond.  I would really like to find my place in the world. For me that involves having a job I really feel passionate about, as well as having someone in my life to share a committed, loving relationship with.  I would really like to have a child soon - being ready to bring a great human being into the world and love them enough to let them reach their own full potential has also been a real priority for me. So I asked the Yi if having a child, securing a job I absolutely love, and a committed and loving partnership will happen in the near- or far-term for me?The Yi returned with Hexagram 2, no lines changing. That's a big answer to a big question - I thought I would ask some of the more masterful practitioners on this forum about their thoughts? In case it helps, here are the issues at hand - and pardon the length  My relationship status can be seen on my two other threads.  In terms of my job status, I had a great career in entertainment, but things really fizzled and I had to return to my childhood home to look for work from there and save money - a very humbling, emotional experience. Just the other day I was called in to interview at a well known toy company and they told me they might offer me a position within the next week . The position is in a very cutting edge area of content that I have been aiming toward, but it is strictly children's content - an area I've never had much interest in. So although it could be put me at the top of a new wave, I worry about being pidgeon-holed into ""kids content"".It would also keep me in my hometown - I'm a city girl at heart and 6 months in my hometown is already is making me a little bonkers!   I can overlook location because I really need the work though, and having a child right now is a priority.  It's just that there is also the issue of my former partner - we experienced a big rift this past year over distance and communication issues, and separated despite deeply loving each other. I did not think we would speak again even though the Yi told me we would in my last reading!  And so of course, they very recently asked to reconcile with me. Sadly, they are not a citizen and job status, or at least a student visa, is requisite for them to be here. Being in a small place such as this may put us back at square one, and this is really the person I see as a life-partner My question came out of all these issues, and a hope that somehow these desires would be able to come fruition together.  Any help would be great, as so far I am reading this as a ""sit and see"" answer, or for me to at least not push anything to happen?  Also, I'm wondering if Hex 2 may be addressing the ""motherhood"" aspect of the question...Thank you lovely people in advance!:bows:Blu7"

290,"Good morning from Montreal (Canada)....Last night, my best Friend died of a very sudden death... She was my buddy, a true kindred spirit and a pillar in my life. I will miss her terribly.

She died on January 11, 2011, she and I would have celebrated 11 years of frienship this week, my own birthday falls on an 11 (may).. I figured her death had a certain significance to me other than the obvious fact that I lost someone very close to me. I asked the iching what Marlène's death meant in the general context of my life...

291,"Hi all,I am set to meet up with someone I've been emailing. It's going to kind of be a blind date because we only met once, but we've been emailing recently.

Especially if he has one idea and I another. But then of course in the flesh it might be different... Perhaps I should try not to have any expectations either way.And 30 is sort of about spreading your light indiscriminately isn't it? I wonder if there's a danger of him 'clinging' to the idea of me?

295,"Well… Bradford came over to the UK from the States to see Cesca, and while he was here we got together and went over to Holland to see LiSe (and connect up with Harmen, too). And this was brilliant in many, many ways. I want to share the reading I did for the trip, as a) it’s a lovely reading and b) it shows how understanding of hexagrams and lines keeps on changing in the context of new experiences.I didn’t ask a complicated question, just ‘advice and comment for the trip…?’ – I simply wanted something to hold in mind and help me not to miss anything while I was there. Yi came back with Hexagram 38, Opposing, changing at lines 1 and 3 to 50, the Vessel. So we have a bunch of wildly irreconcilably different ways of seeing, all contained and cooking together in one Vessel.And that is exactly – exactly – what happened.I’ve got to admit that the moving lines, though, are taking their sweet time in making sense to me. Here they are:‘Regrets vanish.Lost horse: don’t pursue it, it returns of itself.See hateful people,No mistake.’‘Seeing the cart dragged back,The oxen stopped,Your men branded and their noses cut off.With no beginning, there is an end.’I haven’t seen any hateful people; I generally don’t. I’m starting to wonder, in fact, whether ‘fierce people’ might be a more useful reading of this – something else you don’t need to react to, like the lost horse. (Anyone have any defining experiences to share?) And despite my apprehension after looking at line 3, all my trains ran perfectly and I reached Folkestone in plenty of time to meet up with Cesca and Brad.One thing the lines are certainly doing, though, is providing plenty of wry commentary on the way we found our way about.‘Seeing your road signs indecipherable,Your ferries going in unexpected directions,And your return bus disappearing mysteriously.’- that kind of thing. But Brad has a sense of direction, LiSe translates from the Dutch tomtom, Cesca has remarkable patience and an unerring instinct for picking the right direction to turn in out of the two or three being called out to her at once as she drives, and the horse keeps on finding its way home somehow – through ‘the average of our errors,’ as Brad put it. We weren’t lost, just arriving differently.Or as Yi put it,‘With no beginning, there is an end.’After our time in (and around) Amsterdam, I have a new understanding of that one: there are no patterns predefined, nothing clear-cut (the word for ‘beginning’ is the one with roots in ‘cutting out the cloth’); nothing, in fact, that looks remotely likely to lead anywhere specific. And yet somehow we kept arriving somewhere, and in one piece. (‘Fuzzy logic,’ Brad says.)My previous take on this was that the Great Possession of Opposing (38.3 changes to 14) lay in having people taking a different view of your possessions, your cart and oxen, with unpleasant results. That might be present – maybe it’s more that it’s hard for diverse people always to keep track of exactly what gifts each one of them has to offer – but what struck me most was the emergent 14. With no beginning, somehow you still end up with a Great Possession more than the sum of its parts.We saw plenty of lovely, clear illustrations of that. There was the navigation thing, and there was the day we spent in Amsterdam with not much idea where we were going, but generally assuming we’d know it when we found it. And then there were our Yi discussions: Cesca was brave enough to share her annual reading, first with Brad, who looked at transitional hexagrams, then LiSe and I, who looked at the lines in the original hexagram, then with Harmen, who did startlingly succinct and fluent things with trigrams. Inspired by her example, I offered up my annual reading, and that became the subject of Brad and Cesca’s first joint interpretation. (Recommended!)Possibly my favourite example was a bit more literal. Before Brad and Cesca came round one morning, LiSe (who gets up unspeakably early) thought to cook some squash so we’d have something to eat in the evening. When we got back, we started thinking about what to put with it… there’s some broccoli, Cesca suggests steaming it before adding, LiSe wants to know if we’re happy with our onions fried with soy sauce, I suggest adding some grated cheese, LiSe finds pecorino… and somehow all this Diversity goes together splendidly in one large Vessel, and we ate our reading.*****​Afterword…I forwarded this post to Brad, Cesca and LiSe before publishing it. Let me just add their comments to the pot:Brad says:​“* I don’t see the these particular ways of seeing as irreconcilable – they simply can’t be added together without having the picture evolve and deepen. But it’s true that I can’t reconcile something like bunched fat meats or cleaved ewe shins or twitching captives with my own understanding.* “hateful people” – I read “(on)* seeing the worst (or wrongness) in others”, but for me it means simply that we need to start by seeing others for who they really are and respond accordingly.”​​(See how he says he sees hexagram 38 differently? A few decades of working with Yi have left the man with a pretty nicely developed sense of irony, so I expect he sees what he’s done there… {""lightbox_close"": ""Close"",""lightbox_next"": ""Next"",""lightbox_previous"": ""Previous"",""lightbox_error"": ""The requested content cannot be loaded.

Even the spiders in the Heyboer house make art.And LiSe says:“I love it! But you forgot the bus driver who had to ask the passengers for directions. She had never before been there, and when the road seemed blocked by the big whateveritwas (a JCB?) she thought she had lost the right road.”​That was when we were on our way in for the day’s meandering in Amsterdam. Definitely ‘no beginning’ whatsoever.She also points out that you add the soy sauce after frying the onions, which is good to know."

Already three times when asking (3) various questions about him and my relationship to him I get 36 or 36 as following hexagram. 36 is dark. Not the most wished for hexagram one could like to cast... Dark.But! It is about a very -dark- african man we're/i'am talking here about. He very much doesn't give me shivers of negative and dark energy. The contrary I say.I encountered the IC sometimes responding very literaly. Like a couple of years ago asking things about the health of my doggy and getting -Chien- hexagram 15: modesty/egolessnes while -Chien- means literaly means -Dog- in French (France is the country where I live)..If the IC is 4000 years old... but that time 'one' didn't know alot about the other 'races', the black, red or white... How to describe.. black.., dark..I'd love to exchange of insight in this literaly/non-literaly outcomes of the IC with fellow forum members.Namaste"
303,"I really need some help here as I am facing a few tough decisions regarding my career.  I am currently working as a freelance for a couple of firms, both of which present with a possibility of a partnership in the near future.  I can remain working as a freelance or try to explore moving up the ladder with one of them.  I don't know which path I should explore (if any) so I asked tonight (having in mind the partnership):1.  What if I go down the GH route? responce Hex 16.2.5.6 to 62.  What if I go down the G&G route? responce Hex 47 unchangingNeither seems particularly positive to me, perhaps the answer in hex 16 is to stay put for a while?

306,"hi everyone,my last post was about the process of finishing a bulky manuscript I had waiting in the drawer for too long, which I am just about to complete in the next days. This ending brought about a great amount of insecurity and doubt. Not so much on whether it is good or will friends and editors (first set of readers) like it, but much more about how exposed I am in it, being so biographical. In a strange symbolic way... I feel very vulnerable, wake up in the middle of the night sweating, and just have terrible thoughts that I should not deliver it next 15th, as I said I would. I started asking the Y about what was going on with me and the answers were quite ominous, very much around 44, but the misfortunate lines... Therefore I have these two I would appreciate some support with : 1 - There seems to be serious faults in this book - how can I still correct them? 56, 3 > 352 - What can I do throughout this one last week (until the 15th) in order to deliver the best manuscript possible ? 10, 2 > 25Im just scared, so it clouds my ability to read anything at all... the relating hexagrams (35, and 25) seem to indicate there is no big deal about it, merely the problems of an early draft with an unexperienced (and overemotional) writer. I didnt plan to work so much in it this next week, but 10,2 seems to indicate it would be positive to maintain this ongoing writing retreat (help, im stuck here for 3 weeks now!) and maybe from silence and concentration some new solutions will surprise me (25). This is now the plan for the week...but what could possibly mean that I burn my house and loose my servants ?Thank you, any help is needed and thanked! yoana"

309,"My annual reading came in two parts this year.  The holiday season was incredibly busy and I never quite found the time or space to really sit and consult.  I use the marble method, and finally one day in exasperation I just went oh what the heck, got as calm as I could and put my hand in the bag.  I got:22 ==> 16  1,3,4,6  Grace -> EnthusiasmDespite the method, I was pleased with the result. It seemed very appropriate and immediately began to infuse more calm and simplicity into my busyness.  Enough so that last weekend I did find the time and peace to do some annual reflection.  I didn't exactly want to re-do my annual reading - it doesn't work that way - but as the afternoon wore on, I increasingly felt called to do so.  And from a good deep place got:9  unchanging    Taming Power of the SmallWhich is of course exactly the opposite of 16!I think it's going to be that kind of year - much balancing of opposites and resolving of contradictions.  I'm taking the first reading as a sort of John the Baptist, ""prepare the Way"" reading, and the second as the true appropriate foundation of the year.  Or maybe I should take it as I got all real work of the year done in 6 days, and now I will just be doing it over and over for the rest of the year, nurturing small changes week after week..."

I worry about him as he is very much an introvert & a homebird which is fine but he has no social contacts outside of home & doesn't seem to want any, he is 18 and has been like this since he was about 15, he has left college & works at home alone.  I feel if I nudge him towards being social he resents it.  I asked the I ching if I had cause to worry as other adults in my extended family often make comments that he's a loner ect. & this leaves me wondering how I can best support him. I asked the i ching again 'will he find friends in time' and got 47.2 3 > 31 I am thinking the first  reading is saying all is okay as it end with enthusiam ! & the second I am thinking means accept that his life path may not be conventional in the social sense ??

316,Why did I read the thermostat as 63 when it was actually 73?Hexagram 49.1.2.3.5.6 changing into hexagram 64. Hexagram 49 has to do with Radical Change and 64 means Incompletion or Before Climax.

317,"I ching question: i had a dream in which i am in a bus and obsessive about aliens (greys) and looking at the sky all the time to see if there is something, i was scared of them. nothing appears. from being busy in looking for greys i missed my destination station. Now i get off the bus and need to go home a long way on foot despite my tiredness. i ask my soul if i will ever meet them, the soul says, no. What does that mean?I ching gives:The present is embodied in Hexagram 14 - Ta Yu (Possession in Great Measure): There will be great progress and success.There are no changing lines, and hence the situation is expected to remain the same in the immediate future.The things most apparent, those above and in front, are embodied by the upper trigram Li (Fire), which represents brightness and warmth.The things least apparent, those below and behind, are embodied by the lower trigram Chi'en (Heaven), which represents strength and creativity.first, the i ching says i am gonna do it big in what i want to achieve, in every question i ask recently.second, i had a new mystical understanding today on the nature of greys from looking at aleister crowley lam drawing. And i thought this understanding drives my fear away from them. Yet in the dream i was obssessed scared and excited about them, which is in complete contrast with what the ching says. It look like the dream implies i am missing something, but the i ching says...Any ideas?"

320,"hiI'm new to this and just bought an I Ching book written by Hillary Barrett. I picked it up because the wording and yin and yang symbol on the cover touched a familiar nerve that I have for the Dao ti ching and thought it would be similiar. I was a little surprised when I came to find out it was an ""interactive"" book. I have been doing a lot of soul searching the past few years and have got a pretty good grip on my spirituality.Through meditation and reflection and becomming aware of what is already here instead of searching. I have felt that maybe I have an overactive crown chakra and am a little flighty and concentrating too much on my spiritual aspect and I am having a hard time re-grounding myself. So I played along with the I Ching and asked it a question. ""How can I take my knowledge and truth that I have learned through my spiritual awakining and put it into use on this physical earth"" in other words how can I put my ideology into practice. Well my response was ""stop"". It was hex34 with 9on4 which changes to 11. Im sure that there is a good reason for this but I really wanted to go out and do something and basically I am getting a stay were you are kinda vibe. And I dont want to go rushing off into the hedge and get stuck. So maybe a little feedback from an expert would help.thanksrob"

324,"Hello she says sheepishly - I almost dread putting a post up here as I feel that I am asking alot of you all at the moment for help - but there has been something still just nagging away at me and that's the not knowing whether I am saying goodbye on the18th Jan to our marriage when he leaves - not knowing whether to grieve its loss or aim high and keep the home fires burning.. I still love him and he me, but I just don't know where we stand in the long run.I asked the I Ching 'what is best for me in this marriage?' thinking of all the above really - am I letting go or am I holding strong while he does what he needs to do.  I suppose I wanted to have a guide as to what is really happening.  I got 22:4 leading to 30 and when I read Peters interpretation in a thread a while ago - it was quite relevant - or at least I would hope so.  He talked about line 4 - (not sure if I can get a quote from an old thread to here) being about the uncertainty of the querent and the choice you have - to dwell on the negative or the simpler path of the positive - and the love - who is coming from  heart & truth, will return and woo you & all will be well.  That's one interpretaion and then very recently on the threads here, by tifa and circe the line was talking about initial loss and then future gain & being true to your path. It leaves me wondering if this is still my husband that is being talked about or whether this is the loss of the marriage, but there is a better outcome in the end.  When I read the various interpretations in the books I have I felt quite hopeful whatever the outcome as it seems a positive reading whatever happens.Line 4 in 22 does seem to be answering about love and marriage, so it would be good to get it right to add to my melting pot of answers I've had recently.  Do you have a thought in relation to this question?  I think that will then tie the threads together of my situation and how best to respond to it all with the insight of the I Ching.  Thank you."

326,"hi all,since i am still really coming to grips with the power of the Yi, and I have been voraciously exploring, I am still in the midst of really becoming comfortable with the hexagrams and need to confirm what I am getting.The man that I love comes from a different culture than my own and because of that his parents currently are throwing up road bocks to his desire to be with me. I respect both him and his family and understand these differences. Still, I had asked the Yi whether my guy will overcome these objections in the end (so that we may be together at last), and i received17.3 > 49Since not only the culture, but the family culture he is in has a tendency to force their children to submit to their parent's wishes, I was thinking of this answer from the Yi as positive, i.e., moving from the child to the adult and thereby following his own truth and making the necessary transformation.  Just curious whether I am on the right track here.Thanks so much for your time and assistance,modestlearner"

329,"I came across Peak 8 Exercise on the net and decided to adopt it. I have always exercised regularly (yoga, walking, dancing) so Peak 8 doesn't make me exhausted - I wonder if I'm doing it like it should be done when I watch Dr. Mercola gritting his teeth in his demo video on YouTube. So I've raised the resistance level on my stationary bike. Just 20 minutes and the technique makes a lot of sense, but I still don't grit my teeth, although I do pant a bit after the 6th segment. The exercise is supposed to stimulate the production of ""Growth Hormone' which shuts down when you get to 30 (and it's always been around actually).

'retreat' descibes my question, and i indeed feel an impulse to just withdraw and be alone. but is Yi confirming that retreating is recommended, or that i need to retreat from my question -- i.e. retreat from thinking about leaving? i then asked, what if i stay: i got 31 unchanging. can some one help me make sense of these 2 hexagrams?"
333,"Hey everyone.  So I posted a thread awhile back about a great love and connection growing between my best friend and I.I asked ""Are her and I bound so share the fruit of this love that I feel so strongly it must be two ways, or am I just on my own head trip?""  I recieved 5.1 to 48This is the post:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=11387So I led a normal life, waited actively, enjoyed good food and drink, and one day the bubble burst and she was as madly in love with me as I was with her.  We lived in each other's rapture for a good six weeks, until she went home to see her family for xmas.Apparently ALOT of stuff came up, including things about her ex of six years that she left in the summer (tons of reminders around her family's house).So while talking on the phone she said she just can't be romantically involved right now, that she need's to mourn the loss of her ex, and it will be awhile before she can use the words ""i love you"" to anyone.As much as it sucks, I TOTALLY understand this, and feel it's whats best for her (and ergo both of us). I should probably stabilize myself more before entering any sort of anything anyways.Unfortunately this news came at the end of what I can only call a 'psychotic break' (hopefully a 'healing transformation' with hindsight), and I HAD to consult the I ching.I didn't ask a question, I just summoned all my pain and feeling, and asked for insight into the situation.38 tells me about the opposition, or divergent directions we are moving in right now. Romantically, atleast, being that she's moving to her ex and I'm moving to her.   Small matters, success.  Keep focused on building our home, taking care of ourselves and continuing to build our connection as best friends.And ""amidst all fellowship the superior man retains all individuality.""  Months ago when I asked the ching what would happen if I moved in with her I got Heaven->Fellowship.  So the fellowship is here, and I still must retain my on rhythms and lifestyle.""One must cleave from the one with whom he knows he belongs""""Opposition does not preclude all agreement""The third yao is so synchronistically accurate.  Wagon has been haulted, my nose has been cut off.. Sure is a terrible beginning to a great love.And then to 14.  Possession of great measure.  Our connection is bigger and more special than whether or not we can make out, or sleep in the same bed.  I have great respect for her needs in healing, and support them.I feel like the ching is being clear, but I'm paranoid that I'm projecting  wishful thinking, since I've been in a pretty hazy psychological state lately.Anyone validate or correct me?"

We had thought we will overcome the cultural barriers with time. But unfortunately, things deteriorated post april this year, due to immense pressure from his family. The communication reduced, and despite putting up a fight, my partner, started falling weak, and eventually under severe pressure gave into demands of his family and married someone from their community.What hurts me the most, was he never faced me since, he didn't even tell me he got married. In his last mail to me, he said he had no courage to look into my eyes or face me, but he loves me a lot and will never be able to love anyone else ever..... I am devastated, feel at severe loss, feel completely shakened from within.... I have all kind of thoughts running in my mind... and sometimes I think if he even loved me all these years. I don't want to believe that he didn't. For I feel, he would have not waited this long, if he wanted to leave anyway. Please help me understand this, give me some insight, and please let me know, if we have any chance of getting back together again...

342,"Hi,I'm going to be alone for new years. I would like to be able to sleep through it.Anyway, feel ok about it now. Focusing on doing things that look towards my future, but I was upset about it today.I asked the Yi:How can I override my self-pity?31.4,5 > 15I took this to mean seek positive influences and remember you're not the only one suffering. Have some humility, it could be worse, count your blessings. I do feel that now. Plus a lot of people hate new years, pressure to have fun and all, peer pressure, but I would like to be able to share it with someone, preferably my age. As it is, I will spend the majority of the evening, at home with my cat :/ Equally I know that if I hadn't chosen to come home, stayed in China or proceeded to teach somewhere else, or got a job somewhere, I may not have this issue at all. It just brought it home to me that I have built up hardly anything for myself during my life, because I've not succeeded with my peers..31.4 > perhaps reflecting how I've tried too hard, or not hard enough, in the past to influence certain people?

What does it mean?That if we cannot be ourselves, we cannot influence the outside world? Was it expressing that my unconscious mind is upset, and I can't stop that? That it needs an airing?

Ans 62.5 to 31.Normally I read this as needing help from someone that needs to be coaxed into participating.  That could work when referring to the research for my book.  I do have a couple of people who could help but are not always inclined to take the time to do so.  But it doesnt seem to fit in the other things I need to do.  Im wondering if its possible I could be both the king and the one who needs to come out of the cave.  Could it be saying I need to come out of the cave in order to help myself?  Any thought???"
344,"It's a New Year and I want to go into it in the right frame of mind.  Have been trying to hold onto a relationship(all on line - though we talk on the phone and have done for 3 years).  It all stopped 4 months ago when he led me to believe he would visit and pulled out at the last minute.  I did not blame him but he felt we should both move on since he was still not ready to meet me.  I said it will happen in good time but he no longer responds to messages or emails.  I miss him so much.  However, I would move on if that is what is being told of me.I asked about the future of our relationship and got 33 unchanging - retreat which is apt since he has definitely retreated.  I guessed I then was being told to give up.  However, reading lots of threads I see this is not necessarily negative.  Ridiculously I still hold out hope - the intensity of the feeling is still there.  So again I asked a question.I asked will he return to me in 2011 and got hexagram 53 changing to 16 lines 3,4,5 and 6 changing.  It seems postive even though I expected it to be negative.  I am so confused.  Do I start the year and try my best to forget him or do I hold out hope.  Please help me - the interpretation of all these things are pretty difficult and not as the initial word of the hexagram seems to imply!Many thanks."
345,"Hello to you all,New Year approaching and time is fast approaching for my departure from home & job and yes, sorry to bring it up again, but it feels very charged now, my husband.  I asked the I Ching what my most important focus should be in the New Year as I feel so overwhelmed by the so many aspects of loss right now - although I can find peace through meditation.  It gave me 17 with line 6 moving to 25.I have always liked 17 in my brief experience with the I Ching as it somehow gives me the feeling that I can relax in my not knowing and when I panic about not being clear (at all) about my next step, its like 'hey, that's ok, that's how you really can feel & not worry about it...) I cannot seem to make sense of line 6 though and by reading a few past threads it doesn't really get me much further.  Does anyone have any ideas about it that could help me narrow down what my most imortant focus should be.  25 suggests that this is even more of the case of following synchronicity and going with the flow.Would really appreciate some advice from you experienced people and happy new year!Hebe"
346,"I am new to the Iching and I was reading many post and responses. I was wondering till what extent we are  changing our fate sometimes in a negative way, when reading the Iching to understand events. An example,I asked the Iching about a potential reunion with an ex lover and I got 3.2, I searched the posts and found this http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=8855 In this post the reply is clearly negative, when the Iching advises you ""not to accept his offer as he is not the right man"", it is emotionally influencing ourselves that means it is directly influencing our future. We then create in the now a future in our mind that it may have not been the best for us. The future does not exist, the future means possibilities, when we create in present that future with a so clear negative response to an event,  arent we changing our life to worst and limiting our possibilities?I am somehow confused about the way to understand readings. In this case I asked the member that formulated the same question about a potential reunion, what happened with him/her and I am looking forward to receive a reply.Comments welcomed, I would like to understand more,Thank you"

348,"MerryXmas everyone!My emotional challenges are bringing me down again and Im all alone in the city as everyone went to their families for the Festivities. I was watching myself getting ready for another two weeks of depression in bed, as I grabbed the book and started looking for ways out. It turns out it would be a perfect time to finally finish the draft of a book which has been waiting far too long in the drawer. I even already have a publisher and all...! Im a bit all-or-nothing person, so the way i see this being done is actually dying to the outside world and staying inside doing nothing except writing and sleeping and occasionally eating. Literary decadence, my favorite... I asked the YHow to go about this book in order to have it finished until 2011 (one more week, that is)?and got40.1 > 54For me the 40.1 was a clear JUST DO IT. sit write sit write sleep sit write - until its done. But I dont see this sort of deliverance in the context of 54, where nothing should be undertaken. Could it be that 54 is referring to my overall context of frustration beyond the book, how powerless I feel in all other realms? Could it be No problem delivering this, releasing yourself from the tension of having this manuscript laying there for ages, in the bigger picture of tension? Or could it be a sign to halt and just stay in bed feeling sorry for myself...? (no, sorry, kidding, im a bit bitter lately) Could it be a sign to halt, dont attempt to finish the book in the conditions im at at the moment...?Thanks for the helpY"
349,"Recently my best friend has been having some minor problems with one of his best friends back home. He is putting forth, in my opinion, a decent effort to make himself available to his friend, but his friend seems disinterested or distant when they are together. It isn't really a problem at the moment, but it is making my friend feel a little neglected so I asked the Oracle how I could help him in this situation.I cast hexagram 24. As I am a relatively new diviner, I am using the free translation by LiSe Heyboer. My changing line was at the top, which according to Heyboer and Wilhelm doesn't seem too promising, making my transformed hexagram 27.I have gotten pretty comfortable with the Oracle's way of speaking in the few months I have been asking questions, but this changing line has stumped me. It makes the situation sound much more dire than I have been given information from my friend to believe.I am sort of in a hurry to get to bed after having been pondering this for a while. So I apologize if my format is not typical for this forum, I did not feel like taking the time to read a couple posts as I normally would. If any more information would be helpful to shed some light on this changing line I will gladly give it. I also could use some different perspectives on the hexagrams themselves, though I feel they relate to the situation a little easier. Thanks"
350,"Just did an online reading.  Asked if I should give up on my relationship.

352,"Hi everyone,I've never been very good at love. Stuff like 'playing hard to get' or playing it cool, treat them 'mean' keep em keen', etc. Now I know a lot of that is exaggerated, and I'm too nice to treat anyone mean... but am I being 'too nice' - naive? I know in the past I've tended to be more interested in those who give less... I think there are times when I should have held back - I'm too bold with those I'm interested in sometimes. I still don't seem to be getting it (though am caring less when people disappoint me), can't keep those I like interested for long anyway... scare 'em off. Either that or they just haven't been the right 'ones'...I asked yi about someone who I sense is backing off though up till know they've been v friendly. However all via email (My life is lived virtually atm, not least my 'love life' if you can call it that). I might be going to the place where he lives soon so thought I'd suggest meeting up. However I feel he has cooled off and sure enough yi answered:52. Standstill. Consolidating what has come before and bringing it to a stop. (well we don't live near each other, haven't seen him in a long time, but we've sent a lot of emails)I then asked (though inside knew that it didn't matter what yi said because I intend to meet him anyway) to comment on still asking him to meet up anyway:4.2,5,6 > 8I took hex 4 to mean a) unecessary Q b) you can't plan everything out/know in advance, just gotta live and learn it, 8: seek friendship.So I'm going to do that regardless of whether he 'fancies' me or not... which I think not. Think I come across as over-friendly which maybe guys find boring, or over-enthusiastic/predictable... too easy... etc.I then asked if someone I'm not speaking to (the guy I'm estranged from mentioned a lot here) thinks of me:42.1,3,5 > 5252 again! Not sure whether to take the positive lines from 42 as meaning much, or reading the answer as a sentence? ie more energy into standing still; not being affected externally, bringing movement to an end, a strong mountain, unmovable.  As I received 52 twice I asked (to ascertain whether 'stilling' equated to 'no love')'What does 52 equate to re. relationships?'4.3,5 > 574.3 makes me worry... I think I have in the past too eagerly 'thrown myself' at people... but at the same time, at the time I see it as just being friendly, acting naturally... although with the guy I'm now estranged from, I did rely a lot on him, and possibly idealise him...So my main Q is in this thread: Should I be playing a game? Give more respect to the idea of female 'tactics' to keep men interested? That sounds quite base though... but I'm really starting to think there's something in it.... I seem to put people off! Especially the ones I'm interested in...I then asked, Is it my eagerness that switches them off?47.1,6 > 1047 could suggest that my inital approach to having a relationship is wrong... I become too dependant on external validation etc... which stops me from acting sensibly somehow? Whatever that is... I'm really not sure whether I exhaust situations by putting too much into them?? Or whether it's my outlook that sabotages my relationships... and hex 10 is about proper conduct. Apparently it's about a young girl treading carefully after a tiger, then getting a bit over confident or needy, and through impudence, getting herself bitten...But how to be in the driver's seat? I always bat balls away from my court... never the tiger... well most of the time... then there's that problem when you don't like the one that likes you (happens less often though).Any tips and/or interpretations here would be very much appreciated!And happy new year all :bows:Last edited: Dec 29, 2010"
353,"Hi!I drew Hexagram 33 unchanging in regards to an inquiry of whether or not a friend was lying to me.I've felt that she has some issue with me for some time now which she won't talk about but I think it has to do with her feeling jealous and a guy situation. That is why I'm wary of trusting her completely. The issue has to do with her telling me she was robbed the night she was supposed to come to my friends house party. It was very loud and rowdy so noone heard the bell ring and I didn't hear my phone from the other room in time so by the time I noticed her missed calls 20 minutes later, she had already left somewhere else that night. I called to apologize profusely and wanted her to come back that night. She had some of my stuff with me that I forgot at her house a few days prior; my phone, iTouch and some clothes. After that she was impossible to reach. Her phone was off and I contacted her via email and she told me that she was robbed that night.This is what I found online in regardsto Hexagram 33:In hexagram 33 we find that deference to the enemy through a structured retreat is the best path. This is a form of trickery, where we lead the enemy into believing we are retreating, only to return at another more opportune time. Contextually, we combine pulling away (49) with pretending (62), leading to apparent withdrawal. Follow-up hexagrams I cast to clarify the issue further are: Hexagram 16.3 to 62 and Hexagram 49.1.5.6 to 56.Can anyone here help me to decipher this??Much thanks,sibyl"

Question: ""The issue is becoming a LADC counselor (Chemical Dependency Counselor).""I recieved #44 Encountering with changing line of number 5 so it becomes # 50 The Great Bowl. My interpretation is that this is not a light decision. At least not something to enter into without thinking about. I am not sure what line five means.

359,"Hello again!I just had a big misunderstanding (or not) with this man. I think I messed up and I feel horrible. It's all because we communicate with sms and I got it completely wrong (I think) and I told him to don't bother calling me anymore and then he replied that ""if that is what you believe... piss off!"" Just to explain a little what he said: he said -and it is not the first time- that he was just and ordinary man and, even when we had great steamy hot sex he didn't believe why I get so... involved. And I understood that he was telling me ""we have good times together but you better back-off because you are getting too involved"". But when he seemed so upset in his last response I thought that I maybe got it all wrong...I tried to find out if it was just a misunderstanding (sent him sms and then left a message in his voicemail) but he has not responded. I think I blew it up! As I said in my voice message to him, if I just got it wrong I was sorry, I could be stupid sometimes, but if he decided that that was it, then... well, that is how it is. I know I cannot do anything more about it, now it is in his hands. I just got stuck in Hex. 3 that described our relationship in my other post. I feel that all is well somehow, but I don't know if it is because it's better that is over or because it's not over at all. I asked ""why it happened what happened and I received 3.5 to 24. I think I got this one... Then I said to the I ching (without a question): ""I think I really messed it up"" and I received 37.2.3.4 to 10. I didn't get it - perhaps because there was not question.And finally I asked: what he's going to do with our relationship after what happened? and I got 4.1.3.4 to 14.Oh god....! My last question: is there anything left to do from my part to make it work between us? 21 unchanging. I got from this that I can work on getting rid of my attitude, my lack of trust. Yes, I know! But I did it again and I hate myself for it!How he feels about me now? 37.4.6 to 49.  Sorry for so many questions. I have the feeling that I just send to the toilet something that could have been great. And I thought I had it all well done this time.

360,"hi all,i am new to the i ching (relatively), and i am looking for some assistance as well as some feedback.i have been in a very protracted divorce which is taking place overseas where we got married and in a place where neither of us hold citizenship. my ex-spouse is an extremely apt businessman, and i am out of my league. at this point, i have been fighting for alimony for 4 years, and there is a substantial amount of which has been ordered to me, but again my ex has been fighting tooth and nail and appealed and appealed, and now it is in the supreme court in this country. therefore, there is backpay for alimony being held. I am quite anxious as you can imagine. so i asked yi to help me out. here are the questions that i asked (pls, if i did not ask great questions, please feel free to cast question on my behalf as i am still learning):will the court order that i be given the full amount including back payment?38 2.6 > 51will my lawyer be properly prepared?62 2.6 > 50is there anything i can do now to improve the outcome?13 no changing linesis my ex willing to settle now?42 1.5 > 23i may have more questions...it's just been such a long fight. i have minimal resources in comparison, and he is the one who filed for divorce. i keep no blame in my heart, but i do want to stand up for myself and have conditioned my mind that whatever God wants me to have is what i will have, but i should do my part.thanks, modest learner "
361,"Hi, new here. I have received Hex. 35 line 4:Nine in the fourth place means:Progress like a hamster.Perseverance brings danger.Click to expand...on a few occasions over the years and, in the past, the interpretations I read were always that it's like flitting about like a squirrel, i.e., no steadiness, no permanency, which I often just interpreted as a lateral movement that doesn't fundamentally change the situation. Today's interpretation I got online suggests it might be about amassing possessions, ""squirreling"" stuff away:In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places to amass great possessions. But such conduct shuns the light.Click to expand...I get this hexagram at times when I am considering moving to get out of a stagnant situation that has been stagnant for a long time. The two interpretations give completely different answers.  What is your take on this? Anyone."

My instinct tells me he will hurt me - but I've been through this before: I get afraid in a new relationship and tell myself that I'll be heart broken, so it could be fear rather than instinct.I understand that 26 is about fear - 51 about sex.

At that time she didnt give the reason why she withdrew,  but some cover-up explanations. Now, when she has laid it all out, I feel some hesitation towards our relationship, as i feel she could have been more honest, as I feel that I have been lied to for 4 month.Reading Karcher is says:  If you haul your goat along, repenting will disappear. When you hear words dont trust them.Balker and Wilhelm says: If he were led by a sheep, regrets would disappear. He hears the words, but dont trust them. I.e.  the EXACT opposite meaning!One say that I shold act directly and not trust.The others say that I should not lead, but be led, and TRUSTThis is sometimes frustrating with I Ching"

What is my current attitude towards him? 32.5 to 282. What is the I Ching advice about my attitude towards him? 49.4.6 to 373. What is the potential of this relationship? 3 unchanging.4. Where is our relationship headed to if I do the best I can for it? 22.5 to 37and lastly... I couldn't resist asking about his own view of us:5. What can I expect from him? 41.2.3.5 to 37The Hex. 37 seems to be all around and it is quite hard for me to understand it when interpreting a question. Is it about putting things in the right lace?

I asked the Yi what would ultimately come of our relationship now that I had decided to stop our communication? I got 58.1 to 47It's incredibly confusing, as on the one hand with 58.1 there is a fullness of joy and in being aligned to your own inner will, to continue communicating with others and that everything will be okay.  On the other there is 47, offering a sense of exhaustion and depression, and that whatever I have to say has no effect on others - that in fact, I'm headed for a lot of loneliness and that I need to prepare for that (I read 47.1 for further understanding and it confused me even more...)

377,"Hi everyone, almost one month after this reading, I am really learning about the nature of 5 WAITING/NOURISHMENT and specially, as we had already interpreted, how painfully slow waiting in the sand/mud can get. Just out of curiosity, 2 weeks ago things were again difficult and again I asked ""How should I be acting in order to bring us closer?"" and again I got exactly 5 (2,3) > 3But this month was not only difficult and slow. We did get closer, our intentions towards each other are getting clearer, and we spent time together, performed together, got to know each other. So all in all, a good process. He does boycott every chance to be alone in a room, because once I told him ""we should be talking about what is going on between us"". He agreed and looked excited about it, but now he flees every single opportunity. I feel he likes me a lot, but either he is overly shy, in love with someone else who keeps me on a short leash, or has a problem of a nature one cannot expect... This Sunday we said we would have dinner at my place. He wants to cook and looks all excited about it. As things turn quite fast with this guy, I looked for reassurance with the Y on how to stand until Sunday, as I am very busy and probably would not get in touch nor meet him anywhere. What steps should be taken towards him in the next days to get us closer?60 (2) > 3I read a clear - do something! We dont have a date or anything scheduled till Sunday, but I feel the Y is urging me to... go out and look for him? I know where he will be Friday night, I could pass by uninvited... but feels so much like pushing it... Or could it be refering to Sunday, where I should finally step forward our endless gate and talk about feelings? Ok, confused about the nature of these action I asked for clarification, ""You say its time to act, but what can I do?""5 (2,3,4) > 17So, back to 5.2 and 3, now with the addition of 4....! great, stuck in a pit... Dont these sound contradictory? On the one hand DO SOMETHING, get out of the gate, dont stay inside, and on the other hand WAIT, you are stuck, there is nothing you can do...It is true that 5 and its difficulties have been a perfect mirror of how things have been happening between us. There is something unclear about his reservations, some sort of secret that holds him away from me. But he does like me, I feel it. There must be a way to reach this guy...Be proactive (60.2) or wait patiently for the overwhelming obstacles to dissolve (5.4)?Thank u!!"
378,"Hi,I'm in the throes of finishing a relationship of a year and a half.  It's been exciting and different and has engaged me fully which is a great thing for me.   I'm very upset by information that's recently come to light, and we separated a few days ago with plans to meet at the end of the month - he wants the relationship to continue, and I typically stay in touch with ex's.  The rational part of me knows that going our separate ways is for the best however am caught in the emotional maelstrom.  I asked the Yi, how can I get completion/closure around this relationship, and received 24 unchanging.   Just back off, meditate & chill out?  With potential of relationship renewing?The Hex speaks of cycles, but also regaining balance - the benefits of which are obvious.   The advice of a return to normalcy brings up sadness as normalcy has included loving this man.  I read in another post that it refers to the Winter Solstice which this year falls almost on an eclipse, which in certain camps signals momentous change, so perhaps I just hang out & see what the astrological fates have in store for me...Thanks for any insight on this one."
379,"I asked the Yi some months ago about what to expect during the 2012 solar storm NASA has announced recently and got Hex. 5 lines 5 and 6 moving to 26. Then yesterday, having forgotten I had already asked, I asked again and got hex 5 unchanging. I suppose I'm being told to live in the moment, do my best and not worry and all will end well. And 26 speaks of improving one's character through the advice of ancient sages. I can see my spiritual path here. This is the preparation suggested in the hexagram. 5 also has to do with storing energy, virtue or material things. Any thoughts?"

381,"As it's the Winter Solstice combined with an eclipse, I thought today would be a good time to ask, 'What is coming up for me in the year ahead'.  Yi responded, Hex 15, Lines 1,3 & 6 changing to 27.  Lisa's Line 1 says,'words are stronger than weapons if one seeks peace.'  One of my goals in the coming year is to work on developing communication and public speaking skills - this seems to fit.  Line 3 to me means, 'Be. Do. Have.'  Line 5 talks about resonating with others emotionally (I think) resulting in support for projects.  This would be fantastic as I've recently gone on leave from my job and am working on setting up a new business.  Line 1 also talks about avoiding 'war' through 'exchanging goods and sports'.  There seem to be veiled warnings about power struggles/conflicts, along with advice to develop skills and awareness to avoid these.I found an old post where dobro stated that 15 to 27 refers to 'humbling illusions and vain imaginings in a way that truly nourishes you.'  Reality check?I would love to get further insights on this somewhat auspicious reading -- I get the sense I will be 'taken care of' if I stay emotionally grounded and present to the needs of others."

390,I'm looking for a buyer for my house and have one estate agent working on it. I asked the Yi what are the chances of a certain deal coming through and got hex 17 with changing lines 1 and 2 moving to hex 47. Doesn't line 1 contradict line 2? Is the Yi saying that I should look for another agent? And is 47 pointing to my anxiety or something else? I'm not really anxious.Many thanks for your help.BestCirce

394,"Hello!  I am new to this forum and actually discovered it researching a paper I was writing on the I Ching.  Well, I finished my paper, but as part of my paper I asked the I Ching for guidance on what it wanted to say.  I threw hexagram 56 The Traveler or Wanderer, with no changing lines, the fire trigram atop the mountain.  I took it to mean illumination through stillness and no need to travel anywhere, but inward.  In light of that ::wink::wink::, I decided a few hours later to do another reading on a dream I'd had a few nights ago.  Now, a little background on my dreams.  They are usually quite vivid and epic in proportion.  This most recent dream wasn't so epic, but is was just as vivid.  Now, in the dream, I was aware that I was dreaming, or lucid dreaming.  I stepped outside my front door (I live in the southwestern United States, Sonoran Desert) and directly in front of me was Stonehenge.  It was glowing from some inner radiance.  I wanted to go toward it, but for some reason couldn't move.  I turned around and the house was gone.  I was standing in this muddy path.  I heard the sound of horses.  I found myself suddenly face down in the mud, unable to move and looked up to see riding down this mountain black knights on black horses.  I was a bit afraid, since I couldn't move, but since I knew it was just a dream, I wasn't too worried.  So, I waited for them to either trample me or pass by.  Well, they passed by in single file, avoiding me, though seemingly unaware that I was even there.  They were headed in the direction of Stonehenge (I think, though I couldn't tell since I was facing the opposite direction face down in the mud.).  In any case, when I asked the I Ching about what it was important for me to understand about the nature of my dream, I got the exact same hexagram with no changing lines.  Now, any thoughts on this?  Can it be that there is an underlying theme to my life at the moment that will influence anything I do and that is why I got the same hexagram twice?  Any more thoughts on this would be tremendously helpful and much appreciated.  Many Thanks!Jenna"

396,"Hello,So my girlfriend left me after a relationship of almost 8 years. She said I haven't done anything wrong but she doesn't have any feelings for me.I've been thinking a lot about this relationship and I would like to take this breakup to improve myself. Because to me, when a couple breaks up, both have a responsibility in this failure.So I ask : What can I do to improve myself, what wrongs have I done?I got 29.1.6 > 61""Repeated dangers"" and ""Bound with good rope and cords. For three years, gains nothing. Pitfall"" leading to Inner Truth.So I interpret this as I've made the same mistake again and again, but I can't do nothing to correct it and that is my true self. I have yet to find this repeated faulty behavior.Or another interpretation is that I should not protect myself so much, put myself more in danger. I tend to hide my good deeds, because that would show me as a weak person. My ex knows it and accepted it. Maybe she would like to have a more shiny boyfriend, but I prefer to stay humble and not to show off.Well, I would like some insights from the communityThanks in advance."
397,"Hello peopleTwo years ago I decided to quit my commercially challenging job as an hr consultant because of a burnout. Back then I wanted to do domething else with my life, travel the world and maybe go back to school, to be who I wanted to be in stead of being part of the daily rat race. Soon after I quit that job I realised I was up to my ears in debt and that all my big dreams of studying and travelling where out of the question. Since then I dealt with a depression on a personal level and I am still dealing with the financial hangover that was partly responsible for my recent depression. After several temporary jobs and alot of dissapointments I decided to apply once again for my old job, partly out of financial necessity and partly because I wanted to face my old fear for personal failure. After a tence month of waiting for their answer I got some very positive feedback and before i knew it I was back in my new job. After a difficult start and some confrontations with old colleagues I finally feel more certain of my position at work and myself as a person. Still, my job depends on my results at the end of each month and my boss has high expectations for me because of my excellent results in the past. The pressure is high and I feel up to the challenge, but still, some insecurity is gnawing at the far ends of my new found confidence. I decided to ask the Yi How am I evolving in my new job? Hexagram 8 line 5 changing to hexagram 2.Seems to me like the Yi is telling me that, if I stay true to my ethics and do my job with the drive that is necessary to succeed, the rest will follow naturally.I would love to read about other peoples take of this reading With loveJoke"

It's been quite a year, and in short - I've been through a re-birth of sorts.  (No religious connotation there.)My post relates to an ex whom I believe (know) is my twin flame.  It's been almost two years since our (most recent - second of two) split and I'm still deeply attached/in love with him.  Recently, we've reconnected (much to my surprise) on a social networking website.  I believe we are both quite confused/scared about what to do now.(For the record, I do not have issues with letting past lovers/partners go.)The first question I asked:How should I deal with X?  I received 24.1.2.5 > 29I wrote an email (prior to throwing Iching and after further digging gave the appearance that he may be dating someone at the moment) apologizing for seeking him out when he is with someone, wishing him the best/happiness, telling him that he was the love of my life, nobody compares to him and never will, and when I think of him it still takes my breath away, and letting him know that I'd be deleting him from the networking sight - but only because I thought he'd delete me first for writing him like that, but I just had to be honest - because our break up was a bit mean spirited and we did some hurtful things to each other, and I wasn't sure I'd ever have the floor with him again.  (note:  it's been a couple of days and we have not deleted each other.  he also hasn't responded.)I then asked:  Does X need me to say any more than I have to him?  I received 1 unchanging.

It has been three years now and despite the fact that I moved 10 months ago to a place 2 hours away from him, he still manages to prevent me from moving on, constantly trying to discuss endless issues regarding our son.

417,"Hi Guys,I have been dating this guy (B) for a 4-5 months and I have now reached a point where I feel a bit stuck.  I am unable to actually specify why I feel this way, whether it has something to do with my past bad experience, with fear of getting attached again and being disappointed or whether my intuition is telling me to step back (for whatever reason).  This guy has been bending himself backwards right from the start, buying flowers, coming over every evening, sending loving text messages, gifts etc and I don't know if it's the intensity of it (he has already mentioned he would like us to move in together in the new year) that made me have second thoughts (he wanted to know after 2 months if I loved him) or the fact that there are issues in his life I am just not so sure about (he seems to drink quite a lot, he apparently works for himself but I don't see him actually doing that much) or am I just picking on little things (he wears socks full of holes! and his shoes are never clean...) trying to uncover something bigger???.

We've never talked about an obvious attraction that happened between as a few months ago, I'm not sure how he sees me but I find myself drawn to this person.Now, I have had a crush on him since then and, with sorting out my relationship problems and trying to figure out if it's worth  trying to keep it going (the situation is pretty complicated, as they almost always are  ), I spend a lot  of time thinking about him and wondering if he shares any of his feeling for me. So I asked the following questions: Does he share my feelings? 31 Influence, line 3 to 45 GatheringIs he romantically interested in me? And got 24 Returning, no changing lines. The explanation sounds pretty positive, but the image is very confusing (closing the borders at winter solstice)What is he feeling about me? 17 Following, lines 3 and 5, changing to 55 Abundance. The explanations of hex 55 I've read vary a lot and I can't make a conclusion out of it.What does he want with me? I got 31 Influence, lines 1&5 (influence in toes and shoulders) changing to 55 Abundance again..I'm sorry for posting all these questions, I would really, really appreciate some help in shaping a little clearer picture.Thank you!!!"
420,"Hi,I'm new to this forum, so hello to all and thank you in advance.  This year has been a tough one with some unexpected changes - one, I have been searching for work for nearly a year, and two, I recently broke off with an intended life partner.The relationship is now quite bitter, with the two of us barely keeping in touch. However, we were and are very in love to this day, strangely.  Only we cannot seem to overcome difficulties in our communication and distance spent apart. Although we were living together, my partner spent 90% of the time in their home country with family.  I believe a lot of it was out of sheer fear at being in a new country. I tried to be patient, but it was very stressful for me, and my partner did not seem to accept or understand my difficulty with this situation after a year. By the time they could accept some of it, a lot of damage had been done to our trust and we both had said a lot of hurtful things.  I was hoping to get some clarification on whether or not there was any hope of reunion before moving on to questions concerning my job situation. I asked the Yi: What steps can we take to start this relationship anew?I received Hex 27.2.4 to 38My assumption here is that in the first hex represents how we nourish others and ourselves, and being careful.  I have also seen the image of spreading seeds in the spring  in regards to this hex and I would be interested in what others feel about this.  This makes me think of preparing the way for a time of blossoming and cultivation of the better parts of ourselves. But lines 2 and 4 tell different stories, and seem in opposition... In line 2, I sensed that I should not become distracted and miss my goal of ""reaching the summit""? But also there is some indication that taking the help of others is like taking the easy way out and could be damaging...And in line 4, I read that I have the drive and desire to reach this goal, but should keep my eyes peeled for people to help me.These two lines seem to say opposite things, so I would love some insight.  This was my interpretation so forgive any incorrect assumptions... And hex 38 I felt clearly and correctly indicated estrangement. Although it can also indicate a sense that opposites can exist in unity (fellowship and individuality can coexist), i.e. Heaven and Earth, etc.  I also interpreted it to mean that if I take care of the small things, and work incrementally, there is hope for reaching my goal after a time.  Any thoughts?Thank you,Blu7"
421,"Hi everybody! First of all, I'd like to apologize for my english, which is not the best since it's not my native language. I'm pretty new to I Ching, and I decided to ask the Yi about my situation, because I struggle with self-doubts. Basically I take paid lessons in order to get better in a business I try to make a living from later on. Actually I've made some strong improvements during the last months, but I don't feel very confident with my abilities and questioned the positive result of my efforts. Therefore I decided to ask the Yi, and I have asked the following question: How will my situation develop, when I'm focus on achieving my goal? I got: Hex 2.5.4.1.>17I'm just sit here for three days now, made lots of notes and try to extract a relevant ""message"", but all of my interpretations are filled with wishful thinkings and almost blinded me. Therefore I was searching for a forum with people who are not involved and have more experience with the I Ching than I have. Hopefully, some of you can tell me what they think about this constellation regarded my question. Thank you very much for reading. FangsandClaws (Kendall)"

Because I just feel that he has commitment issue. He has had almost 10 gf, all long term, but he's still not married. He kept telling me he's trying to find the right woman, but for me, it just seems like he's having trouble to commit. It really makes me insecure about this relationship.

In a way I felt he came out of curiosity to be sure he still felt the same, whereas I still do feel the same, but something prevented me from answering the knock.

There is a progression of events in the changing lines so here is how the story goes:If a few people are complaining there will come a time where the truth will be known. I based this on line 1 & 2.  Line 4 suggests that things are going to change. The company will not be able to keep doing what it was doing before. There is or will be a downfall. Line 6 suggests to me that there will be a change in upper management.

But he has an inner relationship with a superior man, and through this he attains the stability to free himself from the way of the inferior people around him.

Time will change the impact of these problems, and starting late next year or the year after removes these issues, but as I am not that far from reaching the age of last hope for children I feel I don't have time to squander. It's a very delicate situation, and so I hope you will forgive me if you find this tedious.There are three possible options, and I'm not sure which one would be the best path..

446,"Well, things have really slowed for my real estate business here.  With the economy overall and the health problems I've faced, I think it's time to make a change.  A big one.  So, I've applied for a few jobs out of state (getting a fresh start away from the ex would be good) and wondered about this one in particular.  It would be a training director position for a property management company.  I thought that if offered that job, I could also live in one of their properties, which solves two problems for me right away - I have a job and a place to live in a new city.I wondered about if I'd get the job and if I did, how would it go.  So, I asked Yi, ""If I get the job and move into X community, what will my life be like?"" and received 24.1 > 2.  I think the IC is telling me that this is taking me back to the path that I'm supposed to be on.  It appears that I've stepped off, but it is time to return.  I need not look back on the past with remorse, but be strong and move forward here.  I think I'm also supposed to be receptive to new ideas, but I'm not certain what that refers to here.  Could that mean that I might not get this job, but something else?I also asked, ""Will they pay me what I'm looking for?"" and received 25.1 > 21.  I believe this casting reflects what's happened to me over the past year, the health problems (a/k/a ""affliction"") and that there's no blame in it.  I will grow beyond the problems I've had and be successful here.  Could it also mean that taking this job, being in the new city and new place will also help to heal me as well?  Is that what you see, or am I missing something?If all goes well and I get paid what I want here, I'm gonna get a puppy.  There is one I have been approached about taking, who could be a little rock star in the show ring.  I'm excited about the potential here with this little guy and starting a new life somewhere else.  I hope that all of this comes together soon!  Thanks for your input on my casting - I appreciate it!"
447,"Hello,I've had a series of unchanging hexigrams when I've asked the I ching about a ""friendship"" that I have. It's a bit frustrating, so I thought I would post it here and see what you think. Basically I think the series of unchanging hexigrams is I Ching saying that there is pretty much little I can do (which I what I have thought about the situation). But because of the hexigram 42.6 >3 I got in the ""your personal I ching reading"" forum I was worried that I was being given a warning relating to my friend. The situation: my friend, who I know through a past work event, moved across the world to the city where I live a year ago. He asked and I gave advice on jobs and moving etc, and since he has arrived we have spent time together (along with our partners) and done social things together. My friend is fun and a very gregarous kind of person - but unfortunately not at all able to return phone calls/reply to emails when invited to events. He is constantly VERY late, commits to overseas travel trips but then never replies or gives an indication he can't come anymore, and has done a whole series of things.  For example, he asked for a packet of sweets from our home country when I was travelling there and I got them for him. But a text message from me telling him I had them and would love to give them to him and catch up sometime soon was completely ignored. No response. AT ALL. He became really hard work, and I saw no point in it. So a few months ago I stopped have anything to do with him (not with malice just a retreat). However, on the weekend he initited contact and said he wanted to come to a dinner I had organised (despite not RSVPing when I quite nicely invited him in Oct). This was on THE DAY of the dinner, so I was quite annoyed. But I told him of the correct time and place. At 6pm (an hour and a half before the dinner) he said they would give the dinner ""a miss but how about catching up for a beer on monday or tuesday night"".I was quite angry, and didn't reply to that text. I resolved not to have much to do with him - it may seem a petty responce but this is the latest in a whole series of incidences that I have found distressing and very annoying.  I asked the I ching: Explain the situation with x (my friend) = 18Deep seated behaviours that are grounded in his upbringing (which makes excellent sense) and also I imagine this relates also to my own upbringing. That  I am the unmovable and unflexible force that has come up against his more free movement (and considerations of time!)I asked what would be the outcome if I had little to do with x (my friend) = 40Very clearly - the relaxation of bonds. I would feel free from the binding of this (quite hard work and frustrating) person. How would the superior person act towards x ( my friend) = 24Allowing friends to come and go without judgement. I also wonder if this is the I ching saying ENOUGH ALREADY!Phew! What a missive!I would be very appreciative for any thoughts. "
448,"This reading has already met its outcome, I am sharing just out of sheer amazement to the Ys response. I cant really make any link between 24 unchanging and what actually happened, maybe u could suggest something?I entered a theatre-game where we have to improvise according to topics that are drawn from the audience in the very moment, so I have no way to prepare. It was a light-hearted experience, I was not so much concerned with my performance, but out of curiosity I asked before-hand:""To which random topic will I have to improvise on?"" and got 24 unchanging.Through the day I had my head exploding with associations and possible arguments and movements to use in case some of my interpretations met the topic, but it turned out to be something completely out-there.

(or so it seems to me given last exchange of mails and short-texts...) In a way its beautiful : I am standing in front of the abyss. I am at this sublime threshold of life in which I can still  (with immense effort!!!) choose to put a stop to it now - and walk away. I know myself, I have a deep way to surrender, and if this thing carries on and he is really just playing me, I am in for a long pain-processing journey... So, I asked about the potential as a fixed romantic partnership (as in, not just an enounter) 5 : 2,3 > 3If I wait something will happen. Thats the main idea I got from this. I dont understand if 3 relates to NOW, the difficulties we are facing in sprouting, or after. It could mean we will get together but we wont last much longer then early beginnings, as robbers and enemies will come (5.3)So something does happen if I wait (5.2) but its not long lasting and it will put me in a position of danger?OR, (my heart likes this one much better) if Im mindful of the early difficulties and aware of how dangerous and female-surrounded this guy is, good fortune comes in the end.But basically I should wait and mind the danger, right?I dont see any sign to walk away nor retreat.Looking fwd to hearing your thoughts,Yoana"

Recently I have been learning I Ching in order to help me understand what kind of patterns and energies are shaping myu world but alas, I am still very new and have a lot of trouble understanding it all.Today I consult the I Ching about  how I should deal with my feelings concerning my past and my feeling about my ex-wife and this is what i got 32.4 > 46.Can anyone give me some understanding?  The changing line is especially confusing...Thank you."
454,"Hello everyone. I am in a relationship, six months now. In the last few weeks I have had some doubts, I don't know if I should continue with this. I love him and he loves me, but I feel we are in a crisis (already???) All this makes me think (and I think a lot, believe me) that maybe we should end it before we get hurt. Well, I asked the I Ching What should I do? and I got 14.1 changing to 50.I also asked what is going to happen between us? and I got 42.3 changing to 37.Could you please help me understand?Thank you so much"
455,"Thank you all for help on my recent thread on modesty, now I have unfortunately another situation on my hands that I need help with. This involves my boyfriend who recently left me for another girl and just decided to come back to me. I am obviously being very cautious but I do love him and want to work things out. I am just having major trust issues going on inside me. I feel insecure bout my position (being a sucker) and feel like he could very well do this again.I asked the I ching is he going to leave me again for another girl? 40.1.4-->19it seems the iching thinks so? I am the big toe?Is he here to stay for good (meaning has he found what he wants in me)?40.6-->64does this talk about him removing me for good (am I now the hawk?) or it is a ""bull's eye"" meaning this is what he wants?is he dating around behind my back? 6.3-->44I am at a loss with this but the 44 rings loud alarm bells for meand I am probably beating this to death but I asked am i the only one he wants to be with now? 32 unchanging, if he considers me ""the one"" 53.6-->39, and if he loves me and got 42.1.2-->4 I feel like some are good sign but the other readings are throwing me off and the hex 4 in the last reading...am I being ignorant?, Can anyone look at this picture of readings and tell me honestly if this looks bad as I think. I know I have jealousy issues anyways that I am trying to work on and don't want to voice to him just yet so I don't know if these fears are all in my head or not. any help is appreciated..."
456,"Question: Am I ready to date? Please give me insight into romance.. (Am I ready, what should I look for, how should I be acting?) These lines are new to me, and I am having trouble understanding what lines 5 and 6 are telling me, as these to be somewhat contradictory. Any help?"
457,"Hello,Time has passed and my husband is leaving on Jan 18th for his flight to NZ and then his cycle back to UK in time.  Given a date the grief, as he's not committing to coming back necessarily, is really hitting home now - and he is going down to tell my parents this Sunday.  I am still in limbo in finding a plan of my own yet & although I have support here, I will still be losing my home & job.  Something is in the way to my being able to find the next step & I don't know what it is.  I Ching advised my next step after his leaving as 1 - line 2, which I will do. (seperate question probably).  But as this is breaking my heart, I finally asked the I Ching 'how will this seperation affect our marriage?' and got hexagram 27 lines 1 & 3.  I found a good thread about this specifically on relationships but with 2 different interpretations - and my own feeling is now one of pure fear as I have such a deep love for him and am terrified that he is throwing something away without realising what he is doing - 'grass is greener'.  But it could also be that I am not willing to look at my own independence.What do you think?  I just want to get this right - both my next steps and do whatever I possibly can to help this marriage which deep down I don't think is in trouble & now because of this risk, it could be. With appreciation for any insights, Hebe"
458,"Hi all,My teacher was asking if I like to help in a conflict he's having- its regarding his lively hood (being mostly people trying to ruin his reputation).

460,"Hi Guys,I have not posted for a long while, partly because my life has been in turmoil for a long time and because I just couldn't think straight.  I still can't....Anyway, a few months ago a met a new man who is now proposing to move in together (well, to move in to his house with my 4 year old son)... After last relationship disaster I am petrified of making another committment and so have become increasingly more distant...  Tonight I have plucked up the courage to ask ""What if my son and I move in with X?"" What do you make of 56.5 to 33 response?  Is it me being paranoid or is it not very positive?? (well, line 5 kind of is... but not sure about the rest) Please help me you wise people....(BTW when I first met him Hilary did a reading for me back then (about the potential for this relationship) with the resulting hexagram being 56)"

462,"I recently met someone who I am really interested in.  Well, had a couple of dates, seemed to go well.  I'm wondering if there will be another one, and I was thinking I might need to initiate by asking him out.  So asked the I-Ching what the outcome would be if I asked him out,and got Hex 36.1<15.  I feel like if I ask him out, I'm going to get ""humbled"" or rejected.  Then again, I've asked the I-Ching several questions about the potential of this relationship.  I keep getting Hex 15...it seems positive, but then does it mean that I'm just going to get humbled by the whole experience?  I can take rejection, I feel like I have nothing left to lose anymore by making a move.  Anyone else have insight?Hex 36 sort of says to me that I need to wait it out, but I'm confused...Maybe I need to wait for him to make the move?Last edited: Nov 22, 2010"

464,"Hi. I have looked in the archives and need to ask for you guys to help. I met this man and have a great time together. He seems to like me as well as I like him, however I met him through an ex-boyfriend who is getting married in December. This man is concerned our friend, the ex, will be upset/mad as he is in the wedding party. He said last we talked about it that maybe it would be better if we waited until after the wedding. He has now stopped all communication. I guess because we had such a connection I am now wondering if anything will come of it or I should just forget it. So I asked,How does he feel about me? 55.2 to 34What will be the outcome of our relationship? 6Any thoughts would be great and very much appreciated. Thank you in advance."
465,"RE: To take or not to take the job, that is the questionHello all,The last time I was here on this forum, was all the way in Feb. That was when everything that could go wrong in my life was going wrong and I was in depression. I posted a reading ""What should I do to feel peaceful and calm now?"", with results Hexagram 44.2.4.6 to 39. Many of you were very generous in you advice. I am very grateful and tried working on them, going out more, mingling more, engaging myself in more activities.Now, almost 10 months on, I've marched on and there's a new guy in my life and career-wise is also looking up.  But here's the glitch, I've only started on this new relationship, it's a very young relationship so I'm protective of it. Of course, we're still in the honeymoon period so everything is lovey dovey.  But this new job I'm being offered, while sounding very exciting, is demanding and will require me to travel quite often, sometimes 2-4 weeks on end.I'm afraid. I'm not young any longer and having found someone who loves me so much, I don't want to lose him because I'm always flying for my job. So I asked the following 2 questions:1) How will joining company XXX affect my relationship with O?Hexagram 28.2.3.4.6 --> 202) If I want the relationship between O and I to grow and blossom, should I take the job at company XXX?Hexagram 14.1.4.6 --> 46Wow.... 4 lines changing (28.2.3.4.6) for the 1st reading. And frankly, out of the 4 changing lines, 2 sounds ominous. The way I interpret it was that the ridgepole represents the relationship between O and I. So initially, things will still go well between O and I (Line 2, shoots sprouting) but then the travelling will start wearing our relationship thin (Line 3 ridgepole sags to breaking point). Then something happens to resuscitate our relationship (Line 4 ridgepole is braced) but in the end, with all the travelling and neglect, our relationship still ends (Line 6 water over the head).But looking at the 2nd reading (14.1.4.6), things look so much more positive. It seems to tell me in Line 1 that if I am mindful of the difficulties, there is hope. Line 4 stumped me a little, but I like Line 6, because it seems to tell me that the relationship between O and I will blossom.So I'm confused, because these 3 readings seem to conflict each other and well, I doubt my ability to read the hexagram and changing lines accurately. (This is also why I try not to meddle too much with the other readings in the forum coz I don't wanna give wrong interpretations and advice and screw up. ) So here I m, asking humbly for any advise and interpretations on these 2 readings. :bows: Please do help, coz I'm just hopelessly in love now.

466,"This is quite strange.My interest in a certain dead entertainer started about 10 days ago.  I never had an interest in this person before.  In fact, I didn't even know who he was.Now, 10 days later, I'm an expert on his life and I can't stop thinking about him.  I'm fighting the urge to launch a website about him.  I don't see any good ones out there and it feels like something I want to do, which seems crazy.I can see absolutely no reason why I should be this interested in him.  His niche in the entertainment world was one I never bothered engaging with.  So, I'm struggling to understand this and turned to the yi,Why can't I stop thinking about this person?The answer was 61.1.2 > 20.Wilhelm's commentary on line 1 talks about ""secret ties"" and line 2 talks about hidden cranes calling out from the shade. Hilary's translation says that ""there is a another, no peace"".  The relating hexagram, 20, is about viewing, observing.  I suppose this would represent what I'm doing, the viewing.What about 61.1.2 though?  It's interesting that line 2 talks about wine and this person in life was an alcoholic.  It also talks about ""spiritual attraction"".  So, I'm spiritually attracted in some way to this person, the dead alcoholic?  That sounds very ""out there"" to me.  I need some help with this one."

468,"Recently I have  been curious and interested in the idea of Thought Vibration and Remote Influence. Long story short,  I had a dream about a person I have barely ever had contact with, and funny enough they got in touch with me the very next day. Now when I say remote influence, I don't mean mind control or anything like that. More of the idea that if someone is open and receptive to accept energy and opinion, you can ""nudge"" them with your mind. The whole theory is a lot more complex and scientific, but I am trying to keep this as concise as possible.Anywho, I asked if the situation was merely just a coincidence or if it was somewhat provoked through the dream and got 14.5. Wilhelm says ""He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified, has good fortune.""I intepret it somewhere along the lines of those who believe are believed, if that makes any sense haha. I am very interested to hear opinions on this one."
469,"Hi,One would think I could/should move on from this weird/funny/upsetting relationship that I have questioned in my previous threads but all of a sudden I find my self sitting there with what feels like a confused frown on my face and heartfelt feelings for this man.One moment I think there is no way I would even talk to him again let alone anything else and the next moment I have a very strong desire to be with him...what tha?This has gotta be the most confusing thing I have ever experienced in my life I can't recall a time where I have suddenly found my self sitting there feeling quite perplexed, you know right in the middle of doing something else.

470,"It's the same situation with the same person I have posted previous threads about....sometimes I wonder why I allow myself to remain in this situation with them. Out of curiosity, I asked ""what is the purpose behind this person being in my life?"" and got 25.1.2.3.4>57 as the answer.With four changing lines, I tried looking at the two hexagrams and just taking in the images of the changing lines....I am a bit lost. Not entirely sure how to read this.Hexagram 25 is about the unexpected, remaining natural, disentangling, and of course innocence and hexagram 57 is about a gentle/gradual permeation...penetrating to the root of the issue but with a light touch.I don't know...I just don't see what yi is trying to tell me.I also asked ""why do I allow this person to remain in my life?"" and got 52.4>56 as the response.This is a prime example of yi not responding to my answers directly but instead giving me advice.Maybe the answers are the same to these questions...if I am not happy, then maybe I should (25) disentangle myself gradually and gently(57) by keeping my heart still (52.4) and move on like the wanderer (56).If anyone has any ideas i would greatly appreciate hearing them.Namaste"

473,"As many of you here on Clarity have walked alongside of me this past year as I have been on a journey of rediscovery, I thought I'd share the latest casting with you.  A little back story to put this one in context, though...The previous (bad) relationship I was in for 7.5 years was with a man who was a narcissist, one who went into nuclear meltdown mode anytime my focus was on anything that wasn't about him.  He was very controlling and, well, a total loser and a waste of my time.  (That's easy to say a year after breaking up with him.)  I lost a lot of my identity and disconnected from friends and things that meant the most to me - things that brought me joy.  I know, I know, you're all saying to yourselves the same things I am now.  Why?  Was he worth all that I gave up?  Nope.  Not even close.  But that's what happens in abusive relationships, sadly.So, I am in the process of rediscovering myself and all those things that make living so worthwhile.  It's like Christmas morning each day as I open a new gift I give myself.  In this case, I don't mind the re-gifting!  LOL!!  I think my connection with my friend Rodney has opened my eyes and reawakened my passion for music once again (he's a musician).  So, even if he and I never have that romantic relationship I hope for, I am grateful that he entered my life to help me find that part of myself again.  I am now seriously thinking of getting back into a choir and I'm once again singing along with some of my baroque-period and opera favorites as I play them on my ipod.  That's something I haven't done on a regular basis for years.  Keep in mind, I come from a family where music filled the home and I either sang or played a musical instrument since age 9.  Every family member had a musical talent and every once in a while, Mom and I will still have our own ""jam session""s (she at the piano, accompanying me while I sing).  Needless to say, the ex was never around when we did that, as it would be ""stupid"" or ""boring"" as it wasn't about him.At the college level, I had my choir classes paid for by one group's director at one point, as he needed me in his ensemble as his strong 2nd Soprano even after I transferred to another university.  I totally dig the classics (especially chamber and baroque period music) and have sang in groups ranging in size from 12 to 250 members and loved every minute of it.  I am starting to see how I sacrificed so much and got nothing in return.  As money is tight, I am worried about spending any unneccessarily.  However, I have an opportunity to get season tickets to the symphony orchestra and a series of ""Off-Broadway"" musicals.  I'd be spending just under $1,000 for two seats for 12 shows (from September - April).  So, I asked my trusty friend, the IC, ""Should I buy season tickets to both the musicals and symphony?""  And got 11.2.5 > 63.I think Yi is telling me that it is a risk that can be taken at this time, but I need to be realistic about my resources.  However, in some other interpretations I see 11.2 as that I must stay determined on my continued path in order to make the transition from my previous way of living (without music, under the ex's control) to that of emotional fulfillment, as apparently there will be those who don't want me to better myself.  I love how 11.5 mentions living in harmony - so appropriate here.  I think the IC is telling me that this is the right thing to do, as it will bring me happiness and set the stage (so to speak) for future growth in my life.  Such an auspicious line.I put the Hex 63 in the context of slamming the metaphorical door shut on the ex, who dictated what our social calendar was when we were together.  Now it is up to me to make the decisions over what I will do for fun and entertainment.  However, I've also seen in other interpretations that I am to prepare for the worst and hope for the best (possibly financially)?  Could it mean that I go for the lowest priced option and save the remaining funds in case times are tough for me financially and I need the money later?  I'm confused here.I appreciate your insight on this fun casting.  I've got Handel playing as I type this, as I'm in the mood to hear a live performance now!  "
474,"I asked....Will a romance happen between me and C (my friend at work) -  i was given the Marrying Maiden...again, on both sides.wondering if this is something again, like last year....always coming in as a ""mistress"" do not want that...this is a special friend that we actually met in august - it has been up/down, between us.  much sexual tension and wonderful talks and lunches together, out for a late dinner one time, we were scheduled to go out again this saturday, but he had a change in plans....please help to better understand this Hex.

479,"Hi everyone,One of the lessons learned from my recent experience in a small enclosed community where I got this forum's valuable support to solve my lack of clarity was that I am overall lacking a symbolic family. My tribe, so to say. I managed to flee that community I was at, and now back to the city the overwhelming sense of disconnection-isolation takes the best out of me again. In the middle of all this I received an invite to participate in a literary/performative project, around a topic im not so close to, but for which meanwhile I had some ideas which were exciting for me creatively.Specially the guy who invited me... I admit I would realllllly like to have a chance to work next to him ...and he shows a lot of interest that I send something in by tomorrow, the deadline for proposals.Through the week I drafted a lot of proposals and always the Y gave me the feedback ""wait"", ""not ready yet"" and twice of 26 (Big Constraint)...  Last night I had a flash of inspiration and solved what I thought were the weaknesses of the previous proposals, and now feel super enthusiastic about sending this version to him tomorrow, and being part of this. This group of people almost always works together in this line of performative work. Maybe it would be a chance to step in and find my crowd... (I feel like an adolescent sometimes, looking for her group...)Just now I asked feedback for this last (amazing!) proposal and it was not uplifting... I felt surprised (had a good gut feeling about it!) and asked ""What to do about this deadline tomorrow then?""and got again a surprising 59, 4,6 > 47I stopped everything and did a scenario-check:What are the benefits of NOT going ahead with this project and simply delivering nothing tomorrow? 14, 2,3,6 > 51What are the benefits of sending what I have tomorrow? 8 unchangingI feel there is something I am avoid reading here because I so much want to go for this...! Not so much the artistic opportunity to be honest, but the human one, all these nice people to get in touch with... But the lines in 59 are very clear... move away from the group... it feels absurd, specially as I invested a week of work in all these proposals - I mean, at least to send what i got...! Then this 8... unchanging hexagrams always give me a hard time, I dont know whether to read them ""there is nothing for you to do in this situation"" (as in dont do nothing) or ""there is nothing u can do"" (as in an unavoidable energy that cant be detoured...) does anyone have a hunch on this one?is it really more beneficial to not send anything and step away from this group?(...meanwhile im getting pro in stepping away from groups I really long to belong to....!) thanks!Yoana"
480,This morning I have been studying the IChing intensely and have been blown away by how stimulating and interesting it really is but just thought I would put this one out there for further interpretation if anyone keen to confirm/deny so I maybe learn a bit more - thks!So further questioning on my connection with this difficult manWhat further contact will I have from him before he goes to Hawaii52 - self explanatory (incidentally in numerology he is Hex 52)Yep can't shift his thinking etc.What further contact will I have from him on his return from HawaiiHex 21 - Hmm...Biting through/corrective measuresSo what I found on this was - The appearance of a third party in a relationship causes a disruption that will diminish in the face of patience.Fire over Thunder - The way in which nature forces through obstacles and restores imblance of tension.so does this mean our relationship will then be 'corrected' even though the third party is still in the picure or will it be 'corrected' because she is not!thks and blessings for your help and insightMelissa x
481,"It is rather interesting, this relationship I have with Terry.  Now that I find the romantic embers have cooled, a friendship has developed between us.  It is odd, however, that during times of high stress, somehow Terry just suddenly appears in my life once again.  He has done this repeatedly over the past year.  Each time, he seems to be the voice of reason and says something that is the most logical, but also most easily overlooked answer to the problem at hand.It made me start to wonder if that is the reason he is in my life.  So, I asked Yi, ""What role does Terry play in my life?"" and got 7.3.5 > 48.  I get that he is the fixed, unchanging well with the answers that I need to hear at times when I need to organize and cannot think rationally for myself.I then decided to ask Yi about the inverse of that.  ""What role do I play in Terry's life?"" and received 4.4 > 64.  Hmm....is Yi perhaps saying that it is to help him learn from his mistakes of the past...or for him to learn about himself?"

488,"Dear friends,my brother (at this point in time I live with him and his wife in their apartment) knows a family quite well. The mother suffered from a stroke, is permanently disabled at around age 40. She has to live in a home for disabled persons some 50 km from here in Vienna where the rest of her family lives. The father has an alcohol problem.There are five brothers, age 17 to age 10.The youngest ones are twins. We had all the brothers here for a day, they are more then happy to escape from their complicated life for a while.They love to play icehockey on the computer. The twins, who are the youngest ones lose quite often.A lot of crying on their side because they feel treated badly from their older brothers. Which of course is true. And on a deeper level treated badly and unfair by life itself. Which is true as well, at least seen from the perspective of a 5th grader.I listened to one of the twins when he was crying out of impotent rage (after letting him cool down a little, sobbing in the bathroom)He lost a game...Unfair, of course.. After the fury he still cried, but this crying was coming from a deeper level.I talked very little.All of the sufferings of the youngest brother(s). The older ones are allowed to go to the cinema, to drink Coke, they are better at playing soccer, they are stronger etc. etc. You get the idea. I asked him if he (or they) see(s) a way what he/they could do to make their life better. Of course he had no idea.Me neither.I asked the Yi: ""Please give a hint to him/them  what he/they could do to make their life better.""16, 4 (Enthusiasm) to 2.°Key Questions What do you imagine?What inspires you?How can you use your enthusiasm constructively?Oracle‘Enthusiasm.Fruitful to set up feudal lords and mobilize the armies.’  The Chinese word for ‘enthusiasm’ contains an elephant – a character  that also means ‘image’. The elephant is magnificent, strong, a source  of delight – and also unpredictable and potentially dangerous.  Imagination and anticipation move us with ease; with them, we can be  motivated and inspired – or we can be carried away by the power of our  own story.  The energetic charge of enthusiasm can be used to set great things in  motion. It is good to use it to expand and enrich your experience by  extending your network of communication and support, marshalling your  resources ready for future challenges. And it is also good to use such  structures to channel the motive power of enthusiasm, and keep it from  running amok. Then its brightly coloured images can be woven securely  into the larger patterns and meanings of life.Image‘Thunder bursts forth from the earth: Enthusiasm.The ancient kings composed music to honour virtue,They celebrated and worshipped the supreme lord,Joining with their ancestors.’Sequence Enthusiasm follows from Hexagram 15, Integrity:‘One who possesses greatness and is also capable of Integrity is naturally Enthusiastic.’°Line 4‘Source of enthusiasm.Great possessions gained.Do not doubt.Partners are gathered together as a hair clasp gathers hair.’Now that sounds optimistic-but I could not tell him because it probably may sound like purest cynism his ears.What could I tell him?Ideas are more than apreciated. :bows:"
489,"Good morning,Despite what has happened over recent weeks I have not given up my quest for romance!My question - under what circumstances will I meet my new romantic partner.Hex 24.1>2So clearly I went down the wrong path with this recent relationship.So does line 1 mean once I have come back to my right path I will meet someone new or does it mean I just have to hang out with self for a while.thks and blessingsMelissa"
490,"Ok so ""should I give up"" was not the real question, but that was the thought that prompted it. The real question: How can I best cultivate a relationship with him?  32.2.4.6 > 52 Keeping still/DurationBecause we have 52 Keeping Still (no action) the response doesn't sound promising. I'm looking to see if there is reason to view this, as I have been, as a giving small doses of communication/time/energy to this over the longer haul, to obtain greater reward (ie a real relationship with him). Or, should I just forget about him in those terms? I dont know if the Yi has the answer but I'm willing to listen to whatever it may advise.So to dissect the reading:32= ""Duration is the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole."" Long continuance. /When it is said that movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous, this implies that when the moving power is spent, it will begin again.Line 2: all occasion for repentance disappearing / there is no remorse is because the line does not overstep the limits of moderation. / indicates outcome would be fine if you don't go too deep.  Keep it simple.Line 4 shows a field where there is no game. / Persistence in search is not enough. What is not sought in the right way is not found. / don't look for something in the relationship that doesn't exist. Perhaps the other in this relationship can't satisfy something that you want: know that early on, and make a decisive choice about the fact. But don't keep pursuing something that's just not there.Line 6 subject exciting himself to long continuance. There will be evil./ It's fine. It's perfect. Leave it alone. Quit fiddling with it./ Don't allow anxieties to run around in the head. / Allow yourself to settle into the relationship, don't overwork it, don't cast about for alternatives, just look for some peace within its restrictions: restlessness in the relationship will undermine it.  [L6 is about your standards and values within the relationship; look at them. Changing line 6 of 32 (only!) = hex. 50 The Cauldron, which could symbolise the relationship you want to have...]BUT we end with Hex 52, Keeping still.So does this mean not only can I not do anything to cultivate this relationship, but that I *should keep still* (ie no action)? There isn't any/much action going on as it is...Last edited: Nov 14, 2010"

Yet I agreed to meet him tomorrow so that he returns my stuff and I give him something that he requested. however I am having sdoubts, so i asked the i ching should i go. and the answer is 6 - conflict , which could not be clearer, we see things in very different way and i am having big problems with letting go and forgiving. changing lines are 3 and 5...does 5 mean state my case and explaining my views? i like 50 very much, but it is unclear what should i do to get there"
492,"There is something will take place in few days ( a health matter) and I wonder a lot if I have to share it with my nieces. More or less they know, but a couple of days, when they visited me, I felt them very confused. I know that others trying to hide them things and I know that they give them faulse informations.  Our relationship is based on mutual trust and a part of me feels not comfortable because i hide them the truth yet the other part thinKs that I'll make them worring.My wish is to share some details with them, but I don't wish that cause them unnecessary worries so I asked Yi. ""what do i need to know about my thought telling them? "". I got 43.1.6> 44. Looking at LiSe's Yi, my impression is the I can tell them , in a thoughtfull way. And 44 , perhaps is about my own anxiety. Yet, looking at other translations, seems that its not a good idea. Also the 1-6 line pattern, perhaps indicated that , a ""forget about it"" thing Wonder how you would read those lines ?Last edited: Nov 14, 2010"
493,"I have been in a (figurated) rollercoaster with someone for about a week. What started like a spiritual blow is now like the worse nightmare for me...

494,"Long time no post here, probably someone could remeber me? Ususally I am not that much of a mystery-monger, but because the topic is extremely delicate I have to be very vague. But I hope one can get the Idea nevertheless.The question is hard to understand without revealing anything, so I try to be as vague as possible and as specific as necessary.So here it goes:I have been the witness of a severe crime, done to a person which I do not know personally. Let's say, I have a physical proof of that crime. The victim cannot speak for himself out of various reasons, mostly psychological ones.I am reasoning now if it would be sensible and the ""right thing to do"" to report that crime. If it sounds illogical why I even have to reason about reporting or not, there are extremely good reasons for both possible ways: To report or not.So I asked three questions:What should be my general approach to that case:34 second and fourth line changing to 36It truly is a ""Darkening of the Light"", that is perfectly true. The case in question is really sad. I should not use to much of ""power"" in trying to bring light into this case, but I should try to stay centered (2nd) and can trust that the case could be solved (the fence breaks open, regrets dissappear). This is an outline of what I have got from the first reading.Plesase describe the Dao wich will be generated by reporting it to law enforcement? 7, The ArmyIt woud need ""a strong man"" to cope with the task at hand.LiSe wrote about The Army: "". Have         the guts to act worthy of yourself. Then         you can defend your territory and make a place where you and your people         are safe, happy and prospering.""So I take that something close to an encouragment, if I am the ""great Man"" I  would be capable to cope with the problems.Reporting should be the last resource, (Wilhelm) on the other hand.Plesase describe the Dao wich will be generated by not reporting it to law enforcement? 23 unchanging...Certainly not a good one.I got a little bit more from that answers than I can write here about.May I ask what your take on it would be?Namaste,SoshinP.S.: I am probbly entangled too much on the emotional leve because of the severity of the crime, by my sympathy and my pity for the victim.Last edited: Jul 17, 2008"
495,"My grandfather was quite a wealthy man, and on his death a number of years ago I learnt that my father's share of his estate (as he is also deceased) will pass to myself and my brother and sister. The estate itself would not be divided until the death of my grandmother. Unfortunately, she passed away about four months ago. My father was the youngest of three boys, and I have found the two older sons (my uncles) extraordinarily difficult to deal with about it. They give out no information, even when asked, although I have a perfectly good right to know.  When I asked the estate solicitor for information about what was the estate (as I knew nothing except that there was an inheritance) after grandad died I got an angry responce from the eldest uncle, and he told everyone  I was ""desperate"" for money etc.A close aunt from that side has confided that she fears there is some underhanded business going on from them, and she is worried that I and my brother and sister will see nothing from the estate. I asked the I ching. ""What would be the best way to approach the issue of the Will?""20: 5 - 23I see this as a clear indication I need to get involved directly, and closely. (Not an easy matter!). The spliting apart (normally a hexigram I see as a danger warning) in this instance could be fortunate. I also asked "" What is the current situation regarding my grandfather's will?""And a very similar responce.20: 1,2,5,6 - 19So that is very clear! But how? Do I need a solicitor to push for my interests?I have two options for solicitors, my mother's (I ching said 56:1,3,4,6 - 24)or one which I have used in the past and have benefited from his help (56: 3,5,6 - 45)ARGH!"

497,"I asked Yi what lesson do I need to learn from my recent unsuccessful relationship with someone who moved away?  In reply, I got 38.1.4.6>7   Being new and wishing to learn here is my interpretation:  38.1 Don't chase after anyone but learn to accept that those who belong with us will come back and those who don't will leave.38.4 Not sure what the lesson in this line - it rather describes me meeting the person in question - I live in a city where I have hard time connecting and meeting new people (hence isolated) and he was someone I felt connected and shared a lot in common with so for the brief time I didn't feel so isolated (perhaps the lesson here is to reassure me that there was no mistake in dating this person? not quite sure).38.6 Perhpas this line advises me not to be so critical of my ex who left and not to view him as ""a pig covered with dirt"".  The line also talks about the union but I don't want to put any hopes on that.   I also asked ""what is the meaning of X coming into my life and than leaving?"" and got 54 (unchanging).   Is it saying that certain things are just out of our control?  Anyway, I was hoping to get some feedback and comments from more experienced IChing users to make sure I keep on learning.   Thank you guys in advance!"
498,"I have been trying to follow the 11 advice, peace, withdrawl etc regarding the man who I'm interested in. I went to the symphony with friends a week ago tomorrow. I haven't heard from the man in question in 2 weeks though now he is back in town. I thought to email him and say I'm sorry he missed it, bc it was fabulous, a group of 8 of us went, thanks for the recommendation otherwise I would not have gone/am taking off soon/hope to see you afterwards. But my initial plan was not to contact him at all until December, after I'm back from my research trip. I asked the Yi which plan is best.1) What if I email him before I go? 7.4>40. I read that line 4 means retreat. Therefore despite the fact it says no misfortune, that suggests it is a bad idea.2) What if I don't contact him before I leave? 42.5>27 The Yi seems to like that idea. line 5: higher powers saying ""good job"" what's inside you is what counts. Ok then:3) What if I contact him after I return? (is this too a bad idea?) 7.6 > 4 folly.What confuses me here is the changing line. I understand the Yi doesnt want me to keep asking. But line 6 -- i can't seem to see how that fits here.  I read on other threads about this line that, ""this isn't a hexagram about fighting. It's about how to survive. The image tells us that the superior man increases his masses not by outwitting an enemy, but by his generosity toward the people."" That implies generosity (contact) would be good in this case.   ""Small men should not be employed: they are sure to throw the states into confusion. The war has ended successflly, victory is won."" But who are the small men? What does that mean? It implies I'd ask someone else to communicate for me, which isnt my plan... Is there anything here I am missing?Last edited: Nov 13, 2010"
499,"Hi,I have a couple of blogs (message me if you'd like the addresses!) One is of my writing (and quite revealing...) the other is of my interests - quotes I like, music, photos etc.As I said, they're quite revealing and I'm worried I may be alienating people, perhaps who don't understand me, or misunderstand me, take them to literally etc etc.I asked the I ching:Am I alienating people with my blogs (people I already know that is) or must I be true to myself and brave?18.3, 4 > 64 Hilary:You want to deal with corruption and move on, setting life on a firmer footing... this can easily tip over into being pushy and anxious and going too far. So there is small regret – perhaps you could have managed this better, or more calmly – but no great mistake. Your basic desire to understand and move forward is not wrong at all.- This line is OK and how I feel. It's a project for me at the mo - going through old notebooks and putting ideas and feelings out there, in a way so I can start afresh once I'm done. Write more positively and hopefully stories, not so introspective.But....Line 4: 'The situation is fundamentally corrupt. Only a thoroughgoing reform of the whole structure will create a healthy environment for future growth.However, you’re reluctant to take on responsibility for such a decisive change. You don’t want to see how rotten things have become; you find you can tolerate the situation, and live in the expectation – or just the hope – that it will all sort itself out somehow.But in fact the real situation is not sustainable, and if you go on this will become painfully apparent.64 > Chaos...I do kind of feel like I'd like to leave them as they are, because I'm expressing myself, but I don't want to be causing further corruption... Perhaps if you're interested and would like to check them out maybe you could give your opinion as to whether I need to rein them in a bit? I am also, in a way, trying to get the attention of someone I feel would understand it all, the same person I'm now estranged from, which may be dodgy Perhaps the reading is saying that this is an on-going journey, not yet completed and the negativity is part of the journey? A lot of my posts on my writing blog are about depression, and the pain of rejection/unrequited love etc. They reflect past states that I don't feel now, or at least no where near as strongly, because I feel happy at the mo, OK with myself for perhaps the first time in my life, and I think writing has played a big part in that.

500,"Good morning,Further to my previous post http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=11528,we have had no contact since and it has made me realise just how disrespectful I allowed him to treat me. Friends just don't treat each other like he has treated me, however I have asked what can I expect from him twds me over the weekendHex 38.1.2>35Opposing’ describes irreducible differences – desires, motivations and especially ways of seeing that diverge from one another. ‘Opposing’ people see differently even when they’re looking at the same scene; they are utterly strange to each other, as if they came from different planets. This statement says it all and at the moment I keep thinking he is going to ring me and yell at me again and even though I understand it is his own stuff I realise that I don't deserve to be treated like that. Of course I don't have to pick up the phone but previous to this I certainly didn't expect him to be yelling at me.So back to the question - regrets vanish, see hateful people, don't chase things will return and line 2meeting a master - not a mistakethku for your insight I am feeling a bit vunerable at presentMelissa x"

503,"51.2 > 54 then 50.4 > 18 (1st post. Empath w/intuition Rewn impending mortality)Hello all, and thank you for reading....I have been observing this forum for a little under two years.  I utilize I Ching quite often, but would not consider myself anywhere near an expert at all.  It seems to be the most effective/accurate form of divining for me.Please forgive the length of this post, as it is gives both background as well as asks questions of you.  I reveal a great deal of background and personal information below, as I have quite literally asked the I Ching if my intuition with regard to my own mortality is correct.If you want to skip all the background information, I've formatted this post so all you have to do is scroll down to the large print, bold, italicized and underlined portion of this post entitled:""The Nitty Gritty"". The questions I posed are also in bold and italics, and the hexagrams I received are italicized for your convenience.I am truly grateful for your input.  I realize it is a dangerous question to ask, however, it is not a question to which I do not want to know the answer.I also know that I am not the only one that has had knowledge (or at least feels they do) with regard to their own time frame on this plane.A little background on me: I am an empath with a number of issues/gifts only recently re-discovered and acknowledged.  As a youth,  I predicted the death of a close relative, and took the blame after having prevented his departure from our location by repeatedly exclaiming: ""You can't leave, you're going to die!!"" (The location also happened to be my birthday party).  Well, he was killed in a car accident anyway, and as a nine year old, my mind immediately rationalized that had I not prevented his departure, he would not have passed.  This was not the first predictive and/or empathic incident of my youth, but after this occasion, I deteriorated rapidly, and literally stopped eating. I had no interest in surviving.  I was very angry at my gifts and rejected them quite adamantly.   I wanted to die and did not get well or begin to eat or live again until I had fully suppressed them.  Well, as best I could for a 9 year old.  I still sometimes knew what song would come on the radio, who was calling before the phone rang, successfully chose 4 numbers in the lottery for my mother on one occasion, absorbed the sicknesses of others - so I could never get massages, knew when people passed on, and other various and intermittent things I chose to not give credibility to nor could control, and desperately did not want to have the ability to do.I have only come to terms with and accepted these gifts again in the past year or so,  after an NDE in August 2008  caused them to re-emerge and quite literally go ape#$@&.    I was scaring people - and scaring myself.  I thought I was going mad - and people were perceiving me as a lunatic.  I can't tell you how many times I heard the question: ""How did you know that? Are you: (following me, tapping my phone, reading my mind)?""  I was dreaming things as they were happening, frying electronics, and causing myself and others all kinds of distress.  I began engaging in studies and numerous validation exercises with people where and when they are open to it, but otherwise utilizing other mechanisms - such as email (for purposes of time/date stamp) when such personal validation methods are not available - and sometimes even when they are.  I am only recently learning to trust my instincts, and achieving any kind of balance.  (The past six months or so)Regarding others, I trust myself 100%.  I am completely confident in my instincts with others, and I know when I'm ""off"".   With regard to myself, however, I almost always second guess myself, and assert (subconsciously or not - I am uncertain) life experiences, fears and wishes that cloud my certainty, and I do not have the same level of accuracy concerning my own affairs.  I have a cloudy prism where I am concerned.I rarely remember my dreams.  When I do, it is only because they are of great significance. Last night, my maternal great grandmother, who passed in 1979, was in my dreams.  I have been smelling/tasting her presence for about a month.  I have expressed to at least two friends, familiar with my 'quirks' and who have witnessed events and accuracy pertaining to them, that I feel I will not be 'around' much longer.  I do not feel panic nor despair over this. I am also a cancer (thyroid) survivor and was informed late last year of a mild recurrence, but have not yet sought treatment, as it is supposed to be slow moving and highly treatable.  My instincts tell me that this is not the issue directly, but there may be a correlation (such as a secondary cancer due to methods of treatment sought with the primary occurrence - such as radioactive iodine ingested).  I have, to date, experienced an astounding accuracy to date with identifying medical issues in others.  It is also my understanding that empaths, when absorbing the ills of others, can/do take on and magnify them internally - resulting in their own physical degradation.  I am still learning about all of this.I throw I Ching electronically, as I feel it is most accurate.  I have been informed that pyro/elektro kinetics are among my issues and have quite literally fried a number of electronics since my NDE in August 2008.  (6 phones, 3 laptops).  I sincerely hope that this does not sound completely crazy to you all, and plead with those to whom this does sound crazy or those who do not believe in such things to please move on from this post, as I am looking for non-judgmental input/advice and wish only to attract the energy and input of those who wish no harm and harbor no ill will or negative intent toward me. Thank you.The Nitty Gritty:I have become increasingly more aware of my mortality, sensing that time is an issue for me.  I asked the question:  ""Is my intuition correct with regard to how much time I have?"" (42 is a number that simply will not leave my mind - however I threw what you see below)I received 51.2 > 54.  Of course this confused me.  I am 39 and not married, so I wondered, perhaps I was too vague in my question.  I also wondered if perhaps I had asserted a subconscious concern as have been a bit sad about being unmarried/unpartnered recently, and asked a question for clarity.  ""Is the previous answer regarding Marriage or Death?""I received 50.4 > 18.I have learned over the past year or so to both strongly trust my instincts.  But again, have very little confidence or accuracy when they directly concern myself as of yet.I also know that life experiences as well as subconscious intent, thought and fears can play a role in answers received as well as both the accuracy and interpretation of any reading.  Finally, I realize that one may be told important things, receive important information in readings - and not necessarily be given a direct answer to one's question in a reading, but rather be given a message that one needs to get.  I am uncertain if that is the case here, and whether I've received a message that I need to hear that pertains to another important issue in my life or a direct answer to the question I have asked. That said, I don't want to give my own interpretation because I don't want to assert any influence here.I know I can be a very stubborn woman, and I can sometimes miss the forest through the trees.  I have other serious situations in my life, that the I ching may be speaking to - so I realize that I must take that under consideration.  Thus I am seeking the input of others here.I often see posts with very little information included, and see many of you struggle to interpret how the hexagram could apply, or what the IChing could be speaking to.  I am usually a frightfully private person, but I feel that I need to be garnering something very important - if not urgent - from today's inquiry, so I will not be so coy.  Other important issues in my life:I have a 15 year old son who is Asperger's and entered the Juvenile System while I was in the middle of trying to get him diagnosed.  It's a travesty that he is in the system, I have obtained counsel, and we are in process of filing suit on a number of grounds - among them his having been beaten in their care.  He is in the foster system at the moment, and there are some awful people involved in his life right now, so he is not currently in my custody.  The persons involved in his life have more or less alienated him from me, do not facilitate or encourage his relationship with me, and due to his Asperger's I'm generally the last thought on his mind.  I have to work very hard to maintain a relationship with him, as communication is absolutely never instigated by him.  One issue with Asperger's is the proper reciprocation of emotions, and he does not feel a connection to me as most people feel maternal connections.   I understand this, and while it hurts sometimes, I put forth the effort despite the obstacles in place.I recently moved to a neighboring state to pursue medical treatment, but have not started yet, as I still have legal issues I am dealing with regarding my son - including the fact that the parties involved illegally severed portions my parental rights.   I am in process of regaining them, it is one of the things I am addressing with counsel.Simultaneously, there are also legal matters that have fallen into place in which I now have the opportunity to collect on a significant Judgment against someone that I obtained over 3 years ago as personal representative (PR) concerning my Mother's estate - which was the only significant amount of money that could have gone to any heirs.  (Myself and my brother)  Other than this judgment, there was nothing.   Once obtained, I will receive a salary for my role as PR, and the remainder will be divided between my brother and myself.  Instinctively (or so I believe), I have begun discussing my wishes concerning how my son is to utilize these funds, which will be placed in trust once collected, once I am gone.I also am a graduate student - training in the legal profession, but have taken a leave of absence from my studies to address health issues.  Initially, it was because the NDE incident kicked my gifts into ""high gear"", and I was unable to function properly in my studies.  Subsequently, I extended the leave of absence because I was informed of the recurrence of the thyroid cancer.Also (perhaps?) of note:  There is one man that I am interested in, and he has garnered a great deal of my emotional/psychic attention.  We dated briefly last Sept - Oct, but his career halted it.  We are still great friends.  I have virtually no desire to date others, and have not given myself to anyone - in any sense of the word - since I met him.  This is unusual for me.  He is an unusual man, and may or may not also be Asperger's - like my son.  He recently revealed to me that a diagnosis was entertained as a youth for him, but it was never pursued with vigor.  To me, it (Aperger's) fits as he is unable to achieve balance (career/relationship) as many people can - at least not at the moment.   (He and my son get along incredibly well and remind me of one another.)  He's either ""all in"" with a career or a relationship - but not both.Many people, it seems, are jumping on the ""labels don't mean anything"" (or are used as an excuse) bandwagon - but I, for one, find them useful if for no other reason, than to explain certain characteristics in people, garner acceptance for them, and assist in dissipating resentment for things people have no control over.I have revealed a great deal of personal information because I hope that it will  assist in the accuracy of interpreting these hexagrams, as I strongly feel that I need to hear the message in these hexagrams - whatever it is intended to be - loud and clear.  Once again, I thank you for reading and considering this lengthy post, and wish to stress that I am neither panicked nor in despair with regard to this.   I only wish to garner the insight of those more experienced and objective with regard to interpreting these hexagrams, what message it appears I should be taking away from today's reading and how they apply to my situation(s).  Thank you so very much and I appreciate your time and input.  :bows:Alliekat."
504,"Hi all! I'm new to this new forum and so excited to learn from all you experienced i-chingers!Anyway, I decided a good way to study the i-ching would be to weekly throw a hexagram and then read it every night trying to understand it in a new way.  I rarely now ask specific questions; I find the Sage usually knows the answer to my question I didn't even know I had. So I rec'vd 24, Fu/Return, which seemed very applicable to my own life due to a very traumatic spring/summer seeming to calm down. I rc'vd changing lines 4 and 6, which created Hex 21, Biting Through.The two changing lines really threw me off until I started thinking about my dad, and thought how perfectly it fit his life.As for Biting Thru, I have a hard time understanding why that Hex would throw light apon 24. 24 seems to be about still conserving energy, while 21 is about taking action against an obstacle in a sort of legal way. huh?Any thoughts? Again so happy to meet all of you!Karin from Whidbey Island, WA, USA"
505,"Hi all,Was asking about a certain plan in regards to a project and I recieved 64-->12. Already have an idea its going be a tough case, however it seems positive & I'm going change alot from it internally. Q: What would the effect be of using x plan for the project. Would like any interpretations of 64-->12Thanks."
506,"For some reason or another, when I ask yi about my career, I receive responses that appear to be about relationships and conflicts.Elias pointed this out to me in a career thread and since then, I have noticed this as an ongoing pattern in my readings.Well, I am contemplating finishing my Bachelors degree and possibly majoring in Marketing. Since I want to work in real estate, i think this could be advantageous to my career.I asked: ""What benefit could getting a degree in Marketing have on my career?""the response was 38.6>54Okay, so, reading the Willhelm translation of the line it basically describes a situation where there is a misunderstanding between two people, and one of the people cannot see past their anger/fear/suspicion of the other person and is prepared to fight them.Nine at the top means:Isolated through opposition,One sees one's companion as a pig coveredwith dirt, as a wagon full of devils.First one draws a bow against him,then one lays the bow aside.He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is brought about not by outer circumstances but by inner conditions. A man misjudges his best friends, taking them to be as unclean as a dirty pig in and as dangerous as a wagon full of devils. He adopts an attitude of defense. But in the end, realizing his mistake, he lays aside the bow, perceiving that the other is approaching with the best intentions for the purpose of close union. Thus the tension is relieved. The union resolves the tension, just as falling rain relieves the sultriness preceding a thunderstorm. All goes well, for just when opposition reaches its climax it changes over to its antithesis.I am shaking my head at this because for the past few weeks, i have been fighting with this friend of mine (various threads on this site about that situation) and we recently had a HUGE blow out about a pesky girl (one of several) who caused problems. Things are a little weird still but we are now at a peaceful place...again.I asked about the current status of that relationship and got 15.2>46 which seems to reflect the situation perfectly. Then I asked: what would happen between us and got 61.2.3>37 which.....ugh, that third line....bothers me but does describe the emotional turmoil behind this erm, union.Then I asked what kind of love he has for me and got 2.1.2.3>11 and that is a nice pleasant enough take on things. Not too passionate not too ambivalent, just easy going and affectionate.So, I really cannot see how or why the oracle would repeatedly give me responses that show tumultuous relationships for career readings.Back to my original question.....I can sort of see how this reading would apply to my question....employers may not think I am a suitable candidate as it stands right now due to my rather dismal resume...yet with a degree, perhaps this would change their views of me as an employee?I am just wondering why this keeps happening with career readings.....why does it seem as if my relationship issues are coming out in the readings? I really do not consider the situation with my friend to be more important that my career and education....maybe to yi, they are both somehow interwoven?Fascinating to me.Maybe I am reading the answers incorrectly or is yi giving me an all around answer that covers a lot of ground? I have noticed that consulting yi is a lot like talking to a friend in that, if I ask a question or seek input on something, it will respond with a very direct answer...however, sometimes it will say something like, ""yes..interesting though that topic may be, did you know that...?"" and change the subject entirely.Anyway, i am rambling. Sorry for the long post...I am just a bit perplexed and wondering why this is happening.Namaste and thank you in advance for any and all input. I do appreciate the feedback.:bows:Last edited: Nov 10, 2010"
507,"…or ‘Where did Hilary go?’ Well… I sit myself down in front of a task and my brain goes on strike. It’s got quite radical about it: ‘Sit and stare at the screen all you like,’ it says, ‘but if you think anything useful is getting done here, you’ve got another think coming. Or you would have, if I weren’t on strike. See – nothing happening, is there?’ And there isn’t. It’s not as if there were a shortage of things to get done, either – but somewhere between my ears, the hamster has got off the emailreadingemailsitemaintenanceemailemailforumemailblogemailtranscriptsproductsemailwebsitesemailemailemail wheel, curled up and fallen asleep. I’m enjoying doing readings, and meeting deadlines by the skin of my teeth, but all the other things have been falling by the wayside. Hm. I rather hoped this might be a cue that I should have a holiday, but of course it might just be a cue to give myself a good kick. Well, I’d find out if I asked Yi and it gave me hexagram 7, wouldn’t I? So I asked Yi: ‘How to respond to this aversion to work?’ And Yi responded with hexagram 7 (heh…) changing at lines 4 and 6 to 64. So there is an army, yes, but it’s not yet across – and specifically, it’s camping on the left, no mistake. That’s a literal translation of what Wilhelm simply has as ‘retreat’, and Brad calls a ‘fallback encampment’. Exactly. So… despite the very amusing experience of getting hexagram 7, this is not time to try to kick myself into action. It’s OK not to fight this. I can relax from the campaign for a bit… and of course this line points, beautifully, towards 40, Release. Another meaning of this line would be to stay in a defensible, supply-able position, not to overextend the army. (One of those intriguing notes in Lynn’s book connects this with the ideal position according to the Art of War.)  Hence not, for instance, to commit myself to things I can’t carry through. This makes me feel better about not squeezing in a Yijing Class this year. The other line in my reading is a bit more of a challenge: ‘The great leader has a mandateTo found a state and receive the households.Don’t use small people.’ Gulp? Clearly the sleeping-hamster-scenario doesn’t mean it’s time to wind the business down and become a librarian or something. It seems to be about expansion, community, and creating something self-sustaining. The small people are raising an inner ruckus, and the connection between this line and Hexagram 4 – aka Being Clueless – has never been so apparent…"
508,"Fell in love in my 20's, he was married.  Years later we reconnected, he showed all of his heart, we made plans to be together & before that could happen, his wife had a serious illness.  I ended it since there was no resolution, nothing to be done. She died 10 years ago, I found this information last week, wrote him a letter and we spoke just last night.He has remarried, but still admits I was the love of his life, and he was mine. He still wants to keep in touch (phone) even though I said I couldn't see him, that would be playing with fire. He knows that I have no plans to marry again or really have any relationship.  Not interested in general, not just because of my feelings for him. The only one I would choose to be with is him, but as they say timing is everything, and that was never our strong point.I asked ""what does the universe say"" to this news and got 41.6.  Yes, it is/has diminished? Because we were out of touch so long?Then I asked what the lesson was, how could I regard our current situation now, and got 2, no changing lines.

Its most important quality is its vulnerability, changeability. Give it a solid base, but upon that, make it alive, delicate, new every day.""the resulting hex 6, perhaps referring to the ongoing dialogue with myself in the course of releasing myself from this habit? a continual negotiation?  is it saying that i need to make the decision firm within myself, aware of the dangers of continuing, but be flexible within my approach?insights much appreciated ..."
512,"I asked the i ching if all those secret lodges mentioned in the conspiracy thoeries (you know, those who control the world from behind the scanes) really exist or these are all unbased rumors?Wierd question, i know, but as an occultist, these things interest me.He gave me:     47.   K'un / Oppression (Exhaustion)     ---- ----     ----------        above    Tui    The Joyous, Lake     ----------     ---- ----     ----------        below    K'an   The Abysmal, Water     ---- ----     The Judgement          Oppression. Success. Perseverance.          The great man brings about good fortune.          No blame.          When one has something to say,          It is not believed.     The Image          There is no water in the lake:          The image of Exhaustion.          Thus the superior man stakes his life          On following his will.     The Lines     Six in the third place means:          A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,          And leans on thorns and thistles.          He enters his house and does not see his wife.          Misfortune.     Nine in the fourth place means:          He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.          Humiliation, but the end is reached.     48.   Ching / The Well     ---- ----     ----------        above    K'an   The Abysmal, Water     ---- ----     ----------     ----------        below    Sun    The Gentle, Wind     ---- ----     The Judgement          The Well. The town may be changed,          But the well cannot be changed.          It neither decreases nor increases.          They come and go and draw from the well.          If one gets down almost to the water          And the rope does not go all the way,          Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.     The Image          Water over wood: the image of the Well.          Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,          And exhorts them to help one another.I am pretty convinced this means ""no!"" but is it just a no. Or is it ""no, it is not relevant to you"" type of no?"
513,"Hello everyone, am glad to have found such a great resource in this site.  Thank you to Hilary for helping me get started with the I Ching.  The downloads and beginners' guide have been great.I began my day with a question about a project at work and received a straightforward answer not to proceed.  Next I asked about tying up loose ends at work instead, and received a remarkable response.  All six lines are changing; the result was 64/Before Completion moving to 63/After Completion.  While this makes absolutely perfect sense, I'm a bit confused as to the significance of six changing lines.  Reading them 1-6 gives conflicting information.  Is it correct to interpret line 1 as current, and gradually moving toward line 6?I'm excited about proceeding with the I Ching, and thank you to everyone here!"
514,"What if I REQUEST full time remote work? (it is doubtful they are OK with this or would offer it on their own)    23.6>2Line 6: On the topmost branches, the unattainable fruit grows and ripens but is not plucked. At the right time it will fall and plant a seed to grow anew. The Superior Man once more has influence. He is surrounded by those who respect him as if he rode in a carriage. But the inferior man, by their own actions, have brought destruction upon themselves. line 6: Here the splitting apart reaches its end. When misfortune has spent itself, better times return. The seed of the good remains, and it is just when the fruit falls to the ground that good sprouts anew from its seed. The superior man again attains influence and effectiveness. He is supported by public opinion as if in a carriage. But the inferior man’s wickedness is visited upon himself, is house is split apart. A law of nature is at work here. Evil is not destructive to the good alone but inevitably destroys itself as well. For evil, which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to exist on its own strength alone. The inferior man himself fares best when held under control by a superior man.Am I small or superior? According to them?What if I suggest 2 days per week in office (and that agreed upon in writing)?58.4.5>19line4: shows its subject deliberating about what to seek his pleasure in, and not at rest. He borders on what would be injurious, but there will be cause for joy.L4: The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and allows the customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is no harm in this; she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly, finds the husband intended for her.L5: The sovereign I is T’ang the Completer. This ruler decreed that the imperial princesses should be subordinated to their husbands in the same manner as other women (cf. hexagram 11, six in the fifth place). The emperor does not wait for a suitor to woo his daughter but gives her in marriage when he sees fit. Therefore it is in accord with custom for the girl’s family to take the initiative here.We see here a girl of aristocratic birth who marries a man of modest circumstances and understands how to adapt herself with grace to the new situation. She is free of all vanity of outer adornment, and forgetting her rank in her marriage, takes a place below that of her husband, just as the moon, before it is quite full, does not directly face the sun.line5: shows its subject trusting in one who would injure him. The situation is perilous.What if I admit/speak aloud that salary is less important than freedom and flex hours?18.3>4line 3: shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his father. There may be some small occasion for repentance, but there will not be any great error.I am just scared about what I can say and not say, bc they can turn away and not offer me the job. The recruiter is to phone tomorrow morning again. iwasn't expecting his call today bc last I heard, they would do a 2-3 month trial period as a contracter. But he called asking me what i wanted in terms of salary and responsibilities and hours... and they dont have remote workers, but bc of m yother duties (my two books being published, teaching, and the travels related to book projects) i need the flexibility of remote work and doubt they're really keen on that.I wanted to know what to say and what NOT to say for tomorrow's call...And I suppose the real question: What if I tell them I do not want to/do well in being in the office at all?56.2.3 > 64L2: shows the stranger, occupying his lodging-house, carrying with him his means of livelihood, and provided with good and trusty servants.L3: shows the stranger, burning his lodging-house, and having lost his servants. However firm and correct he try to be, he will be in peril.64 ""There will be no advantage in any way.""I am guessing that here, Honesty is Not the Best Policy.I welcome any input in terms of these questions.Last edited: Nov 2, 2010"
515,"I recently met a man that totally swept me off my feet.  After years of having difficult relationships and fearing commitment, I finally feel like there is very much potential in this one.  I asked the I-ching about what the future holds for a relationship with this man.  Granted, I've only had one date with him, but I can't shake this feeling that he is the one I've been searching for all my life.I drew Hexagram 55 unchanging.  I'm having a hard time interpreting this, as it seems positive at first, but there's an underlying sense of doom that scares me.  He told me he did want to see me again, just to give a little more background info...Can anyone help give me a reading on this one?"

517,I'm new to IChing and hope someone can help me traslate what I got.My question: should I continue keeping in touch with my ex boyfriend.I got 32 no changing lines.Summay of my storyI dated him about 7 years back and never seen each other again.  Now we both have our own families.  He emailed me and started talking to me again (we now live half world apart).So I don't really know what I'm doing right now.  I enjoy keeping in touch with him but I also know that the chance of us getting back together is next to nothing.  So I asked iching if I should continue keeping in touch with him.  The first time I got 15 no changing line.  And now I got 32 no changing lines.  So it means I should continue keeping in touch with him and then?  What would happen?  Or maybe there no answer for the future yet?Thanks!
518,"Hi all! I graduated last october. Till date, I am finding difficult securing a job. I am getting very restless with all the waiting and job applications.

519,"Hello.So, I'm in my first year of college and I can't work out what I'm doing here, and I've been agonising over dropping out. I wanted to see what I Ching thought, so I consulted with the question, ""Should I drop out?"" and got 32.4 -> 46. I interepreted that as a ""yes"" - there's ""no game in the field"" here, and I should rise beyond it. As I understand it there's meant to be something 'noble' or rewarding about ""Persevering"", but that seems at odds with it changing on line 4 (and Hilary's notes suggested so).Since I'm struggling with my work in the here and now due to illness, and dropping out is a long-term thing, anyway, I asked, ""How should I approach this work crisis?"" and received exactly the same answer. ""Cheeky!"" I thought. I interepreted that as a ""Don't bother, it's fruitless.""Am I looking at this from totally the wrong angle? Is there a less, well, extreme way to interpret this?Incidentally, I also asked about a relationship I want - there's someone here I'm infatuated with - and received 44.1.2.3 -> 25. In light of the next two answers, I'm tempted to take that to mean, ""Don't get too serious about it."" Is it a warning that he's something that could keep me here, if it worked out between us, and here is not where I ought to be?Thanks and best wishes,Alex."
520,"Hi everyone,Maybe because it's halloween soon, I've been looking into wiccan spells. Partly for fun and partly, well, you never know...I did one once when I was about 13. I was being bullied at my school bus-stop, and one day it climaxed - was at its worst - when the head bully brought props along too to taunt me (it was about my appearance and he brought a plastic fish from his dad's market stall) Aaaanyway, I did a spell to stop his bullying - to leave me alone. And the next morning when I went down to the bus-stop, as I came into view the taunts didn't start as they usually did! And I felt confident that they wouldn't. Sort of felt invisible. The spell had worked - he/they left me alone! And though I got the occassional name-calling, it was never as bad as it had been, again. Maybe they themselves had felt guilty for going to that extreme, or maybe I did invoke the power of the universe. Who knows.I performed a simple one yesterday, and this eve, to 'bring a lost love back' (but (disclaimer) only if there's a spark still left in their heart. Bringing people together who aren't meant to be only ends in pain etc which is what it warns on the website. Also of course I could be wishing for something that isn't right for me anyway.  and that would be damaging. I've seen enough of what incompatibility can do.)Anyway, if anything it's good to do as a symbolic gesture. I've been feeling very strongly about this recently, well for a couple of years now and it's more intense at certain times than others. Maybe I should be doing a spell to take away my obsession with this person... It hurts.I asked the I ching to comment on the spell I'd just performed and received 20.1,5>2720.1 is about looking at something childishly. Could the yi be saying thinking spells will bring this person to me is silly? Or that I'm approaching the wicca as an amateur? (and maybe with more scepticism than I had as a teenager thus not wholeheartedly?)20.5> About self-examination...27> Seeking nourishment...I can't put this answer together to decide what Yi is saying about my spell?Any ideas would be most appreciated. :bows: "
521,"I recently realized I am angry a lot, that I carry it inside me almost all the time, and I dont know why.  I went to Yi for insight and asked why am I angry so much, whati is the source?  I received 23.2.  As a direct answer to my question I can see it, at least in part.  I feel out of control of many aspects of my life.  I also sometimes feel like my life has been highjacked.  I am unemployed, and despite having applied for over 80 jobs just for one county (Im a certified teacher, but have even been applying for clerical and educational asst positions,with no response), I have not even had an interview.  You would think I would have all kinds of free time, but my family seems to have the attitude that because Im unemployed I have nothing to do so they can obligate me to all kinds of things without even asking, though of course even when they do I feel guilty if I say no.  I have hopes and dreams of my own, working on writing a book, but they dont support any of it.  Actually they take offense at most of it, or they just tell me that people have been trying to do this for thousands of years and failed, so why should I think I can do something they couldnt.  Anyway, Im trying to figure out if there is also advice here, and if so, what is it?  Is it saying I should back off with them, just hide everything that would be confrontational, or is it saying just the oppisite, that I need to stop hiding, be more outspoken?  Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."
522,"I am very surprised about a development between me and a man half my age and from a completely different culture.It seems that he would like to be my lover, I like him a lot he is kind, helpful and interesting.

I would really appreciate the companionship and the possible adventure.I wonder if it is only my fear of rejection that is holding me backany thoughts and contributions gratefully received"
523,"Or maybe he just wants to be friends?  Maybe he doesn't know what he wants.I was dumped by a boyfriend of 4 and a half years.  I was devastated, but I did my best to get over him.  One and a half years later, I am so much stronger. A few days ago, my ex contacted me to let me know he was going to be headed my direction, and would I like to get my things back that I had left at his house?  We arranged to meet after I got off work the next day.  I asked ""what should I expect for tomorrow?""  42.6  For me, it meant that I had gone through a lot of pain and suffering to get to where I am today, and line 6 was a warning to keep my own heart steady, to not fall to pieces at seeing him again. The first thing he said was ""I'm sorry the way things turned out"", but I immediately changed the subject.  He was friendly, hinted around that he had broken up with his new girlfriend, made some ""remember when we...""  comments, and he ended up driving the stuff directly to my house just to be nice.  I suggested we also fix the cell phone account today (we have to go into Verizon together), and he said we should do it the next time he's in town.  And also we should take my dog to play with his sister's dogs.  I handled myself superbly through the visit, and didn't seem too eager.  My heart is tough now!  But I don't want it to get broken again.  I asked ""how should I interpret B's behavior?""  and got 16, unchanging.Last edited: Nov 6, 2010"

527,"Hello, Been undergoing a period of separation in a relationship and recently got some ambiguous communication from the other person which made me wonder where the relationship is at present--on hold, opening up, diminishing or something else even. I consulted the Yi to see what best steps are to move ahead..Status of our rel. in general now?53.5<52The line indicates misunderstandings keeping things sterile, but which eventually work themselves out.LiSe says: ""What is part of your being or your aims will always reveal itself, and it will have more effect if it realizes itself day by day than by pouring out everything at one go.""What sort of rel can X and I make now?13.4<37Since 13 is about fellowship, I'm reading this as saying focus on being harmonious friends who see things from the same viewpoint. Drop any fighting attitudes or viewpoints and come together in ways that we can come together. And for Hx 37: ""A noble one’s words have substance and her actions are consistent"" will help.And from the forum: ""...an issue about trust and selfishness, but all is not lost; if you are pleasant to one another, that's a step in the right direction.Persevere using gentle powers of persuasion and be sincere in all that you say, truth will win in the end.""So I got from these that all is not lost and the next step is to stop fighting and create more of a peaceful and safe environment to further nourish the relationship. Any other ideas/thoughts/experiences with these lines? Would love to hear other points of view here.Thank you, LR:bows:Last edited: Sep 1, 2010"
528,"hello there I'm new to this blog and to the i ching generallyI've only recently started studying itWHat I just asked is ""what am I for these people?"" and I got 52.2.5>57Now these people are a theatre group I'd like to work with. I've been following their work for two years now, and sometimes I have the idea they like me sometimes they seem to think I'm someone to avoid.any help?thank you!!"
529,"Hello everyone,I have been reading this forum for a couple of months in a desire to gain more insight into I-ching and I find it very helpful.   I always get the ""aha"" moment by reading others' responses, but now I feel that I need to actually ask for help with a reading.  This reading is surprisingly negative, and that's why I feel that it would be beneficial to really consider my actions with a good friend of mine.  We have been friends for a few years, and were much closer in the past that we are now.  I read about all her endeavors online as she is very active with an organization that she founded.  Bottom line is, I feel I can't be fully honest with her, and that has created a rift in our friendship.  But she has made it a point through the years to support my endeavors, and I have in turn supported hers.  That was until recently when I was very excited about something, and she was uncharacteristically lacking in her supportive nods.  I even made it clearer how excited I am about this one organization that I found, which is basically a dream come true for me, and her response was 0 again.  Then she didn't come to my birthday celebration.  I do know that these are not life or death issues.  I do however feel that I need to tell her that our friendship as it was before is not the same anymore.So the question was "" What is x's role in my life?""I got hex 29.2.3.5 turning into 15, modesty! Now hex 29 scares me, it just sounds very foreboding,  and in this circumstance my interpretation is that I may make a mistake in communicating that may create a very negative situation.  I can't quite see how that would be, but I am very aware that both our egos when hurt may become pretty spiteful. This has never happened between us, but it is like the saying ""still waters are deep"", I intuitively know that she is not as sweet as she would like the world to think.   The modesty part I interpret as me returning to humbleness and knowing that when I align with the truth in me, and follow the Sage, it will all be well, and this danger is more of a danger in perception than actual danger.With that said when I got today Hex 5.4<43 to a question ""how do I approach my friendship with x?"" my first impression was, I am being guided to really be honest with her in a way I have never been, and be resolute in not wanting to continue a dis ingenuous friendship.  Furthermore, I feel called to really self-examine my issue with her not supporting me, which is really at the core my own ego's desire to be approved.  If that desire wasn't there, nothing that she has done would have had any effect on me, and we would have naturally entered into the new form of our friendship, without any struggles.  And line 4 is just so foreboding!  Wow, life and death danger, that's just super intense!Please advise me as to how I may see myself, my friend, and this situation in a clearer way!  Thank you!"
530,"Dear All,I have asked the I ching to describe a certain man in my life, and the character reference it has offered is hex 34 ""Power of the Great"" lines 1,2 and 4 changing to hex 15 ""Modesty"". So it seems the IC is saying he's strong, able, but also a modest type, not a show off.Any other insights into this sequence as a character description?Many thanks for your input!"
531,As you know my jobs always seem to give me such worry. iching careerwhat if i sent my cv out for various jobs in my field21.4.6 24I can go forward with this but it isn't really what I want.what is the message i am not listening to?63.5 to 36I am danger of repeating the same mistakes over and overWhat if i work on the sign business?21.1.6 to 1621.1 Some external forces will keep me from going forward21.6Thank you for any insights on this.
532,"hi all,today I toss coins and I asked: what want that person from me?the Yi answered with 19-> 48  1.3.5 moving lineswhat I understand from the lines... is that this person want that I must be more present in it's life. that I give some more but not directly info about my feeling... and I must understand that our behavior must be adequate in every situation.I have also 2 ideas about the meaning of 48 as transformation but I'm not really sure about.any one have some idea bout?thank you"
533,"Long story short.  One of my ex boyfriend just start to contact me again after 7 years.  However, now both me and him are in serious relationships.  I mean he has his and I have mine.  I have to be honest that he's still the one that want even though I don't think there any chance (if any, would be so slim) that we can be together again.  We both have separate lives and live opposite side of the world.  So my question is ""should I continue keep in touch with him, will it do anything good for me?  Will it make me happy in a long run?""  And the answer is Hexagram 15 unchange.  So what does it mean?  Should I continue stay in touch with him?  Please advice, Thanks! "
534,"Hi all, I am planning on moving to a new city in a few months and am currently looking at the job market in that area. I have a bit of anxiety concerning my ability to find work and make a suitable living to take care of me and my daughter (single mom). My current field is real estate and with the economy being the way it is, I am worried about being able to make ends meet unless I find a stable job that will help me make ends meet.I asked yi about two different paths:should i look for a job in real estate sales?41.3>26should i look for a job in property management?50.1>14The thing is....I can find a job so much quicker in sales rather than in property management due to my not having any experience in leasing or property management. Most employers in that area prefer candidates who have at least two years experience.Of course, with sales I would not make any money until i sold a house....this would require a sizable nest egg to keep me and my daughter afloat...this is something I do not have.I am not sure what yi is trying to tell me....I know with the first reading it seems like i will find a job but the resulting 26 is a bit worrisome as it denotes anxiety.The 50.1 points to throwing out old ideas and concepts and starting new which is basically what I would be doing if I were to take on an entry level job in property management...the resulting 14 seems promising but then again, both readings do seem ""positive"" overall.Can someone help me understand or clarify what yi could be pointing out to me?Also, I have been toying with the idea of trying my hand at both areas simultaneously...doing leasing full-time while selling part-time. Just not sure if that would exhaust me or not. I just don't want to starve or end up on the street in a strange city.Namaste:bows:"
535,"Hi all, The guy I am kind of unofficially yet seem to be involved with has a pesky ex girlfriend who pops up from time to time. She sends him pictures, text messages, tells him she misses him....and yet she has a boyfriend. Go figure.Well, since the guy I am sort of seeing and I are not yet an official item, I am in a sticky position.Every time she resurfaces, he is upset. This in turn upsets me, naturally since it reminds me of how he is not over her.So, I asked yi, ""what attitude should I take in regards to this situation with this other girl?"" and received 19.1.2.6 changing to hexagram 23 as my response.Now, the guy I am in involved with lives a bit of a distance from me (in another state) but we are going to spend time together in a couple of months. I am going up to visit him for the weekend. Tres romantique, I hope. Plus, I am planning on moving up there as soon as I finish school and find a job in the city where he lives. The city where he lives is the place I have always wanted to live, so it kind of works out nicely that he is now living there.It is a bit of an atypical situation but, I am hoping it will work for the best, and he is too. Whether we do end up in a serious relationship or just remain close friends, he and I seem to be stuck with one another Back to the reading, I am wondering if lines 1 and 2 are alluding to this visit and the line 6 is telling me what attitude to take towards this person's constant need to resurface? Or if the lines are telling me how to hold onto him and just take a noble attitude of a sage as described in line 6? He is still hurting from this girl's lack of loyalty towards him....and it has not been very long since she broke up with him, so i am trying to help him cope with this as best as I can, as hard as it may be given the physical distance.The resulting 23 has me a bit stumped too. Is that just a way of yi saying for me to let that situation with her dwindle down on it's own, or maybe saying that things are undergoing a transformation or re-haul and I need to kind of hold on and wait the storm out?23 rarely scares me, but 19 kind of intimidates me a bit. Seems to allude to great promise, but like 16, it seems like a promise with little substance.If anyone can offer input, i would be most grateful.Thank you all.Namaste:bows:"
536,"I was wondering how Obama would go forward after the midterm voting.My question to the IC was: ""How will Obama do after today?""The answer: 49.4>63Line 4 Regrets vanish.One is accepted by the people.Throwing off brings good fortune.He who brings about a revolution of any kind must have the necessary authority, as well as the inner strength. Because in the end the people will only support undertakings that they know to be good. What a wonderful answer to this question Very hopefull for him too.It looks like he is going to change some things according to the will of the people. And the people will love him again.Am I seeing that right?"
537,I recently started a phd program and am having second thoughts.  I am thinking of returning to my previous job but I am unsure about this.  I got hex 4 with changing lines 4 and 6 to become hex 40.
538,"Good morning or evening as the case may be,so I have met a man and we really like each other and feel we have a great connection, however...he shows me very little physical affection but obvious likes it a lot when I show him affection.so I asked him about it and he said he is well aware that he has a problem showing affection, it has nothing to do with how he feels and he does desire to show me affection and said he just doesn't know why he doesn't/can't.So I asked  What is with his lack of affection   Hex 50.1>14Does this mean he is waiting for how the relationship is going to pan out before he shows more affection (it is only a very new relationship) making sure there is no 'rubbish' that needs to be cleared first before he lets 'possession' take place in our relationship."
539,"I asked for a Prediction (naughty). Big ""r"" Romantic if not big ""l"" Love.

540,"Hi all - my first post so be gentle!I am a long time user of the i Ching, but find myself a bit baffled by recent hexagrams and wondered if anyone could shed a bit of light for me please.I have recently cast hexagram 24 several times in answer to a question of creative progress (I am an artist) - and have had all the lines moving in some, and lines 2,3,4,5 and 6 moving in another.My understanding is that line 6 with this hexagram is in direct opposition to the other lines - in that the questioner is 'deluded' with this return, and will 'loose the way' - where as the other lines are all generally positive and at the very least pointing towards the way being 'open'.Can someone give me any clues as to why I would recieve such contrary readings? - I take the ching advice seriously but am a little unsure how to interpret this advice.!Thank you.Max"

542,"Few months ago a relationship with someone I was very excited about failed (either due to long distance or lack of interest or who knows what).  Asked Yi 'What can I do to attract a good partner into my life?' In reply, I got 54.1.2.  My interpretation of 54.1 is either that I need to lower my expectations or it simply out of my control I just need to keep on going and be open-minded.  However, I can't quiet make out 54.2 which speaks of loyalty.  I would greatly appreciate your help in this interpretation!"

544,"Hi and thanks once again for the forum. I've been in a new job for nearly 5 months now and after some initial ups and downs the situation became quite calm. I had at first taken a quite strong disliking to my manager. She was very direct and most unlike anyone I'd ever dealt with before but as time passed we got on much better. The small team I was with made me feel very welcome and their youth and enthusiasm was intoxicating. However,because of my desire to attend night-school once a week,I applied for a shift change,which was granted. My new team is very different and instead of having one manager,I now have two part time managers. One manager is affectionately referred to as the Poodle,the other is known as Rottweiler. Poodle I like,she's no push-over but by comparison to her colleague,the label does seem reasonable. Rottie likes to find fault when it doesn't exist. I tire of her immensely and have considered leaving because the situation is extremely stressful. I know I won't get transferred away from the team as I've just been moved (which is rare in its self). So what do you think the sticks are suggesting here please ?Many thanks once again - blessings to all :O)"
545,"Hey there everyone. Im currently in a situation that I feel is hopeless. You see there was someone I was incredibly attracted to. Shes said in the past that she has feelings for me but the lack of communication in the past month is a little more than disheartening. Recently she called me randomly to give her a ride home from work. She gets off at 2-3 am so it wasn't exactly the evening. Nonetheless I went, and it was apparent that it was mutually good to see each other. She said she missed me, all that jazz, and of course I said ditto.However like I said, I'm starting to lose faith in this ever going anywhere. Just trying to be logical. I asked what the best course of action would be to promote mutual happiness and got 31.1.6, but I am always making the effort, most of the time in vain.So I asked how what was the best action I could take to make myself feel better about all this. How to move on from it basically. I got 12.5, which has left me somewhat puzzled. Im no expert at interpreting this lines by any means, but a couple things about this line strike me.There are many interpretations for the first part. ""What if it Failed?"" ""Ones Extinction"" ""We May Perish!"". It says to fasten that to mulberry shoots, which I am assuming means some kind of structure this can grow on?Any insight would be helpful, I am pretty lost at this point lol. Cheers."

547,"Hi people,I want to describe one of my life situation in order to show how IC is an extraordinary divination tool.English is not my first language so i apologize if I have errors in my writing.Two days ago I was aiming to travel in the near town here in Macedonia. I should travel with some old friend with whom I was in reunion after 2 years of non-spoking. We should travel at 17h. The whole day I had some weird feeling about the whole traveling and I decide to consult the I ching. I asked, ""Should I travel with my friend""?The hexagram was 23 with changing lines 3 and 4 which resulted with hex 56.In the first place I didn't understand the meaning of the hexagrams and ask again: ""Is it there some danger on the road""? I received hex 4.1.2 and 27. Because I'm new to I ching I didn't understand that clearly is it the answer ""yes"" or ""No"" so I ask: ""Should I go on this trip""? I received hex 32 unchanging.  I decided to go. I was a little bit afraid cause the freaky feeling which I had the whole day. I said to my friend to drive carefully. Everything was all right until suddenly my friend started with strong objections and we started a verbal fight. He was angry to his girlfriend whole day and now he started with sarcastic objections on my account. We ended with separation after the trip was finished. I didn't wanted to have anything with him anymore (cause I saw some old insulting patterns in his behavior) and when I opened IC and looked into the hexagrams which I receive before the traveling I understand what IC was trying to tell me. Especially the first hexagram which I received - the hex 23 is showing the whole situation of this period of my life. When I'm looking to the lines I'm seeing how the situation begin in the line 1, than line 2 and now I received changing lines 3 and 4 which are the present situation. In line 5 and 6 I can see the future of the whole situation if I go with the flow of the Universe and the ever changing life.So, the name of the hex 23 is ""Splitting apart"". That is the separation from my friend because I saw in him some kind of secret enemy.The comment of the Line 1 is:""Inferior people are on the rise and stealthily begin their destructive burrowing from below in order to undermine the place where the superior man rests. Those followers of the ruler who remains loyal are destroyed by slander and intrigue. The situation bodes disaster, yet there is nothing to do but wait.""(from here: http://theabysmal.wordpress.com/2006/10/25/i-ching-hexagram-23/)I'm born in small town and now live and had some kind of success (I'm singer songwriter) in the capital city of Macedonia. Yesterday when I was in my born town I noticed that there're big rumors about me which are everything else but true. So the situation of line 1 began in the near past. This rumors are related with my ""friend"" with whom I was on this trip. The comment of the Line 2 is:""The power of the inferior people is growing. The danger draws close to one’s person; already there are clear indications, and rest is disturbed. Moreover, in this dangerous situation one is as yet without help or friendly advances from above or below. Extreme caution is necessary in this isolation. One must adjust to the time and promptly void the danger. Stubborn perseverance in maintaining one’s standpoint would lead to downfall.""The rumors were more and more widespread. This ""friend"" of mine was enjoying in this rumors and has helped to their growing exact in the time when I decide to reunion my friendship with him one month ago. I was thinking that even though in the past we have all kinds of disagreements that he is now changed, but I was wrong. The line 3 is changing line:Six in the third place means;He splits with them. No blame.An individual finds himself in an evil environment to which he is committed by external ties. But he has an inner relationship with a superior man, and through this he attains the stability to free himself from the way of the inferior people around him. This brings him into opposition to them of course, but that is not wrong.Here's the splitting. I found myself in evil environment and I decided to split away from this ""friend"". But I never doubt that this ""friend"" is my enemy and the whole situation helped me to reveal that. I started this new reunion with open heart and I didn't know on what IC is referring in this hexagram. After the situation, now I'm able to look into the whole period of my life.The Line 4  is changing line also.Six in the fourth place means:The bed is split up to the skin.Misfortune.Here the disaster affects not only the resting place but even the occupant. No warning or other comment is added. Misfortune has reached its peak: it can no longer be warded off.This is the situation after the splitting, i.e. these days (today, tomorrow etc). Every cause has its effect. So the effect of the whole situation is needing time.The remaining lines are:Six in the fifth place means:A shoal of fishes. Favor comes through the court ladies.Everything acts to further.here, in immediate proximity to the strong, light-giving principle at the top, the nature of the dark force undergoes a change. It no longer opposes the strong principle by means of intrigues but submits to its guidance. indeed, as the head of the other weak lines, it leads all of these to the strong line, just as a princess leads her maids-in-waiting like a shoal of fishes to her husband and thus gains his favor. Inasmuch as the lower element thus voluntarily places itself under the higher, it attains happiness and the higher also receives its due. Therefore all goes well.Nine at the top means:There is a large fruit still uneaten.The superior man receives a carriage.The house of the inferior man is split apart.Here the splitting apart reaches its end. When misfortune has spent itself, better times return. The seed of the good remains, and it is just when the fruit falls to the ground that good sprouts anew from its seed. The superior man again attains influence and effectiveness. He is supported by public opinion as if in a carriage. But the inferior man’s wickedness is visited upon himself. His house is split apart. A law of nature is at work here. Evil is not destructive to the good alone but inevitably destroys itself s well. For evil, which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to exist on its own strength alone. The inferior man himself fares best when held under control by a superior man.This is I hope the end of the whole situation. Misfortune leads to fortune. If I act according to the instructions of IC and the Universe. The Tao.This is my first viewing of the whole situation, so if you have your opinion on this and the other hexagrams which I receive, than I would be glad to here from you.Last edited: Oct 10, 2010"

550,"Hi everyone,I have been absent in the last weeks as I was travelling, and then I joined a community/ecovillage for a 3 week course on sustainability. They hold here a laboratory for real alternative ways of life and for the first time in months I feel alive and purposeful again. On the other hand, I am struggling, I feel the effect of collective psychology, specially regarding their approach to love and spirituality, and I am loosing touch with what is mine and what is imposed by the group´s culture. There are days I want to leave because I truly feel I am being brainwashed. The rest of the time I wanna move in and completely dive into their lifestyle... I feel like a pingpong ball. ah, since I arrived the symptoms of my last post on health completely disappeared… Last week I asked: What will be my connection to this place after these 3 weeks? 53. 3. 5 > 23And today again: Will I join the basic education trimester next summer? 64. 2. 4 > 23why don't I just wait and see, right? I don't thing futurology is the best use one can give to this book, but the underlying need concerns more the attitude to have now. Every 5 minutes I consider packing my bag and immediately leave. The alternative would be staying and fully embracing all the fear points that are coming up concerning this collective influence and the open (love) relationships. For anyone who has in mind my last year of posting in the forum it is clear that I am vulnerable, an emotional rack, basically the perfect candidate for some brainwashing... On the other hand, a place like this would be the ideal laboratory to work on my issues of trust and rage towards man. And my impulse to isolate myself and always flee community life. With all this in mind I read the lines in 64 as saying persisting in the community is promising, that is, coming back next summer. Even if right now I feel unable to move or find a direction (64.2). I see 64.4 as the suggestion that here could be the place to work on my long-lasting implacable shadow issues.53.5 is interesting because in 3 months I would have to speak my final decision, and then the introductory course is 3 months also. Both lines carry this idea of a woman expecting a child, which hopefully is not a literal one (!!!!) but perhaps the birth of a new way of life. 53.3 says misfortune will come from not bringing it forth, right?  But I cant ignore they both point to 23, which I connect with separation. What do you think? I am terribly confused and feeling short-sighted at the moment so I really do thank everyone's feedback or mirror of any kind. Yoana :bows:"

554,"Dear All,I am in the middle of this court case which certainly makes me feel like the person described in the hexagram - stuck in limbo with little scope for motion until the situation has run its course. I am about to launch a body of evidence to support my side of the argument, and I can safely say that the grounds for my case are true, it is the amount of supporting evidence that I am worried about - there never seems to be enough. So I'm guessing the situaton is indeed as described in line 4 - moving ahead (with whatever supporting documents I have) to avoid losing the battle.However, does this mean I will win the case? One translation (found on wengu.tartarie.com) says: ""...the power of disinterested truth is greater than all these obstacles. It carries such weight that the end is achieved, and all danger of bloodshed and all fear disappear. "" This seems good but not all interpretations I have seen are as favourable - compare, for instance the I Ching Pathfinder interpretation of line 4:""Violence. You should retreat. To prevent the descent of further chaos upon you now, use sincere and honest efforts.""Any thoughts or previous experiences on this one?Many thanks! :bows:"
555,"Hello,Somewhat stressed at the moment (28? relating hexagram, maybe indicating now as opposed to future developments) I have been open to finding things to help me and at a body mind spirit festival a detox specialist - Sandy Newbigging, (Spa of embarrassing illnesses detox man) who seems hugely successful... and kind, recommended the Ishayas Meditation which he now practices and teaches.  From what he said, it seems to be a relatively simple technique without many 'attachments' of any kind of creed/group cult etc.  Having spent 10 years in a religious cult and finally detached from it in 2005, I am wary of any group - but have been missing a meditation technique that works for me.I asked if this is a good time for me to learn the Ishayas meditation (as I still felt nervous having seen many references to it as a cult on the internet - but assured by Sandy that he has no experience of that whatsoever). I received 8 with lines 2/3 and 4.When reading Hilary's interpretation on wikiwing - it seems with line 2 that this is a good path - simple, effective and yet, line 3 is maybe more open to interpretation - mixing with non-people.  She said on rare occasions it can mean that this is what I picked up to be a neutral place - a place of no thing - such as mediation maybe - but more often than not its a place of the wrong people to mix with.  Then line 4 seems open to a positive take as well.  If the relating hexagram is about now - then that is for sure - I am undergoing huge stress at the moment and shock after shock seems to be occurring.RL Wing in line 3 says almost my own words in the question - 'at this time' and he says - The people in the environment of your inquiry are not right for you at this time.  Avoid too intimate an association with the group while manintaing an outward sociablility.  Appearing committed to these people could darken your reputation later on'.  If I was only going on that line I wouldn't even be writing this and wouldn't question doing it - I'd not do it.  But being still new to the I Ching I am not sure of the other lines 2 and 4.I think on the whole, from the reading I would say ok - lets just leave it for now.  But am open to hearing your views on this?  Thanks, HebePs In case you say return to the oracle and to the source of your question - which Hilary suggests - to retrace why you asked the question - I asked it because, to be honest, I am pretty desperate to find an anchor - with everthing disappearing around me and still no concrete plan, no plan actually, I feel that my path might be easier if I had a technique that brought me to a place of stillness and presence to better handle the outer chaos.  My techniques at the moment are very haphazard - but my faith in a loving presence is pretty solid I feel.  ... Hebe"
556,"How does he feel about attending the symphony?26.1.2.3.6 > 2 Receptive Earth.26 GREAT ACCUMULATIONS / GREAT NOURISHERUnder the conditions of Ta Ch'u it will be advantageous to be firm and correct. If its subject do no seek to enjoy his revenues in his own family with taking service at court, there will be good fortune. It will be advantageous for him to cross the great stream.GREAT SYMBOLISM- The superior man stores largely in his memory the words and deeds of former men, to subserve the accumulation of his virtue.LINE 1 shows its subject in a position of peril. It will be advantageous for him to stop his advance. = The man who wishes to go forward boldly, but who sees that circumstances oppose him, is wise not to attempt to overcome them. Waiting patiently, he will find that the situation is bound to change. LINE 2 shows a carriage with the strap under it removed. The springs of the wagon are broken. There is no virtue in trying to fight the force which is holding one back. This line is central to the lower trigram. There is no blame.//Line 2: Advance is checked just as in the third line of THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL (9). However, in the latter the restraining force is slight; thus a conflict arises between the propulsive and the restraining movement, as a result of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels, while here the restraining force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle takes place. One submits and removes the axletrees from the wagon – in other words, contents himself with waiting. In this way energy accumulates for a vigorous advance later on.LINE 3 shows its subject urging his way with good horses. It will be advantageous for him to realize the difficulty of his course, and to be firm and correct, exercising himself daily in his charioteering and methods of defense; then there will be advantage in whatever direction he may advance. = A good horse will gallop with the others. Go forward, aware of the dangers. Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily. It is favourable to have a destination. // The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man is in contact with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes forward like one good horse following another. But danger still threatens, and he must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness. Thus he must acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward, and on the other in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks.  It is good in such a pass to have a goal toward which to strive.LINE 6 shows its subject in command of the firmament of heaven. There will be progress.  //A strong horse follows the others. It is good to follow the example of a strong man. But one should still go forward cautiously, conscious of surrounding hazards and preparing oneself against unexpected attack. Above all, it is important to have a definite goal toward which one struggles. // Line 6: The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition forces its way out and achieves great success. This refers to a man who is honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the world.// There are no more obstructions. The creative power throws off the weight of the mountain. Following the way of heaven, honoured by all, the wise man achieves all that he desires and nothing stands in his way. I do not typically get predictions from the Yi but this implies a progression of events.The question regards The Man who had invited me to the symphony in September, then said maybe he couldnt go, then said he WOULD be back in time and recently told a friend (butnot me) not to count on seeing him there. So I wanted to know: how does he feel about attending the symphony and what is going on.Is this an indication of him going in the end, with line 6?Or is this just reflecting the fact that I plan to go even if he doesnt go with me?"
557,"Hi all,I asked the I ching if it will be beneficial for all involved if my boyfriend of two years is to move in. On the last two throws over this last six months I have received 45 family. Today I asked again as we need to make a final decision as he is selling his house and he will either move in with me or buy another property. I received today 20 changing into 22 I feel this reflects my feelings about it but as it's a big decision as I have children I wanted to ask your opinions please. Thanks xx"
558,"After moving to Las Vegas for my children to be closer to their father, we all realized it was a terrible idea.  All except my ex, of course...who's *VERY* angry for many reasons that we left and returned to the safety of our home.  Sadly , my ex has now decided to ""punish"" my children and me for making this choice and doing it against his will.  His behavior is atrocious..selfish, mean,  and self-centered to the point of frightening.  I discovered today that he now plan on taking me to court!!  Overall, this  isn't a bad thing bc I really should have taken him to court for child support long ago, but we had a seemingly friendly and respectful relationship, so I felt it wasn't necessary and worried it might just do damage to a good thing for my children and overall for me too. I was never concerned with getting ""all I could get"" financially from him.  He's quite wealthy and money seems to be one of the most important things in the world to him; I only cared that he helped us when we really needed it and that he was a good father to our children.  Now he's decided to wage war against me and of course odds are good he'll win whatever battle he takes on bc he's not chained by truth or integrity like I am.  In addition, (again) he has all the money to wage this war legally, while I have barely enough to support my family.  Big money for Big shot attorneys are not feasible whatsoever.  I'm scared.  My children are not only devastated at seeing this side of their father, but they are scared as well about what he's planning.I asked the IC what will the outcome of court w/ M be?41.2-->27And I asked how can I win against him in this battle?44.2.6-->31Please help me with insight on these?  I have a few thoughts, but nothing makes any order in my scatted and scared brain right now:-("
559,I tried to search for information on this in the -search- but not able to find any. What if one has five or six changing lines? Because so many are changing it gives so many different perspectives like from -great fortune- to -danger-.Would the following hexagram be more important than the changing lines giving such different perspectives..?Is there already an explanation how to interpret this? If so please let me know where I can find this.Thanks it advance.Namaste
560,"I've been struggling for the past six weeks with what seems to be a cardiac issue, but I believe that is a symptom and not the problem.  I have been given the run around by a handful of doctors.  I believe the problem is my thyroid and its levels being rather off, causing this cardiac issue, along with losing about half my hair in six weeks' time and other more personal health concerns that I won't mention here, but ones that can only be explained by a hormone imbalance, a/k/a thyroid disorder.I've been told I need to see a cardiologist.  Fine.  I call one, they don't call me back.  I see my primary care doctor and they say I have some hyphenated named syndrome that can only be resolved with a pacemaker installation and that I need to see a cardiologist too and they'll set an appointment for me.  (Keep in mind I am 40 years old, run a mile or two six days a week, eat healthily and am at an ideal weight.)That was a week ago, and I don't know who I'm supposed to see or when.  In the meantime, I call back to get records sent to an endocrinologist to deal with the thyroid and the doctor refuses, saying I need to see a cardiologist instead.  Okay....so, why are you keeping that appointment time and doctor's name a secret from me?  Is there a reason you haven't done what you promised to do yet?Frustration is high, given the run around and the fact I do not feel well.  So, I fired that primary care doctor and I have an appointment to see this new doc in 10 days.  I have also found a way to get other records to the endocrinologist and I am waiting to get an appointment with them (yet another source of frustration, as they wouldn't return calls or say they received the records until I practically hand delivered them myself).So, I asked my trusty friend, Yi ""Will Dr. F. provide me the help I have been seeking?"" and received 31.4 > 39.I take that to mean that in an environment of obstruction (hex 39) that I've been experiencing with these other doctors and their staff, he will help me.  The determination I have had to find a solution (31.4) will ultimately bring me success.  I find it interesting that Tony Crisp's interpretation of 31.4 mentions to ""guard the heart"", and isn't that what I'm literally trying to do here?  Fix the thyroid's hormonal imbalance so the cardiac problems go away, protecting my heart?  What is your take on this casting?  I appreciate your input!"

564,"Howdy.  Been a while since I was last on this site.  I hope all is well. Well, I have two questions that I have posed to the IC that have given me Hex 64.  One question is directly about a person I'm friends with, and the second question indirectly involves him.  The reason I felt the need to ask about him and a trip that will involve him is that this coming January I see some transits and  progressions in my astro chart that are a bit similar to some astrological goings on in my chart that correlated to a different friend walking out of my life in January 2007. In my first question I asked: ""What will you tell me about the near future of my friendship with B?""  I received Hex 64 with lines 1 and 4 changing to Hex 41.  Before completion changing to decrease.  Is that saying that before the end of things, perhaps the end of a friendship, I will start to see a decrease in our interaction with each other?  Or is the oracle saying that things will never really end between us, but that our interaction with each other may go on the wane for a while?After I received that answer from the oracle I felt the need to ask a question about the trip we may take together to a convention next March.  I asked:""What should I do about the prospect of going to the convention?""  The oracle gave me Hex 23 with lines 2 and 4 changing to Hex 64.  Again the oracle gives me Hex 64 but in a different position.  And Hex 23, stripping away or splitting apart.  Is the oracle saying that my friend and I will split apart?   Hex 64 confuses me with this, because I have always thought it is saying that things are not yet done/completed.  I'm not sure how something that is not yet completed fits into my friendship with B or the trip to the convention we might take together."
565,"Greetings,A couple of months ago I asked the Yi about devoting my time to writing and got 21.1.5>12 for my answer. I received great feedback regarding this reading. I asked again (realizing that devotion is a strong approach) about what the obstacle is that I must ""bite through"" and received a 22. I am not sure how to interpret this. I got another reading of 21.5>25 when I asked a more specific question today regarding writing poetry. I want to ask the Yi again what this obstacle is, but I am still trying to figure out what 22 meant from the first reading. Any insight and advice would be greatly appreciated as it usually is when I consult this forum.Thank you much,PeaceChris"

571,Hello Online Clarity I Ching community!This is my first post in about 6 years!My question was: What kind of interactions my friend would like to have with me at this point in time?Here is some background information: I happen to have a crush on my friend and don't know if it is reciprocal. She is currently going through difficult times in her life.This is the answer I got from the I Ching : 31.2 changing to 28. The answer left me a little confused.My guess was that she might be attracted to me but right now she's holding off in her interactions with me as she's going through rough times.I don't know how far off I am and if my interpretation is not just wishful-thinking.Thank you in advance for any help you might provide!
572,How can I attract this girl?  Anwer; hexagram 23 unchanging. Does it mean-no way? What can I expect from communication/contact/dating with her?  Answer 30.1.3>35Does it mean that if I want progress I should be careful and wisd we should have progress?But why then #23?
573,"I know I may get bashed for this, but I did ask another question.Before you bash me, however, let me explain why and what I asked.I spent the first half of the day yesterday with the guy in question. There seems to be a weird pull between us but also a weird stagnation -- neither of us will move. I do not want to chase or pursue aggressively, but I want to keep the water simmering, so to speak. I see it way too easy (and my tendency) to disappear. I tend to see black and white: Either I ask him out (chase/pursue) or I dont. But then it occurred to me there can be a middle ground. So I started to think about other options. How can I use my best traits without being overbearing, but to nourish a friendship and encourage it? How can I show that I'm trustworthy and not to be feared? For me, asking a man out is NOT an option... too forward, too aggressive. But what are other options?I asked the Yi what if i send him an email following up on our discussion on Saturday. The response intrigues me:12.2.4.5 > 4.YES I KNOW: FOLLY< stop asking questions. But the lines that the Yi gave in 12 suggest a progression and shift of sorts. So I wanted to discuss those.line 2: But the great man calmly bears the consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd of the inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer personally he insures the success of his fundamental principles. Play it safe/bad idea, dont contact him, dont do anything. That is how I interpret this line.line 4: Standstill is nearing the point of change into its opposite. Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself called to the task and have the necessary authority. A man who sets himself up as capable of creating order according to his own judgment could make mistakes and end in failure. But the man who is truly called to the task is favored by the conditions of the time, and all those of like mind will share in his blessing. I Presume this is talking about my desire to write an email and start a written relationship or at least open up more communication other than our one day per week interaction. (And therefore I presume this is NOT talking about the outside view of this ""relationship"", i presume it is not saying that things will change for the better soon.)If I am truly ""called to the task"" and ""favored by conditiosn"" then it will work out. The thing is: I dont know if I am, in either case.line 5: The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, has arrived. hence “Good fortune.” But such periods of transition are the very times in which we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only through greatest caution, which asks always, “What if it should fail.” When a mulberry bush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots. Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way of making success certain. I can't see how sending an email could fail, per se. It's communication, it's open, but it's not aggressive: he doesnt have to agree or go anywhere, or even reply. But it puts the ball in his court.Again, I""m prepared to hear the ""you can't consider this valid bc you got Hex 4"" argument or that i'm overthinking this or whatever, but if anyone has OTHER comments, please do share."
574,"I asked Yi how can I solve one specific problem. Answer 33.3.5>35I m confused because there is couple of diffrent interpretation of line 3Willlhelm;Nine in the third place means:A halted retreatIs nerve-wracking and dangerous.To retain people as men- and maidservantsBrings good fortune.When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action. In such a case the only expedient is to take into one’s service, so to speak, those who refuse to let one go, so that one may keep one’s initiative and not fall helplessly under their domination. but even with this expedient the situation is far from satisfactory – for what can one hope to accomplish with such servants?Alfred HuangThird NineAttached, retreats.There is illness.Adversity.Feed manservants and handmaidens:Good fortune.Attached, retreats: adversity.He is distressed and exhaustedFeed manservants and handmaidens:good fortune.He cannot do big things.The third line is a yang element at a yang place. It is firm and correct butencumbered with the two yin elements underneath it. One at this placehas already retreated from the dark forces but still attaches to the darkness.

575,"Hi guys, this is the first reading I'm sharing on here- it is important to me, and I would really appreciate some advice on the situation.Without taking too long to explain a long complicated story, lets just say this is about love- right?  So this girl and I have been doing this dance for this last year, we met and it was an incredible connection, but she was in a relationship of five years.Time's have changed, we actually ended up having affairs with eachother's friends, and actually have maintained an insanely intimate platonic friendship.  So through some chain of a-causal events we now share an apartment together, we are extremely close, so close we're practically inside eachother's souls, finishing eachother's thoughts.  It's the closest, freest and most understood either of us have ever been with anyone.Everything we have is entirely unspoken- deep unconditional love, gratitude, and a whole slew of other things.  It is one of the single most powerful life-changing connections and love's i've ever experienced.  It always has been, but it grows at an exponential rate.This is so deep, so real, I almost know it has to be two ways, we wouldn't be able to relate and connect the way we do day to day if it wasn't a mutual space we share.  One of my inklings is that she's just not ready, and probably scared- but I'm not sure if thats just my ego or projections.  So I just don't entirely know how she feels, but I do know her love for me is as new and powerful as mine is for her.. I just don't know how, but I feel it's not the right time to talk about it as she's nto too far out of a 5 year relationship and an affair that ended it, as well as my own stuff.So I asked ""Are her and I bound so share the fruit of this love that I feel so strongly it must be two ways, or am I just on my own head trip?""Yi gave me 5 with 1st yao changing to 48I feel that I get the 5 part.. it certainly isn't the right time, but I feel I'm correct in assuming it is an optimistic waiting, like the blossom is there it just needs time to flower.. at the same time I know there is a responsability on my part to not wait idly.I feel the first hexagram is saying to keep with what i've been doing.. not making our relationship about anything, but respecting boundaries, and remaining steady and focused on my frame.Now I have not encountered the well in any readings relating to love or relationships, mostly because I have not been playing that dance much lately in my life (other than this whole ordeal).  I don't want to make this too long, so I'll end my rambling there and ask for any other advice, but I can share more if anyone has any more questions.Thank you kindly for any input, am very grateful in advance.=)"
576,"Hi all, I've recently started my dream job (some of you have been very helpful in guiding and reassuring me in the past) and am now splitting my time between two countries in order to do it. This travel happens on weekly basis so I am really exhausted.  In spite of that, things have been going well but I must make sure this doesn't change. As it happens, I have a real pain of a colleague, a woman not much older than me who exhibits a certain kind of neurosis, is all over the place, quite unclear and with a really domineering attitude which I just cannot stand - especially when I spend my days battling my exhaustion as best as I can, without being fake or passive- aggressive. She's been quite unpleasant in the past, perhaps without even realizing, as she is probably the most socially inept person I've ever met. I need to stop this from affecting me primarily because I don't want my bosses to see me as a weakling and because I really want to turn this into a permanent job. So I asked what is the best way to deal with her in the future and got 49.1.2 > 28. I also asked what I should do when she is obnoxious again and got 33.3.4.6> 8. An incredibly clear message there but very tough to do. Does this mean I shouldn't worry people will see me as her pawn? But how would they not see me as such if I am seemingly ignoring her domineering attitude?All thoughts are welcome. Thank you.Last edited: Oct 10, 2010"

579,"Hello,I have had a very intense and passionate friendship with man for the past 2 years. He was not ready for a relationship so we agreed to be friends. It was fine with me until a couple of months ago when he got involved with another woman. It broke my heart. We continue to be very close and he confides in me quite a bit - in fact, he trusts me with information that he is not willing to share with his girlfriend or anyone else for that matter... but I am finding it increasingly difficult to maintain this friendship as I realize I am really in love with him. Dealing with him causes me both incredible joy and terrible pain. It has become unbearable so I recently decided to get away from him by taking up a job in a different country. Obviously, this is not easy for me... Anyway, I asked the Iching how our relationship would evolve and got 38.1.2>35. 38 is a good description of the current situation: we want different things from this relationship. 38.1 seems to say that I should let him go - which is what I'm doing - and he might come back to me. 38.2 seems to say we will meet again and 35 indicates that there will be good fortune at that point. Is my interpretation overly optimistic? Grateful for your thoughts/advice."
580,"So...nearing a Saturn Return (29 years old) and thinking about making a BIG change.  I've lived my entire life thus far on the E Coast (within an hour of Philly) and have been pretty unhappy in rural areas, suburb types, and a large city.  Not a lot of job opportunities and a lot of social frustration.  I don't really dig my family either so moving away from them is no problem.  I don't have any ties (house, killer job, boyfriend, etc) so some of my mentors have been encouraging me to get the heck outta dodge already and try something I always wanted to do.  They said W Coast or Europe which sound fine to me, though Europe doesn't seem to practical at this point for working.  As for the something I always wanted to do, I was sort of at a loss until I was searching apt ads in LA and came up with the idea of living on a boat.  I researched this a lot, took a boating class, and thought it could be doable.  Then I started to chicken out, but decided that I would take a look at some boats during my apartment search this week.I found a really nice boat, it has everything I could possibly want on it and is in great condition.  The price is higher than I had budgeted for, but if I ever were to sell it, I would make back at least twice the cost of the boat, maybe a good deal more.  It is pretty much impossible to find a boat with these amenities at this price point, I haven't seen anything close.  I asked yc about the likely outcome of buying the boat and got the scary answer of 51.2 to 54.I'm not sure if this just means I'm all in a fluster about my (risky) dream coming true, albeit with a bit of turbulence on the way, or if the whole venture is doomed to failure.  Any insight?  I need to make a decision tomorrow."
581,"Hello I'm looking for help to interpret Line 4 of Hexagram 42. My question was 'given the apparent sign in the card reading today, should I sell the farm property now and move'.  Hex 42 seems like an affirmative answer but I would like greater clarity of the changing line.

I asked i ching how moving on from the relationship would affect my long term happiness and I got 32.3>40.The message seems to be - don't end it.

(just show up)Hex 5.1.5>46This seems to say ""wait."" Hex 5 is waiting, each line indicates waiting and 46 ""waiting is good fortune""... so I will take it at face value. I guess this means ""do not go.""??2) What if I contact him before Saturday?

585,"A friend of mine in a nearby town where I graduated college left me a message saying he is thinking of renting out a room in his house (he has an extra room and could use the help on rent). I told him I am very interested via text message, but have not yet had a chance to speak with him personally.I asked the oracle, What can be expected if I move soon?I received Hexagram 19.1.3 -> 46It seems like a fairly good omen, but with some potential troubles. I am mostly concerned with just getting out of my parents' house at the moment.

586,"Hi there!my situation at work, has escalated and got worse. I have been exposed to verbal mishandling and bad treatment = mobbing.I have had enough of this situation and want to quit,but not without an indemnization.I saw a lawyer today, and have asked IC yesterday evening what seeing the lawyer will bring to me in regard to this situation. According to the lawyer I have nothing to be scared of and should get out of this unpleasant and heavy situation asap. Have put together a strategy on how to proceed towards my employer.Does 61.4 reflect effectively the fact, that as I am doing what really corresponds to my deepest needs    ( without adapting anymore, which I was used to before and am not ready anymore to accept)) I will detach myself frrm the ""group"" my employer in this case, and that the boss, which I see under Hex 10, ( a quite powerful and intimidating personality), even tough menacing, will at the end not harm me??That's what I personally read in this reading....does anyone have some more details to add?

588,"Two weeks ago my love and I agreed to seperate - no contact, no promises of return - so he could heal from some irrational shadows. So he could centre and find himself, something he knows he has done before in solitude. Giving him solitude seemed to be the last gift I could give, his wellbeing matters so much to me.But really, the conditions around the seperation confuse me emotionally - whether this is a final end or whether there is hope of reunion. He requested to be freed of all bonds to me, so as to be free to think only of his own wellbeing, conditions I'm well familiar with from healing crises of my own. I can't begrudge that need in another... so outwardly I'm making no demands, no contact, but in my heart I can't let go.I don't know whether it's right to give up on him. I don't know if it's right to hold on hope. I don't know whether he will find renewed affinity for me at the end of this crisis. I don't know whether to be inwardly loyal or walk away.Though I can't remember the specific wordings from the days before the breakup, I remember that the line 11.2 came up twice when I was seeking guidance in what to do, and 38 unchanging when I asked the best course for our relationship in the circumstances... so I was confident in our needed to attend our own wounds, but uncertain if this was to be a permanent end.Ok... I think in my mind it wasn't permanent, just the necessary next step.""Letting go"" is distinct from 'abandoning', and I wanted to make clear that while I was letting him go of his bonds to me, I wasn't abandoning him. He insisted that the seperation be abandonment. Was this just his personal definitions and pain speaking? To my mind abandonment would mean to cease loving him, and I never intended that - I just intended 'moving elsewhere' so to speak - to let him go into the space he needed.Giving confusing/conflicting information as to his own needs has been a large part of his shadow-engulfment, and part of the thing he seeks healing from. He also wanted to spare me from any more of the irrational and conflicting statements/criticisms/behaviour that were manifesting from his illness. There was no lack of love, just an overabundance of unwellness/pain.I questioned the IChing immediately after we seperated, asking too much, as usual in distress, but I recieved exactly the same response to two different posings:Will A ever return to me?Will there ever be love-unity between A and I again?49.3.5 > 51I don't know how to interpret this without just projecting my desires.Sorry, this is the short version of the tale, and it still seems long.

589,"I have been thinking of an old fling lately. I always liked him, but I am quite sure it was more me than him. He came across my facebook account as a friend suggestion, but I didn't act on it.  It has had me thinking of him again. Lately, I see our names together on advertisements, wedding announcements...I've blown it off as common names.  I've seen his favorite team on different things.  It's a fairly small college two states away.  Part of me says, I am noticing these things because he has been on my mind. My questions to I Ching:What's the likelihood that x will contact me?45.5>8What's the likely outcome if I contact x?12.1.4.5>27What's the likelihood of having a relationship with x? 13.5>30They seem promising, but I don't want to delude myself."
590,"Good morning looking for some thoughts on this...a few days ago I asked the question if this special person to me was falling in love with me (which I strongly suspect he already is or at least has deep feelings) which admittedly is an indulgent questions but he is very careful with his words and tends to be somewhat secretive(frustrating cancer men!) I got hex 30 unchanging...last night I asked Is he already in love with me and got hex 30 unchangingI took this to mean that he is cling and dependent on attention from me, which makes sense since he never opens up his feelings emotionally but won't let me go either...I ask why he doesn't tell me how he feels and got 55.6-->30that 30 again! but this line 6 seems to say maybe the feelings aren't there for me after all, or WORSE he is still clinging to an old relationship (got this from re reading old threads...) for clarification I asked is he still clinging to or grieving a previous relationship and got 4.2-->23I am kind of at a loss on this one although maybe the hex 23 signifies a previosu break-up ??? I know he has been single and dating for several years nothing serious, so i don't know hereThis is the same guy I have posted about recently and things swing up and down depending on his moods which I am okay with and willing to work through but his secretiveness about his emotionally state is lately having me question  things a bit.

591,"Today I asked:Can I or anyone do anything to improve relationship with my wife and will it improve in future?and I got 54.2.3 > 55The first part seems to be clearly saying there is nothing I can do at the moment. And I am not clear about 55. Is it saying If I become wealthy things will improve. Or is it saying even if things improve(fairly soon line three) things will then deteriorate again (if I don't keep guard). Could 54, 55 combination depict a vicious circle? 55 talks also about having many options.I am keen to have the marriage work as we have kids. I grew up to a single parent and would not want that for my kids. Sure kids adjust - but it breaks my heart to think of the kids seeing their parents separate at least while they are still fairly young. Sure I'd like to be in a 'happy' marriage but no way at the expense of my children's emotional well being.I also read someone saying that 55 is often saying to appreciate what you have now. Even if there are many options that lead to 'abundance' or 'success' in the short term (future remarriage or relationships) these too may would be also subject to the natural laws of rise and fall. Perhaps I am being consoled?I wonder sometimes if my stoic attitude stops change that is inevitable and that forbearance is not always the 'right' approach - I suppose that's why I have asked this question.

593,"I received a *group email forward* from the Man in question this morning. I have three options as I see it, and I am not sure which route is best to take.1) What if i tell him i will attend the Saturday lesson at the crack of dawn?18.6>46 Pushing Upward(line 6 - one who tends to their own affairs). I found this for it: ""Not every man has an obligation to mingle n the affairs of the world. There are some who are developed to such a degree that they are justified in letting the world go its own way and in refusing to enter public life with a view to reforming it. But this does not imply a right to remain idle r to sit back and merely criticize. Such withdrawal is justified only when we strive to realize in ourselves the higher aims of mankind. For although the sage remains distant from the turmoil of daily life, he creates incomparable human values for the future.""Argh. This is saying withdrawl would be admirable/sincere etc etc.. Yes? Tend to my affairs and do not go.RIght?2) What if i say i cannot attend lesson but can meet afterwards?29.3.5> 46Interesting the same ending hexagram.Line 3 = peril\\Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger. Escape is out of the question. Therefore we must not be misled into action, as a result of which we should only bog down deeper in the danger; disagreeable as it may be to remain in such a situation, we must wait until a way out shows itself.Line 5 = no error.\\Danger comes because one is too ambitious. In order to flow out of a ravine, water does not rise higher than the lowest point of the rim. So likewise a man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of least resistance; thus he reaches the goal. Great labors cannot be accomplished in such times; it is enough to get out of the danger. Am gathering this is the LEAST ""favorable"" option or path to take.3) What if i say i cannot go/ i made plans already? (Logic: this email came TOO late and i'm not a last minute run around kinda girl, i'm not THAT desperate for him).33Retreat>12 stagnation.Of the 3, which suggests the most positive long term outcome for me?1) So if i say yes -- I should say no (??) Am i off on this one?2) If i say can meet later -- too complicated and dangerous (altho not clear why). Pushing the envelope?3) If i say i cant go at all initially it will be favorable but 12 is more stagnation (unless i am missing subtext in 12??)"

596,"I have started consulting the I Ching again after a period of 25 years in response to an application for a job I made recently. I have been agonising over whether to take up a secondment in a chaotic, stressful department with challenging but potentially interesting work or stay with a supportive team I have been with for five years and regard as my family - though the work can sometimes be a bit boring - though there are future possibilities for change. My first question was: what effect will taking the new job have on my life. I drew 47 K'un/Oppression (exhaustion) with moving lines 1:One sits oppressed under a bare treeAnd strays into a gloomy valley.For three years one sees nothing.3: A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,And leans on thorns and thistles.He enters his house and does not see his wife.Misfortune.4: He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage. Humiliation, but the end is reached.I then asked: What effect will staying in my team have on my life?I drew: 46 Sheng/Pushing UpwardPushing upward has supreme success, One must see the great man. Fear not. Departure towards the south brings great fortune.Moving lines: 3: nine in the third place means: One pushes upward into an empty cityand 5: Perseverance brings good fortune. One pushes upwards by steps. My gut instinct was to turn the job down. Was I correct to apply such a direct interpretation?"
597,I suddenly realised that yin lines could refer to females and yang to males.

598,"Hello,I'm in retreat mode from a relationship due to some info I found out recently that makes me question the other person's honesty, and I have lost some trust.

600,"I read the other threads that resulted in the same hexagrams, but I'm having a tad of difficulty applying the meaning to my question.THis is regarding the same young man as my other recent thread, in which I had not heard from him and finally emailed, which got me an instant reply. He picked me up and took me to this sporting range where we practiced (took a lesson) for two hours, had lunch and then he drove me to my next appointment. All in all it was a fantastic Saturday.However I still don't understand my place in his life. Are we just friends, is he interested, is there a possibility of something more developing -- *how does he see me*? I am now thinking this question should be *how should I behave towards him gonig forward* but I will ask that next.So the hex 56 lines 5 and 6, i read a great deal about those. I get that the wanderer/traveller has maybe finally come home, ""Maybe the TRAVELLER finally came back to his own home or maybe he found his true home in strange lands. Maybe geting home is always at the end of the long juorney.""Notes:56.5 changes to hex 33 Retreat (or Flight in the sense of an airplane taking off). This would imply that the Wanderer manages to get his mind clear and his affairs in order so that he takes control of his situation (tactical retreat rather than becoming chaotic, dropping one's shield and sword and running away) and is able to change his aimless rambling into a search for a suitable situation.56.5 - The pheasant is a symbol of yang energy , all the sunny things and actions that are going on in the outside world. Having been unsettled in the shelter and wanting to move on, we have a bit of an about turn. The traveller shoots them down with his first arrow (the direction pointer). So he gains potential sunny nourishment (the pheasant) from the shooting down of outward activity - Losing the wanderlust, we settle inwardly for what we have.This is perhaps a sort of acceptance of what is around us for what it is and because he has made this huge step forward in understanding the wanderer gets a big pat on the back, a massive reward and recognition from those on high. ""Thus he finds friends who praise and recommend him, and in the end the prince accepts him and confers an office on him."" In some ways a new acceptance of and by the wanderer that wandering isn't actually wandering.= The 5th line the line of the king is changing from yin into yang. Fire is changing into heaven, from rationality to creativity. Here we see what the deeper grounds of somebody are. Because it is the sign of the wanderer we see his/hers positive and his/hers negatives sides.as Lise is writing; Just do the best you can and your soul will feel satisfaction and ease.And Nigel Richmond: He takes his own feeling about his reality as only a small part of it. He has hit upon something that will nourish him well, the idea is like a seed that leads him on to many things.*what is that seed*?LINE SIX:•  The bird's nest burns up. The wanderer laughs at first, Then he must needs lament and weep.Through carelessness he loses his cow. Misfortune. In the end he hears nothing.The strong line at the top, whose movement moreover tends upward, loses its foundations. Thus all gaiety leads only to losses, because the line neglects all too much the duties of a wanderer, and even injury does not make it wiser. 56.6 is simply taking support for granted, not valuing it and hence losing it... It may be to do with burning bridges but sometimes burning bridges feels a very good thing to do. I have the feeling Lise refers to this angle of it. Maybe its that the burning of bridges feels good at the time, hence at first the traveller laughs, its only later he realises ""you don't know what you got till its gone"". Maybe a warning here is not to be too hasty in burning bridges however gratifying or expedient it seems at the time.= The positive side of hex 56.6 is that it is a Yang line in the 6th place of transition to the Next--whatever its problems it is actively expressing and exhausting itself bringing about the end of this current timing and the dawning of that which develops from here on.So he is a traveller in a foreign land (this is a fact -- he's not American, and I'm in AMerica now). and he maybe is realizing what he wants now? (??)"
601,"Hi all,This is my first post, and I'm very glad to have come upon this community.  I have used the I-Ching sporadically throughout the years, though with a recent, traumatic breakup I started consulting it daily for several weeks.Although I've made many, varied inquiries (probably too many), the large part of them concern specific actions such as, ""what would be the outcome if I had flowers delivered to her"" or ""what would be the effect of sending a letter next week.""  On the other hand, there were about a dozen times where I asked a macrocosmic question about the nature of my future relationship with this person (i.e. ""what is the status of our rapport a couple of years from now"", or ""what is the long-term outlook for our relationship"".  Among these dozen inquiries, many of the hexagrams speak of ""progress"", ""advancing"", and other encouraging results (16-harmony--comes up three times as a second hexagram after moving lines).  This leads me to believe that, at the very least, healing can occur and she and I will be on good terms.However what startled me was to get the same exact divination, with the same moving lines, twice among these 12 ""larger picture"" inquiries.  I don't know what the odds of that would be, but they seem slim.  I threw hexagram 48 (the source), with transforming lines at the second and third places, which move to 8 (union).The transforming lines seem to indicate that the potential of the well's water cannot be tapped because any container used to access it has a leak, and the waters are ""muddy"" and therefore avoided.  This seems to fit exactly with my situation, as my ex has insisted on taking months off from seeing or hearing from me due to a strong reaction after discovering that I was still in touch via email with older girlfriends (no affair, but she couldn't tolerate my attention being divided in this way).  So the well of love and trust between us seem, rightly, to be inaccessible and turbid.I guess what I am stuck with wondering is if this inhibited potential implied by the transforming lines would change or improve (since they in fact change), and whether ""union"" could mean a literal reuniting of some sort, or whether there are other interpretations.  When a partner decides to move on, and asks you not to be in contact, it is difficult (and unhealthy) to live with hope--especially when she is so hurt and angry.  However the duplication of this divination is a curiosity and I am at the very least interested in exploring its meaning...and I guess waiting to see what time will bear.Thanks in advance for any of your thoughts!SteveLast edited: Oct 2, 2010"

603,"Yesterday on my way somewhere I drove by a resale shop I'd never noticed before. On the way back I stopped, but it turned out they're closed on Mondays.So today I asked (borrowing the form of Hilary's new favorite question):""What gift to me from the new shop?""The reading was hex 63 unchanging.I thought, well, hex 63 can mean ""consequences,"" so maybe 63 unchanging in this case means the shop will provide me with ""nothing of consequence"" - in other words, I won't find what I've been looking for there.But I'm never sure about unchanging hexagrams, so I asked to confirm:""How likely that means ""Nothing of Consequence"" - for example, I won't find [item I've been looking for] there?"" I got 63 unchanging again. It's whacking me over the head about something...Okay, maybe the original reading meant hex 63 in a positive sense . I quoted Bradford's key words at it:""Achieving order or perfection…finishing touches""? In other words, I WILL find [item I've been looking for] there?To this, I received hex 54 unchanging. Am now thoroughly confused. It's a resale shop, so hex 54 could mean that I'd be the ""secondary"" owner of anything I'd buy there - but that's obvious and, anyway, not what I was asking. I guess it could also be a commentary on my interpretation, trying to steer me in the proper direction about the first two readings - in other words, that I should somehow apply the concepts of ""secondary"" or ""lack of control"" to hex 63 - but I have no idea how (if that's even what it means.)Does anyone have any ideas? What am I missing? Thanks!"
604,"hi everyone!I have a reading in my hands about one of my students. There are a couple of difficult cases of kids where I work and I have consulted the IC on how to be with them but I have my doubts on this one. This is about a boy aged 10 . . he's very aggressive, most times impossible in class (he harasses and curses other kids, shouts, kicks, screams, you name it). I already had a show-down with him when I stopped him from hitting another kid but the past few days he seems to start trusting me more. I'm getting that he needs a lot of attention and the only times he's been really responsive to me is when I proposed that we go to the principal's office to treat a wound he had (he gets these really ugly wounds, they look like burns, are quite superficial but big patches in his hands and feet ).Anyway, my question was as to 'what is the best way to handle the situation with (name)' and got 22.1,3 to 23.the first thing that popped into mind was 'dress up the wounds' which is rather obvious but I'm still having some trouble with the lines. 22.3 is especially a difficult one for me. So far I had it to mean that one has to sit pretty and avoid expressing what bothers them because others are not ready (or do not want) to listen to it, so I'm guessing this says 'don't talk to the parents'? Or maybe it's about the boy that feels uncomfortable in class? (his regular teacher also has trouble and usually let's him stay in the yard when he feels like it but I think this is no solution either . .)I know my role does not leave me much room for action (22) as well as the fact that I tend to have a positive view on 22 as healing and such but I would appreciate your ideas and experiences particularly with line 3, even if radically different, before making up my mind (has it meant for example 'back off, rid of any ideas you have, you don't know what's really happening'??)would really appreciate your feedback!DoraLast edited: Oct 3, 2010"

The second Hexagram is 58 - Joy. I thought that this reading points to positive outcome but than I read in some book about I Ching from a Serbian author by name Slavinski that the dominant lines (in this case 4 and 5) of the first Hexagram are the most important. These lines are not happy at all. I didn't see here discussion about the ""Dominant lines"" and I don't know how to read this Hexagrams now?! Can you please explain what is the role of the Dominant Lines and are they more important that the Changing lines in reading, and what is your opinion about the outcome of my question according to these 2 Hexagrams?Thank you in advanceIle"

607,"Quick story.  Husband and I are separated 3 years.  I wish to eventually reconcile and do not wish to anger him.  Turns out he has a 20 year old daughter he has not acknowledged.  I was called by her uncle when her mom died.  She is wealthy and does not need anything from her father, just wants to be acknowledged and speak to him on the phone.  He has not returned their calls.  My heart breaks for this girl who would like to know more about that side of her family.  They have asked for his mom's number, but I have not felt it is in my place to give this number out.  It keeps troubling me, and I asked the IChing if I should help them contact her.

608,"Hi. I have ""environmental illness""--am not able to tolerate housing with any mold issues or typical chemical toxins, and have been having trouble finding safe housing, and was thinking of building (myself and my partner left NY last year, and since have been somewhat homeless, and checked out climates in several southern states. But every time I try a longterm hotel or a rental of a house, I don't tolerate the mold or toxins in typical places and can't stay well).Earlier this year maybe six months ago I asked the I Ching and basically got an answer to expect only small successes, not to rush into anything, and to go around obstacles the way water does. I made a cross country trip anyway which didn't work out too well.I just asked again, and I got hexagram 36 with NO MOVING LINES. I've never gotten NO moving lines. So obviously the situation is pretty static and unchanging right now and that doesn't seem too fortuitous, to get darkening of the light.Would anyone have new interpretations to add except that this difficulty is going to go on for a while, and that I'm going to continue to be ""injured"" by toxic housing for the time being or will not make real progress in my goal to find the right place to settle, buy land and build nontoxic housing? The I Ching has not been too encouraging this year, on this question, but otoh, it has been right."

610,"I ask Yi; ""how can i conciliate with ex girlfriend?Answer is 13.3.5>21Any comments?"
611,"Hello Clarity FriendsThis is a ""what happened next"" kind of post. This is the story:I was recently involved in a (not serious) car accident and my insurance company needed a copy of my driving license in order for me to get compensation for the damages. Then I realized that I didn't know where my driving license was; it was either misplaced or lost. In such cases there are time limits so I had a limited amount of time to find it and send the copy to the insurance company. So I decided to ask the Yi the following, simple, question: ""Where is my driving license?"" The answer was: 62.1,2,4,5 >43.My initial thoughts were that the driving license was not lost but misplaced and that perhaps it was ""sandwitched"" amonst other things ('the strong lines being within'), that I should look for it in 'lowly places', it was not somewhere up high, I have to do a detailed search and be thorough in order to find it. Line 1 I interpreted to mean that I should look for it where I would normally look (my car for one thing or any of my bags as sometimes I carry it in my bag). 'Remain in the nest' I interpreted to mean that it was at home, i.e. possibly in a bag. I'd also moved house at the time so it was a bit chaotic at home these days, hence the need for a detailed search. Lines 2 and 4, I couldn't understand. Line 5 seemed to me to be about seeking helpers to do the search and the shooting of the bird in the cave made me wonder if the Yi was telling me that I had to drag the lost item out of its ""hole"". After looking for it in vain and with the time pressing in on me, I posed a few more questions to the Yi in order to narrow down the search:(1) Is it at home? 42.3,4 > 13(2) Is it in my car? 45.2,5 > 40(3) Have I misplaced it somewhere at work? 29.1 > 60(4) Is it somewhere else? 62.2 >32How would you interpret these answers? Do you think that I found it in the end or not? If no one would like to guess what happened, I will tell you (later because I have to be off now, but I will).el_2"
612,"Well, it appears as though my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend's divorce is now final.  (She cheated on her Colonel husband with my boyfriend while her husband was in the middle east in the military last year.)  How do I know their divorce is complete?  I received an email under an obvious pseudonym that was seething of anger, jealousy and pure hatred towards me.  I don't know of anyone else who would send such a message and given that I was told that the divorce would be ""final the last week of September"" and I received this message on September 30th, I have to put the two together and assume this email was from her.  Apparently, the divorce settlement did not go the way she wanted it to.I informed the girlfriend's husband of the cheating when it was going on last year and provided his attorney a notarized affidavit of the story from my perspective which most likely was pretty damning to her case.  I'll bet the child custody arrangements and lack of alimony probably ticked her off.  She appears to not be very educated, is very shallow and has obviously no morals, so of course I am concerned for my personal safety.So, I forwarded the message to her husband and said that I assumed it to be her and that if anything further were to happen, there would be a restraining order filed against her immediately.  (Geesh, for some people growing older doesn't necessarily mean growing up.)I asked Yi ""What actions against me personally will happen as a result of forwarding the message to her ex-husband?"" and received 61.6 > 60.  I take it to mean that this issue is highly emotionally charged and that she gets a wakeup call of some sort, which in the context of 60 means she will back off (or I file that restraining order to limit her actions).  Or is it that this is some sort of wakeup call for me?  What do you take it to mean?  I really appreciate your input, as I know I'm too close to really look at this casting objectively."

614,"Hello everyone!I have a longlasting...well, situation with this guy I like very much. He lives in another town, we see each other occasionally, according to circumstances (we never create them) and it's a kind of a friendly, no expectations kind of thing. We enjoy each other very much, have excellent communication BUT there is also a very intense erotic atraction that has been thwarted by both of us. Why? Well... no idea. When we first met, four years ago, it sparkled right away but I was with someone else, he was with someone else and since then things have been the same: we meet, enjoy each other's company, it slowly moves into passon area and we move away from each other. And it is painful both emotionally and physically.I have asked IC how to approach the situation if I want to create an emotional relationship with him, and I got 9 > 32.Does it mean:a) this as it is now is an enduring pattern. It will always remain as it is now: this ""almost"" relationship which never actually comes to be will have the eternal duration, orb)the way to create an enduring union is to let things develop naturally.The thing between us is very strong and I would appreciate your answers so that I know should I expect something real or just move away from this ""valley of vulnerability"".Thank you."
615,"Hello there - I would very much appreciate some insight into a casting I did on Aug.26th as I am now experiencing real challenges with the action I took as a consequence.  I asked whether a certain self-development course would help me with my identified issues of insecurity, difficulties in commiting/trusting, and fear of standing on my own two feet.  The reading seemed to be quite positive and when I asked about the outcome of doing the course (aug.25th) it gave me 32. (obviously something I have real difficulty with in following things through).Looking at those moving lines with Blofeld 'the superior man is reverent and thereby strengthens his inner self' (line 2) and the yellow jacket in line 5 from all the threads and reading I did seemed to be auspicious.  Blofeld also talked about how hexagram 2 was about making friends with out own kind - which the course would give.  I felt the relating 47 was significant about how I was feeling then - stuck, blocked, not seeing the way forward. So, to cut a long strory short after all the feeling good about it and then not, etc etc the dead-line for the earlybird booking came up and I booked.But now, I feel the worst fears and pit in my stomach and although I know I've been here before, I feel trapped, I want to get out, I will do anything to get my money back (I can't apparently) and feel sick with regret.  Did I not see something in that casting - or is it just showing me my habits which will in fact be helped by this course?  I can't tell you how bad I feel about it - and all I want to do is get out.  I can't stop thinking about it and decided to ask you and see if there is a good case for turning this around in my head (for peace anyway) as perhaps I was right and did do the right thing by the casting.  But why do I feel like this now?  Can you help me here?  Did I miss something in the reading?  I do appreciate your insights, Hebe"
616,"Back in October I was asked to submit samples of a book I had begun for parents and teachers of autism spectrum disorders.

In fact, I feel as if they're telling me to forget about this angle. ""Unworthy"" and ""empty"" and ""seductive"" is what I get here.Hillary had a blog entry about 58.5 this morning, but that did not help me much, except to confirm this line has never signified valuable business offers.Perhaps I have something that is a great possession (the book idea and my current work), but these people have no intentions of doing anything about it that will benefit me.On the other hand, if I strip the lines of their moralistic verbage, could this suggest people discussing the value of a book project.Any help with this seemingly negative reading?"

I explained to Yi the situation beforehand. My answer was this:25.1.5.6 moving to 16Seems positive, but it looks like I have to tread carefully. 16 is the future hexagram, right?

621,"HeyI haven't been around much lately (many problems and a lot of work haven't really let me concentrate on anything else), but recently I've decided to ""retake"" (so to speak) the Yi for guidance.All of my next readings have to do with a relationship with a girl (and I know some people here hate relationship readings but it's probably the most asked about topic), to summarize the story, she had a boyfriend 7 years ago and after they ended the guy kept on literally harassing her to come back with him, finally after 3 years of harassment she went to his house on Monday and had sex with him (unprotected) and now she thinks she is pregnant, I had a long conversation with her about what happened and the guy and everything, and she realized that he doesn't love her but is obsessed with her (if you want details please ask, but it's a lot of information) and she decided to buy on of those ""day after"" pills.Anyways she's a great friend of mine and I've always felt some sort of love for her (the thing is that I really love her, but right now I feel that I just want her to be happy), and yesterday she told me that she couldn't have a relationship with anybody because she was still looking for the same relationship that she had with the abusive guy from above. So after that I decided to ask the Yi the following questions (and I do feel that these questions are important because yesterday and today have been extremely high synchronicity days, at least for me):1) Show me the path that I should follow in my relationship with X for the rest of this year? 64.3.4 > 18I see this as waiting for the right moment (after all right now is probably not a good time) and being very careful about what I say or do with her. I also see the 18 as working on helping her fix whatever's wrong with her (regarding her ex-boyfriend and all)2) Describe to me my current relationship with X? 49This one's kinda tricky because while I do believe that we're going through a revolution I don't really know which direction can it take.3) What should I expect from my relationship with X for the rest of this year? 34.1.2 > 62A very similar (IMHO) reading to the first, it also seems to say that there's going to be a waiting period and after that things will get better.4) What should I expect from X for the rest of this year? 34This one I honestly just don't get.Now I'm looking for some second opinion's (I'm probably biased and looking at it subjectively) and some general guidance, can anyone please help me with this??P.S.: Sorry for the long post, most of it probably wasn't really necessary."
622,"I asked the Yi: Please help me to understand if I can trust him?I got 28.2 to 31First, I want to say that I am older than him, not the other way around as the line suggests.The question comes out of my own insecurities about trusting myself - he has not done anything untrustworthy. I mostly need some help trusting myself, I think. I doubt my sense of him at times.This is the same person I wrote about in the other thread. I have since talked to him and he says he only thinks good thoughts and wishes me good things. But he says he's not having romantic feelings. Yet he admits he is easily aroused around me, he wants to be with me all the time, and I keep getting 31. We do communicate well together and can discuss anything. This is what I really like about him. But I also know what I feel and what I sense from him, which is different from what he says is true for him.Last edited: Oct 1, 2010"

626,"Hello, I have been accessing this site for the past few months and have learnt a lot about the IC through the shared readings and exploring divination sections and it has been a beautiful and enlightening journey - thank you I asked for clarity a couple of times at the start before continuing on my merry way to translate my own IC readings of which there have been many....this I have loved exploring......but I'm back again because this question is kind of the culmination, the end I feel, of this particular journey in my heart and life and I would love your assistance clarifying it.I asked the IC ""Am I going to clearly know who to choose out of L and M?"" and I received 41.1.2.3 > 52L is someone from my past who I met over three years ago and experienced an inexplicable connection with in the short time we were together, which subsequently ended disastrously! He shut me out for all these years refusing to communicate but I believe he has now finally seen the truth of our situation (and has evolved to a beautiful clear place for himself) and is ready to approach me with some explanation and a way forward. I have followed where he's at with things via the IC and through other tangible signs and I've received some pretty clear answers. I wear my part in the fallout but am still very hurt and sad at times that it has taken him so long to do the same even though I've also accepted that his journey was different to mine. So there's still a bit more I have to swallow...M is someone new who I met about 4 months ago and is the first guy I've felt such a connection with since L. I didn't consciously hang on to L all these years even though my heart did i.e. I've done my fair bit of dating and enjoyed a couple of brief relationships that fizzled out quickly, but no one has really grabbed me until M. I believe he feels the same and the gradual build up between us has been so sweet and spiritual. I can't stop thinking about him. But I also can't stop thinking about L. It has been an overwhelming and emotional 3 1/2 years and I still miss him!I'm now torn (in my heart mainly since both situations haven't really fully evolved) between the two...So 41.1.2.3 > 52Line 3 is particularly uncanny! Talking about 3 becoming 2 and some interpretations suggesting there's jealousy with 3 so it's not an appropriate situation.Karcher says about line 3:""This means the three are doubtful: If you are involved in a triangle, it will soon become a couple. If you are alone, you will soon have a friend. You acquire the Inner Companion. A time for great direction. Let yourself be led. The situation is already changing""​Any clarity would be appreciated.thanks "

628,"Hey!I've been having some problems (OK actually I haven't had any problems, just a complete communication cut) with a friend for the past 2 months, here's a little background:2 months ago a member of my family got into some trouble with the law and of course everyone in my family (including me) was extremely shocked, especially considering that he's not guilty of what he's being accused and absolutely everyone knows it, sadly he's ""guilty by association"". Anyway I called my friend and said that I needed a friend to talk to, she said ""of course, call me tomorrow and we'll grab some coffee and talk"", the next day I called her 3 times and she didn't answer the phone, she called me late at night and said that she was sorry and she was with her nephew (the kid's 4) and we'll grab the coffee the next day, the next day she didn't answer the phone and I even left her a message with her mother saying that I wanted to talk to her.Fast forward 2 months, I still haven't her anything from her and I was mad (what was I supposed to feel), so I asked the Yi: ""What's the problem in my relationship with X?"" to which I got the most complex answer I've ever gotten I got 52.1.2.3.4.5.6 > 58, now I tried tackling this the simplest way possible by saying that the lack of communication (and my unresolved feelings of anger) was draining our relationship of all the joy and happiness (seeing it also as a lack of interaction of any kind), however I feel that there's something else below that I just can't see, maybe because six changing lines are a little overwhelming for me.Does anyone see something else besides what I said?ThanxP.S.: Sorry for the long post."

I asked Yi for guidance:What would my situation look like if i got a lawyer:54.5>58It looks as a mixed answer, or maybe it means that my situation is not as bad as i see it and that if i do get a lawyer it will cause a breach of trust between me and those people, and worsen my situation, as they are the ones that make decisions anyway.What would my situation look like if i did not get a lawyer:1.5,6>34Does that mean that i should trust them and the outcome will be best overall?I don't know, i would greatly appreciate all of your insights.Thank you very much in advance."

636,"Funny that someone has brought this thread back right now.  I was just about to post a reading for 47 judgment.  Some one near and dear to me, after a lifetime of borderline depression and major mood swings has gone into desperate despondency and I don't seem to be able to help in the least.  It's almost unbearable to talk because it's an unending pessimistic tirade that makes her repeatedly ill.  She manages to makes friends for a while, get out and about, then goes through long periods of destroying everything she built.  Right now, she's in one of those, but of a depth and hopelessness that I've never seen before.  She's a talented writer/poet, an interesting painter and involved in theatre, and although now aged 86 she still makes an impact with her work and does much good for a lot of people when she's in a better frame of mind/heart.  Because this latest turn is having a bad effect on latent health problems I've been especially worried -- and she's many thousand miles away.  I asked the Yi what will be a solution for her in the shorter term and got Hex 47 unchanging.  Does this mean what it seems to mean?"

638,"I graduated from college a few months ago and moved back in with my parents after some deliberation. The goal was to save money on rent and establish the ""next move"" while being with my family. I figured to get a regular-ol'-job while living with them and save up some money from that. However, I am just now getting a call-back, for a job I applied for and followed up on over a month ago.. It may be beside the point, but I seem to have found a sort of ""comfortable rut"" in the atmosphere of being at home again. I have done a few odd jobs here and there for money and and have not had to pay for rent/food/etc., so this summer has not been very productive...at least not tangibly. I have not been as diligent as I can be in seeking employment. Anyway, my message concerns the job interview tomorrowAt the time of applying for this, I asked : Please give any advice for a job at Whole Foods. receiving Hexagram 32.4. It felt accurate: i saw the job as just a job, nothing more or less. And also, perhaps it was not the right time to be trying to get one there? (the call-back came over a month later..)With that reading in mind, I followed with: What if I do get the job at Whole Foods?"" I received Hexagram 62.4.6. A rather ominous reading I thought...maybe because I was looking at it as something just to do, and not as something to do with my heart. In any case, I dropped trying to follow up on it.Yesterday, feeling increased pressure from both myself, my parents, and my friends to really ""get my s***"" together (pardon the bluntness), I asked: How can I turn over a new leaf now? = Hexagram 9.1.6. The part about this that really gets me is, the interview is for tomorrow, the date of the Full Moon (as said in line 6). I know the Yi is not always so literal, but, this feels like it could mean something.....especially because I do not have strong feelings for this potential job. However, I am thinking it is still some sort of good fortune to have the opportunity, and I should just go with it and not ""persist"" in trying to seek other opportunities at this time.Really, this whole thing may seem a little ridiculous (some may say, hey, just DO something with your life, already!!) but I have found this weird post-college, staying-with-my-family, jobless time to be very introspective, and it is not always so easy to ""find your place"" right off the bat. Ideally I want to study alternative medicine, probably massage therapy, but this is still in a very young phase and I have not been so open about it yet, and I think I need to be. What are your thoughts on these readings? Thank you for your time and attention.fr"
639,"Hi Everyone!I hope this last week of September is giving you lots of delight.As you all know, I'm job hunting, for writing/editorial related positions.I asked the Yi two questions: Where am I likely to be in this situation at the end of October? I got 13.2 to 1Then I asked immediately afterwards: Community/fellowship with what/whom? I got 13.5 to 30.Sounds like a big deal to me, like something established, not a start-up.I then asked: What does this company do? I got 58.1.2 to 45Then I asked: What will I do there? I got 27.2.3 to 26.These answers sound like it's a publication, for sure, maybe with a community slant. It sounds pretty radical and it sounds like I'll be writing for it. But, could this also be an institution of higher learning, like a university or something?I'm asking you all, not only because I value your insights, but also because I don't want to be trapped by wishful thinking. What do you think? Am I way off the mark?"
640,"Greetings,I know this has come up before, I did this reading a while ago and got a 3 and got mixed messages from people. I still feel confused about it. I thought that by asking the Yi again what if I ended my relationship with >>>>? I would get some clarity. I got 39.4<31. I am confused as whether to read this as where I am at now is a struggle ""limping through obstacles"" or that is what I will go through if I end my relationship, but will persevere in the end and find some relief. I feel somewhat hindered in my life right now and our age difference (she's 12 years my senior) is coming to light more as far as where we want to go in life. I just turned 42 and really feel the need for a change in my life. I've felt this for some time and don't know if the changes I am seeking can exist within this relationship. we love each other and get along well so it makes it even  more difficult.I guess I get confused with these readings as to whether this is a difficult but 'right"" decision to leave or if the difficulty I am feeling within me now is something that I must work through within the context of this relationship. I would love to get some insight and advice from you."
641,"Where to begin. I met someone, there seemed to be mutual attraction. The man's best friend, and his wife, accompanied us on a group activity a week ago. At first I trusted this woman, enough to share that i was interested in the man in question. Three days later her ""support"" shifted to inexplicable declarations that I should ignore the man in question, never respond to him, assurances from her that he is unreliable, not the one for me, that she's not interested in him at all, he's not her type, oh, did she say already that she's not interested in him at all? Or that he's not her type? ANd that she feels no attraction for him. Ahem. And that things with her husband (his best friend) are strained, they married too quickly, htere's no love, and her husband isnt as active and outgoing as the man in question. But she's not interested in him. But neither should i be.What is her role in this? 8.5>2I take it as me being the hunted, lead towards the gate. She's the King, directing the events.HOw should i proceed? 8.5>2.Hmmm. Same thing. Is it possible to interpret the same hexes in two ways for different questions/answers? If so, I would guess this means do not lead, but go on my own path, decide what i want and do it, and do not take direction from her.Needless to say i'm not trusting her again but what began very promising is now exploding in my face, thanks to her. Other interpretations of these hexes?As more background, he had invited me after a birthday party to two events. One was what turned out to be last Saturday's group sport activity. I was thrilled just to be with him. But now he seems to be suggesting this continue as an ongoing group thing, and is treating me (i feel) more as a friend. That may be fine, but I do not know how to read him. The second was an invitation (at the bday party, as we parted) to take me to the symphony. However yesterday he sent me an email ""remember the concert i mentioned/ Here is the link. I have a conference in X city the 3 days prior so dont know if i can make it.""WHat is M's position in all this? 63.1.5>15He is pulling back and modest. Can i interpret this as NOT Interested or having lost interest (due to the lies the friend's wife has been telling him about me?)Last edited: Sep 24, 2010"
642,"Dear I-Ching community,I wrote some time ago to ask for your help interpreting the I-Ching about the future of a potential relationship with a much younger man that I had met. As Willowfox suggested, nothing happened.Now I'm back again with a 'heart' issue, and would appreciate your help with the interpretation. I recently met a man from my past (after 18 years!) and I felt a very strong connection to him. I believe this feeling was reciprocal. He also gave the impression that he's not happy in his marriage. I admit I felt stupid and uneasy asking the I-Ching the following question, but I still did, because my heart has a very loud voice at the moment... The question was: ""Will XYZ leave his wife and get together with me?"". The answer was: hexagram 63 'after completion' followed by hexagram 13 'concording people'.I would appreciate if you could help me with the interpretation, even if it's bad news.  It helped me last time keep my head cool Kind regards"
643,"Hello!I'm new to this community, but have been searching for guidance all over the Internet, which can be a very dangerous thing to do! My husband and I have been separated for 11 months. Barriers to our marriage of two years (one of which we've spent apart) were active drug addiction, financial difficulties, stepparenting and inlaw issues. Neither of us are spring chickens either. We recently, together, threw Hexagram 28. This was changing into Hexagram 21. Any advice? At one glance it appears that we must throw in the towel. At the next it appears that one or both of us must take decisive action one way or another. I have to also add that we got Hexagram 21 the last time we asked. Thanks so much for any help you can give. I do not know much about this."

650,"Hello Everyone! I hope you're all doing well and thoroughly enjoying your September. Finally, a lead! I'm re-signing up with a temp agency I worked for years ago tomorrow and, hopefully they'll find me some assignments, so I can start earning money.That is AWESOME, as it would take a load off to be able to rely on income coming in, as not having any money to take care of overhead or to just have a BASIC social life is driving me insane.This is a total blessing, but surprisingly this unleashed a new whirlwind of anxiety for me. Long story short, I don't want to get trapped doing admin work for the rest of my life. I've got skills that I've actively developed over the past five years and I just think it would tear my soul apart if I can't do a 9 to 5 writing or editing. I know California's job market is in the pits right now and that L.A. is not really publishing friendly, but still, I've got to put my skills to use, so that I can ENJOY my life. I've been actively applying for writing/editing related opportunities the past two months, but still waiting to hear something.I asked ""What do I need to know about this month's writing/editorial professional situation?"" I got 47 unchanging. (OK, this is how I'm feeling right now)Then I asked, ""Why will conditions be so adverse this month?"" I got 49.1.3.4 to 8.The answer to the second question really confused me, because it suggests a huge change in lifestyle/environment. I guess this could be related to any job really, but I specifially asked about writing/editing work. It also suggests unity with something.So, what does this mean?I would really appreciate your insights. Thank you."

653,"Hello community,I'm in a relationship with X since 1.5 years. The love is there, but I wonder if that's enough to keep the relationship together. We are two very different people and the reason we survived together this long is because we are both willing to make the effort. Still, I can't escape the feeling that my life has been put on hold since we are together. We started our relationship around the same time that I made an arrangement to settle my debts. They were growing over my head,so I decided to take a drastic measure to settle my debt as soon and correct as possible. I now have a 'mediator' a lawyer who controls my budget and negotiated a settlement with my creditors. Because of this my social life became very limited. It's been rough but I've accepted my current way of ife and I think I'm handling it okay for the moment.  X moved in with me around the same time I made this arrangement and naturally he had to adapt to my financial limitations. He comes from a sheltered home and had some trouble adapting to this new situation. We keep our finances separated because I want to settle my debt by myself.  Our problems: We both work fulltime yet by the end of almost every month he has to lean on me for household money and the like. He likes to go out and party during weekends, something I used to love doing as well, but this last year has changed me on so many levels, my priorities completely changed. I prefer a quiet evening at home over drinking in the local pub these days. Because I made the change from living in abundance to living a simple, sober life I parted ways with some of my friends and acquaintances. This has isolated me a bit. It was a conscious decision and one I do not regret, because many of these former contacts seem rather empty to me now, when I look back at them. I think I'm not the same person I was a year ago and part of our problem is because I changed so radically. He has to deal with that and and most of the time he respects me for it. It also meant he had to evolve with me and there, I believe, lies our biggest problem. He experiences live on a completely different level then me and sometimes he tells me he feels he is not good enough for me.  We are working on our relationship and I find myself in need of advice again from the Yi.I asked:'What forces are at work in this relationship?' Receiving Hex 55>4.5 63   Hex 55 marks the peak of a cycle. Does this mean the relationship has reached it's peak? Is this as good as it gets? We've reached the top of our potential together and we have to accept our 'midday sun will wane'?Moving line 4: This sentence from Lise got me thinking: 'Sometimes the very things which hold us back contain the energy which can help us to gather the strength to go on.' Maybe this speaks of my debt holding us back? But my debts also 'forced' me in a new situation where I find new spiritual and emotional depth, making me in my eyes a richer person; ?Moving line 5: (Lise) Recognition comes, bringing reward and praise.I can gather strenght from my newfound awareness and influence X to grow with me?Hex 63: If we stay vigilant and keep working, adapting and growing in our relationship we can foresee misfortune and guard against it.Is this just wishful thinking folks? All input is welcome!  Warmest regardsMyladythunder"
654,"I have a female friend that I like very much and our friendship was going well in terms of communication and understanding each other.Since some time now I was wondering if our friendship can be something more. I always liked her very much and started to think that we could become closer but I had a feeling I really don't know everything about her.So I asked I Ching some questions:- What can be a description of our relationship: 17.2.5 -> 54- What is my position in this relationship: 55.5.6 -> 13- What is her position in this relationship: 55.6 -> 30I do not have a great experience with interpretations but what I understand is that this friendship is a good thing and I should leave it like this for the moment. 54 tells me that there cannot be a future together. As for the other questions i understand that if I will try to get romantically involved I might ruin our frienship.A little confused about last two questions getting the same hexagram, even with different changing lines. If I have questions about moving further the relation does this mean she thinks something similar? Any other insights from you?"

658,"Hello, all.  I recently consulted the IC asking if two people I knew were going to get divorced.  I received 18.3.4.5 > 6.   Sometimes the IC really just knocks me out.  But I want to make sure my interpretation is not skewed by emotional bias, because I am friends with one of the people involved.  What would you make of this result?I had read this thread...http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=3633...and it was very interesting, especially considering this marriage was born not out of love, but out of a desire of my friend to ensure their child didn't grow up in the kind of broken home they were raised in ('the mistakes of the father'?).  They weren't happy before they married, but seemed to believe getting married would ensure the child would not have to endure the kind of upbringing they did.But I could also see this 'working on what has been spoiled' to mean work on what has been spoiled within the marriage itself, not what was spoiled within the person years ago.  I've been working with the IC for a few years and I still feel like such a novice."

662,"It's either a major epiphany or I'm just up way too late tonight/this morning.  Last January, I took a trip to find myself after ending a 7.5 year (bad) relationship.  On this journey, I was taught how to be a dog musher.  I figured the cold climate, spending time with nature and being in an unfamiliar situation would help me to reconnect and rely on myself once more as the strong woman I once was.One of the nights on this trip, I sat in the snow on the banks of a frozen lake, watching the sun set.  It was a symbolic gesture, but I let myself have one final catharsis over the previous relationship and the pain associated with it.  Once I felt as though it was out of my system, I made some serious decisions about my relationships in the future.  Through the fear and the subsequent tears, I also promised myself some things as well as to the man I will fall in love with in the future (who was unknown even then as it still is now).Tonight I found myself thinking of those promises.  I asked the IC if the promises I made to the unknown man in January was actually Rodney.  The answer I received reminded me of a couple of lines from the movie ""Field of Dreams"".  It was the part where Ray Kinsella is asking Shoeless Joe Jackson what the ""Ease his pain"" message meant.  Ray says to Shoeless Joe as he's about to enter the cornfield, ""It was you...""  To this, Shoeless Joe pauses, turns and looks at Ray, who is at the other side of the field.  ""No, Ray.  It was you.""Yi gave me a 61.3 > 9.  I take this to mean it was saying that the promise was actually made to myself.  (This promise I made had to do with the way I define love in the future and keeping those metaphorical ""walls"" down to actually let love in fully.)  I also read into it that a lot of change surrounded me at the time I said those words (very true) and that the love I could feel in the future for someone else really starts with loving myself first.  Wow.  What a casting!  So beautiful, so moving...at least that's how I read it.  Just had to share this with you.:bows:"

I'm 52 years old, so it seems that there is more behind me than ahead. I asked the I Ching, ""What does the world need from me,"" and received 44.5 > 50.

667,"36.6 to 22Hi there, I asked the i ching for advice in relation to dealing with a confrontation at work. Basically this lady has been criticising me in team meetings or across the room so everyone could hear every day for about a week and a half. Before I approached her I asked for advice and the i ching gave me 7.2.3 to 15. I don't think the approach went too well. It ended up with her yelling at me and then our boss organised a meeting with the two of us for early next week. I didn't organise my thoughts very well (as 7 might advise) before I approached her. So I asked for further advice in how to deal with the conflict, since having the confrontation and I got 36.6 to 22. What do you think this last reading implies?BarbalootLast edited: Sep 15, 2010"
668,"Hello,It's been a while since I've contributed anything here but I'm still carrying the I ching along with me  I have started using the marble method too, which is apparently more accurate than 3 coins because the process makes it most likely for you to produce an unchanging yin line, which due to the passive nature of yin, is less likely to move than an acive yang line.. thus you're least likely to get a yin changing to a yang line.. anyhoo. It does feel different doing it this way actually... softer answers maybe or that could be in my head.I feel I have three choices ahead of me but I have a feeling I'm not the one in the driving seat anyway so maybe I needn't fret so much. I'm relaxing at home at the moment but looking to leave soon, although not sure what'd be most suited to me - or favourable given the current climate (of my abilities and needs as well as the economic climate etc.)1. Pursue living abroad even if I don't get my ideal position (as a writer/editor in an educational institution) and have to teach English again (which I kind of enjoyed in China but I don't feel I was the best at it - but I had a lot of fun and travelling in general is always so rewarding!)2.2 > 7Looking into this line it seems to be advising to let nature take it's course - 'things evolve as they should' - and no need to study and rehearse? (Although I'm sure I will have to if I want to be a good teacher, which I don't feel wholeheartedly inclined to do at the moment) It talks about repetition - which would be the case as I taught English in China recently. As a means to be paid? But then it also says 'Doing nothing nothing not done'? Confusing line for me. Maybe it means whatever I relax into. (I am also waiting to hear from the writer/editor position about an interview, so it does depend on them) so I should let myself be guided?2. Pursue work experience with a literary agency in London and then look for jobs in publishing? (ie. start on my 'career' and stay in Britain). Appeals because of the idea of independency and making money and pursuing my interest. 2.1,2 > 19Same line plus 2.1! Which seems to mean if I follow this path it'll solidify and I'll be on firm ground - supported and stable. And it'd also be a period of growth and profit if I follow this course. I guess it's kind of the most sensible of the three. But also maybe that it could dominate my life and I'd find it hard to get out of? I.e. I wouldn't be able to go gallavanting off and I wouldn't be as free as I've been in my life up till now... entering the world of 9-5 etc, and staying there? 3. Finally, I have been attending creative writing classes, on and off, and really enjoy them. I'd like to think myself a writer, (budding that is), but I don't know if I can justify it because I don't feel that I'm good at writing stories, in day-to-day life when I have spare time I am not excited or compelled to write (though i wish I was), but then again I often write sentences and dialogues, and have ideas, just when I start writing a story with actually characters etc. I start to lose interest and stop short, or keep going but not seem to be able to write what I enjoy reading myself! Although I do get praise and encouragement from my creative writing tutor, I guess I don't believe it that much.I asked what if I stayed home and saved money (which has the danger of me going mad at home though and possibly feel deprived of experiences and people etc) for doing a Masters in Creative writing next year in the University of East Anglia (Norwich) which my tutor told me was the best place to study. Thing is, it's stupidly expensive (writing MAs being almost £1000 more than other MAs for some reason!) And I'm not sure if I have enough talent to justify doing it, and it seems a bit frivolous considering... But then again, I'm pretty sure it'd put me on the best footing to prioritize writing. And maybe you just need to get into the habit of writing stories. I often think, when I start, oh this plot-line has been done before etc., but I guess most are recycled but that doesn't stop you enjoying it, if the writing is different and of an original view-point etc. I love reading novels - especially realistic ones - and don't get bored, but when I try to write my own, I kind of get bored... or at least too philosophical and introspective rather than writing about action and describing characters and settings etc..It's just with publishing, I'd be looking for editing positions which I have experience in and enjoy when I'm editing something interesting, but you're basically reading something that came from someone else and not having to think much. Although I have a passion for literature and would love to read manuscripts etc and give criticism etc.I received: 35.1,3,6 > 55Could this be saying that though I lack self-confidence in my ability (35.1), I'll have support (35.3) but it'll require really going for it (and I could go OTT ie. spending lots of money on it?) (35.6) Perhaps if I didn't try at least, I'd regret it down the line?And could hex 55 be suggesting it'd be a good opportunity to take advantage of doing now while I'm young and without responsibility? Or that real life will eclipse the idea? Or I'd reach a peak, maybe I already have, and my interest and ability to write would wane?I often think maybe I need to live life more, have more experience, before I could write properly anyway. I think if you want to be a writer it's important to say yes to things, so that you have lots of situations to draw upon etc.I would really appreciate any advice re these lines. Not 100% sure. I don't think any of them are bad or warning me off any of the three, or am I not seeing something?Thanks for your help and for reading!:bows:Last edited: Aug 29, 2010"

The outcome/reading seems quite positive but I'm not quite sure what is actually required of me... What is the iching advising me to do here? Thanks for your help."
673,"Asked a No-No question - in other words a ""yes or no"" question.But nonetheless it's a significant one i'd like to get a explanation on. The question was:Will X ever end?Verbatim: ""Will X ever stop""Response was:1.3 - > 10. To me it looks ominous. Hoping for an ending with these symbols looks like a lost cause. I see both unending and untiring in hexagram 1 - and in the line it describes. Furthermore I see the dynamic of what I inquired about reflected in hexagram 10. What are your thoughts? Any comments appreciated."
674,"Greetings,Can some one clarify a bit more about my reading today?I questioned the I Ching about if I should accept partnership proposal related to my work. I work with therapies and that would mean to have my own space - A thing that I want for some time.After the reading that's what came up:Hexagram 28.4I understand that it's a decision that has to be taken in the next days, and I should not postpone it.The changing line produced the Hexagram 48. The well, for me is something like be still, let things come to you, be sure of your resources.I can't figure out if I should decide quick but be aware of my resources as a main factor for my decision or just decide but don't take the proposal being like a well then - full of resources because he doesn't move.Does it make sense?Thanks in advancelazevLast edited: Sep 11, 2010"
675,"greetings clarity community,for the past six months i have been moving through one of the most challenging transitions of my life.  a series of events occurred simultaneously that levied a tremendous stress on my life leaving me to change (grow up) or to retreat and repeat past behavior that has caused myself and others pain and suffering in the past.  i have chosen to grow up  one of those stresses was a split in a relationship.  i cannot say that the relationship has ended for no formal parting of ways has been made nor have we broken off communicating (although very little if any real communication occurs at this time).early into this transition i had a professional divination performed for me.  this, as well as all subsequent readings (done by myself) have indicated to stay the course and be open to a reunion.  it was indicated that we would be back together sometime this winter.  and the readings have consistently advised me not to initiate anything - this has been exceedingly difficult but beneficial, for it is teaching me to be ok with myself and being alone with out jumping into another relationship to escape the loneliness.so now at 6 months i ask for the community's experience and wisdom in navigating my current situation with the aspiration of loving kindness and compassion for both  m and i.these are my most current inquiries (i personally use karcher's total iching and cleary's buddhist iching as references):what would a future relationship be like between m and i?1.4.5 - 26How long will it be before m and i are reunited as a couple again?48what can i do to facilitate the reunion?58.2.3.5 - 55please accept my deep gratitude for all of those who have helped and advised me in the past.  i am humbled by your selfless gifts of experience and wisdom and with deepest appreciation say thank you.  you all do a tremendous service.~mp.s.i have looked into the threads that describe how to determine the time that a reading will come to fruition but for the life of me cannot seem to crack its code.  any insight or guidance you have on this topic will of course be most deeply appreciated.p.p.sadditionally this transition experience will serve as a touchstone in my relationship to the yi.  i have worked with the yi for nearly 20 years and this will be the first time (to the best of my ability) that i followed the yi with out deviating from it.  i will post the ultimate out-come of all this, especially as it relates to the yi's direction, for all those interested."
676,"Go Back to School 18I have been feeling somewhat stuck with the direction of my career for some time and feel the need to change directions. Whether I stay in the same field or not and go back to school in general are questions I've been considering.I asked the Yi the general question "" What if I went back to school?"" and got 58. This seems like a ""go"" to me.I then asked "" What if I got an advanced degree?"" ( A Masters in counseling is a consideration) and got 18. This is confusing to me.I narrowed the question to ""What if I studied Hellerwork?"" (This would involve continuing education in my field of bodywork, but not an advanced degree. It would take it to another level and involve a commitment of 1-2 years. I got 57,1.6,4.6>1.I know this me seems like a lot, but I am trying to converse with Yi to get a better idea as to how I ought to proceed. I am feeling a pull towards furthering my education and don't know if revitalizing my current field as a body worker is what I ought to do, or change directions entirely. I come from a family of Doctors and counselors, so that direction seems natural, but not much of a risk as far as exploring new territory altogether. There's part of me that says I ought to let it all go and open myself up to what signs start to manifest in my life and head that direction. I would love to have any advice or input on these readings. Hex 18 and 57 here are a little confusing to me.ThanksChris:Last edited: Sep 13, 2010"
677,"Hi. I have been hoping for a long time now to fix my relationship with my ex. I asked the iching what the best way to approah him would be, as I have been unable so far to find an appropriate time/place to broach this with him.The answer I received was 8 unchanging.  I am not certain how to interpret this as it seems more like the end result I would like, rather than the means to get there.Then, as 8 encourages a second reading about one's own qualities regarding this union, I cast again and received 56.5>33. While line 5 seemed promising, I was troubled by the image of retreat in 33.I would greatly appreciate any help in interpreting these readings. Thank you in advance for your time."

679,"Hello, I am completely new to IChing. I started playing with it a little bit, then i stubmled upon your website, and found readings to be extremely accurate. I also love the amount of wisdom and good will comming from this site. I am in a place in my life where it is very difficult for me to get help choosing the right path, succeed without having to sacrifice my ideals.

681,"Hello everyone.  It's been a little while since I've been here.  I have a really serious health issue that's been keeping me up for a few nights.  About 7 months ago I found a lump in my breast but knew that some sort of mass has always been there since my early twenties and didn't think too much of it.  Lately, it's been really bothering me - mentally, not physically - and so I went in for a checkup.  The doctor doesn't seem too concerned, even though the lump is the size of golf ball, citing various reasons - the physical signs aren't there in the lump for cancer apparently but he's sending me for testing.  I can't get in for tests until the end of the week and now I'm just so worried that I can't sleep. So I consulted the yi and asked - is the lump in my breast cancer?  It gave me hexagram 61 changing at line 2 to hexagram 42.  The second hexagram 42 really scares me for some reason - increase.  Wow.  Could someone please help me with this? Thanks.

682,"Going with Pato's suggestion of being more specific after a few days non-questioning, I asked 'what should my next step be with finding work' and got 25.  This seems to tie in with how I was feeling about the approach - a gut feeling about the unexpected.  Hilary's translation was a bit more confusing as she seems to suggest that a more organised approach is within the 25 hexagram - not just a purely open-minded innocence.  I keep feeling to just be open to opportunities rather than planning some kind of CV related job search, which from my understanding of 25 - or reading through the various threads and the books that I've got, is ok.  I've just been stung on my right boob again as I type this... what's going on here?  I was stung 3 times by a wasp a few weeks ago in the same place.... OUCH!I asked a bit more specifically about a possible opportunity I've been thinking about and got 62: 2, 5 and 6 - 44.  This was probably worded incorrectly - my question - that is.  Because I have been so indecisive about it  I asked what would the wise man do in my situation with this opportunity?  I have read so much now on 62 and am totally confused about whether its a good thing or not.  So many different interpretations of the line.  When I originally asked about whether this opportunity would help me with my lack of direction it gave me 2: 4 and 6.  I wanted to go ahead with it, but waited and waited for a few weeks and then asked the above question as I couldn't seem to make a decsion.I know I sound very confused and I am.  I just want to find a path forward that I can commit to and not get so overwhelmed by decisions or paralysed by fear.  It might look as though I'm not looking into the answers as I don't give my thoughts on the lines, but after reading so many interpretations I get so lost its hopeless.Over and out - any suggestions whatsoever would be really appreciated, Hebe."

684,"I am posting this question again in a simpler way so that I can understand better about hexagrams 55 and 22. I once asked about changing my medical insurance to Plan B and got 22.4.6 > 55. The background: The insurance I have now, Plan A, is a simple, affordable policy. It is perhaps too simple and too low-cost, because some doctors have told me they don't like it and won't be accepting it in the future from new patients. It doesn't pay them enough money.  Plan B is significantly more expensive. A friend told me about Plan B. The way she referred to it, she implied of course she has Plan B -- as if that's what everybody should have, if they can afford it.  Hexagram 22 has to do with the outside form of things, and about making refinements. I don't know how it is in your country, but here, medical insurance can involve a lot of claim forms. Will Plan B be too expensive for me? Hexagram 55 often signifies too much of something.Alternatively, it could be that Plan B represents a refinement over what I have now. This refinement could be more in keeping with where I am in my financial life, in a relative state of abundance, 55.Pease do not think I want your feedback to buy medical insurance! I am more interested in improving my understanding of hexagrams 55 and 22.  I have never understood line 22.4, for example. Last edited: Sep 10, 2010"
685,"Hi there,I asked the above question about troubled relationship with gfriend and the answer was:Hexagram 47 Oppression with changing lines 2 and 4.Resulting Hexagram from Changing Lines: 8 Holding together.The resulting hexagram said to ask the Oracle again if I have the right qualities to lead this community (the family with step children), so I asked the question: ""Am I fit and right for this family...""The answer I got was:Hexagram 63 After Completion with line 1 changing giving the resulting hexagram 39 Obstruction...All this makes sense because the relationship is quite oppressive and I resently came back from travelling and moved in (hence the ""after completion""), but we've had many arguments and problems, not less financial but also emotional.Line 1 shows that we moved too fast and put pressure on ourselves and the resulting hexagram says better to retreat - which is co-incidental because I was looking to go on a retreat to heal myself and see if we can move forward - but unlikely because I've lost attraction and still have issues with arguments we've had...Your advice most welcome!Thank you and lots of love and light,Casparky..."
686,"I've had this thought pop into my head on several occasions during the past year, and now that I've seemingly got my health problems under control, maybe I should pursue it.  What thought is this, you ask?  I've been thinking of running a 5k.  Perhaps it's not that big of a deal for some of you, but the last time I ran one I was 26 years old.  (I'm now 40!)Even if I'm not able to run it all, I know I'm healthy enough to walk the distance.  But it would be cool to say I ran the entire 5k.  Of course, I'd like to have my furry companion at my side as well.  So, I asked the IC ""Will I be successful in running a 5k with the dog this October?"" and got 43.2.5>55.I interpret that as meaning I should be alert for any health issues that could pop up for either of us (injuries, etc.), it won't be easy but I shouldn't give up and push through any obstacles encountered and ultimately we will be successful.

689,"Hi everyone,Being in a bit of a crossroad where I felt called to choose between my various artistic inclinations, because I just don't have time and energy to take them all simultaneous to the next level, I started investing more in my dancing. I am dancing professionally, I really really work hard, but I'm just one more, a medium level highly dedicated and passionate one, but one more in the crowd. That's not a problem per se, I truly am in it for the dancing, I love it. What bothers me is if I'm not gonna take my career far and in some years the body's potential is extinguished, maybe I could already take a turn here and invest more on the other skills I somehow left behind. And take dancing more occasionally-informally...So I asked,Am I on a path of becoming a high level advanced dancer? 37  1. 3. 5. > 23This felt good...!It felt like there is still many stages and phases to go through but ultimately line5 feels very positive. L1 can describe my introduction above, when I gathered my inner family, all my artistic members within, and secluded them inside dancing. There was no remorse in this.  Now L3 is very puzzling to me. It talks about discipline but not being overly severe, but as well mentions this child and this woman that take it to lightly and that brings them humiliation. Is this a warning I shouldn't have fun and play around? Well, I'm actually know for being able to work really hard and have a giggle at the same time, will this become a problem? What could be the King in line5 my own inner authority, or someone exterior?And how do you see this 23 here? I'm always a bit afraid of this hexagram, it sounds so violent...

690,"Hi everyone,Someone new as entered my life. It felt good to start with, a very gentle and caring man, but as time progresses I don't see my feelings growing any deeper, and I'm often having doubts about what is it I am feeling.I asked for an overall image of what's up in this relationship and got18 (2,3) > 23I know I have a lot of repair to do in myself and my emotional life, if that is what line 2 points to, me being the mother; but line 3 also refers a father. Him? He seems pretty stable and emotionally resolved...  Are we coming together for some sort of mutual emotional healing? We do treat each other awfully nice....23 doesn't sound so promising... could we be stripping away old wounds? What is the best approach i can have towards this new relationship?7 (2,5) > 8 somehow I read this as a suggestion to stay at the center of action, perhaps also centered in the multiplicity of my feelings, line 5 says there is game in this field, but I should avoid talking about my (lack of) deep engagement... the older person will govern the army, that is no doubt him, he is 20 years older than me. But I carry the corpses? What could that possibly mean...?? Hum, persistence finds pitfalls...I have mixed feelings about these responses, which only mirror my own mixed feelings. Overall this doesn't sound very promising or long lasting, but there is a sense of ""go for it"", at least in 7.2.... perhaps we should stay united (8) until the decayed has been repaired (18) ?That could be a lifetime Thank you for your views...

691,"Well, as many of you have read on Clarity, I've had this on again/off again relationship with Terry that seems to be going nowhere for many months.  So, as any gal with pride would do, I've picked myself up, dusted off and I am moving on.  It seems as though nothing is going to happen with Terry, unfortunately.  I love the fella, but the time just isn't right for us, I'm convinced.So, I put myself up on a dating website and met up with a guy named Rodney.  We immediately hit it off and have been talking daily for nearly a week now.  So far, so good.  I think we shall meet in the very near future (which I'm both excited and scared of at the same time).  It seems as though we have a lot in common and he has this charming quick wit.I asked the IC today, ""What are the romantic possibilities with Rodney?"" and got 31.2.4 > 37.  I take that to mean that there is an attraction there and it has kind of knocked us for a loop.  I think that also means the possibility exists for a deep connection, but right now we're not sure where to start as it is an overwhelming feeling.I asked if I would be attracted to him when we meet and got a 30.2.4 > 26.

692,"Hello I Ching Community,For the moment I have a temporary job. Mean while I'm on the look out for a job that provides more security also very important, a job where I will feel better as a person. Last week I had a very positive job interview and yesterday the company confirmed I could go through to the next round. They invited me to participate on an assessment the coming week. This assessment will take all day, so I will have to inform my current employer and ask him for the day off. Also, if I get the job, they will want me to start asap. I'm bounded to my current contract until the end of October. Belgian social law is very clear in cases like this, if i choose to break the contract I owe my current employer the salary they would have paid me from the moment I leave until the end of the contract. There is a loophole in Belgian law however, if I go on sick leave for over 7 days, the employer has the right to break the contract immediately with no compensation for neither party. It's a complicated situation and I could have asked several different questions but I chose to ask the Yi for advice generally concerning my situation. So i asked the Yi: What course of action to take?Hexagram 17.4 -> 3LiSe commentary:9 at 4:  Pursuing brings a catch. Determination pitfall. Be true on your road and use intelligence. No need to feel faulty.     Pursuing brings a catch -> I should go for the jobDetermination pitfall -> Not sure on this one. Maybe when I break the news to my current employer I should try to look for a compromise instead of 'blindly determined' go for this job?Be true on your road and use intelligence ->Be honest about to current employer instead of using my 'loophole' in Belgian law. No need to feel faulty. -> I'm in my right looking for a job with more security and there's no need to feel guilty about it?All input is very welcome  Myladythunder"
693,"Hi everyone,A dear friend of mine who is also a dancer recently had a severe problem in her knee and cannot dance again. She was one of the best in the company, and still young enough to know she would enjoy a good couple years more in her career. So you imagine how this come as a shattering life event for her... She has been coming over at my place often, I am trying to support her as best as I can, as I also quit not long ago and know how difficult it can be to start afresh ""out there"" in the ""real world"" as we call it... She never used the I Ching but kept insisting I'd introduce her to it. I told her I was not the ideal person, as i am a beginner and have been using it myself merely for 2 years. But she wanted to feel how the questioning-answering process goes and I helped her out, coin-wise and interpretation-wise. I gave her my sincere opinion on her reading, letting through my intuition and talking freely because I felt she was comforted by it somehow...  But when she left I was scared that I abused the knowledge of the book and her trust in me, and that I might have lead her on mistakingly. So I thought I could double check the reading here and if anything very new and striking comes up from your opinions, I will let her know. So, her question: What will happen if I move to London to pursue the studies in dance-therapy?context: dance is her life and she doesnt imagine doing anything else. (how I understand that!). She always had the longing to unite that with her impulse to work with healing, and to build community. But her own career as a dancer always came first. Now that is gone and her planB is either move on to this education in a city she cant really afford (so far) and where she knows no one, or stay here and just teach classes, or as a remote chance join the commune I have also been working with, and retreat into the wilderness. None of the options seem to fully resonate with her at the moment. answer: 14 (3,6) >  54I told her that for me this meant she has a lot to offer at this moment, her dance skills and knowledge, together with the beautiful sensitive human being she is, is really a great treasure. It is promising to share her wisdom with others, and she could approach this experience with an attitude of someone who shares what she knows and not only piles up more knowing and makes a better CV. So overall London seems like a promising way to go, but I also intuited some frustration (54) as in being somehow out-shined or second-choice, not at her full potential. Or in other words, she has to accept she is not anymore the star of the company, as she has been so far. Line 3 made me also think that she can genuinely have high aspirations in this healing thing, to help others and contribute to a larger context, but perhaps some structures in her are still too attached to having a career and being always the best (as I always knew her to be). We talked a bit about this and her motivations to go to london... Ok, she left pretty confused and I was left thinking I was out of line. At some point I was really talking like someone who really understands and can speak on behalf of the I Ching - and nothing could be further away from the truth.... I think I can still make amends and call her back, what do you suggest I could add to my previous reading in order to help this decision of hers?Thank you so much, yoana :bows:"
694,"Hi its Hebe and the time felt right to get some futher clarity on what to do next.  Both my husband and I are feeling the constraints of the job knowing that we will be leaving at some stage before April, but in a way 'killing time'.  I wanted to know if it would be the right thing to do to just focus on the qualities of the next job that I needed although not knowing what or where.  I asked the I Ching ' How will things evolve if I just focus on following my nose and leads for when we leave?' and when I got hexagram 5 I was pleased as this was so true with what I was feeling - to just wait patiently, but the crunch came when I looked at my moving line which was 4, which definitely gave me the thought that truly it wasn't a good idea to 'just wait' and follow my nose with leads at all.  I guess the cave could also be referring to my mindset and not literally 'get out' of the job.  That is also worth considering.I pursued this with asking - 'what will be the outcome of aiming to leave as soon as possible?' (even though to an extent this is out of my hands) and was given 27 unchanging, which looked and felt pretty good.    However, then fear kicked in , as I truly haven't found anything in terms of where to go next or what to do.  I posed this question finally in a kind of conversational manner: ' ok, I'm with you, and is it ok to not have a plan? because I don't as yet and I don't want to drift'... and the resulting hexagram was 14.I get the impression that its not normal to put a few questions onto this forum, but they led into each other so easily that I felt it was ok to ask the series.How I will follow this all up I'm not sure.  Our employers come back from the states on thursday and are beginning the interiewing process for our replacements - no doubt we'll talk and I can suggest that we are up for leaving as soon as possible and not necessarily April if itworks out for them.  It does put me in a bit of a flurry though as apart from following my gut with leads there doesn't seem to be anything concrete that I can rely on to help me with this transition.  What do you think?  Hexagram 27 and 14 both seem very encouraging in terms of reassurance.  Any help with this would be appreciated very much, Hebe"

I asked the ICHING if there would/could be a possible romance between us.I received Hex 35 - Progressthis was on BOTH SIDES of Hilarys translations, no red lines (changing lines).  I am interpreting this as ""Maybe""???  we are well together, as we are also learning partners in our training class.  the fact that he is from the same town, grew up in one of my favorite places in Brooklyn and shares many past feelings about our places of interests, is a joy to me.  i can't wait to get to work every day and see him.He had asked me if i had a boyfriend or if was engaged, I said no, and i asked him about his situation, he is not with his girlfreind anymore. We were just talking, about stuff, and that was when he asked about my situation.  I am playing it very cool.  This is something that i was just so curious about,  i really do not want to have an Office Romance - especially now with all the learning i am doing in my new job.  But it is so refreshing for me, to be able to talk to some handsome guy who actually RESPONDS BACK TO ME IN KIND and looks for me in the morning to start the day...LOLOLalso, the fact that HE ACTUALLY LIVES IN TOWN IS NICE ALSO!!!!HOW CON-VE-NIE-NT!!!!!!!!!!  LOLPlease, let me know if this HEX is indeed telling me that this could be a possibility....i take the Progress as Taking It Slow??

704,"hi everybody,have been without a relationship for quite a long time, changing place where I lived, buinding up my social life, realizing many other things in my life, changing, understanding and getting aware of many otehr things, but always without a partner.am quite at ease in my skin, and quite engaged, my life can be defined ""full"" and anything but mediocre, but now I got to a point where I am longing for love in my life.I asked about the purpose of this period to IC and got 48.3 > 29?9 at 3: The well is seeping, no drinking. It makes my heart ache. One might draw from it. The king is bright, together we receive its blessing. If something does not work, then look at it from all sides, think about it, direct your attention to it. Solutions need fostering, they are not simply there or not. Even if you cannot figure out anything, if it has your attention, then out of nowhere some idea will come.and the description of 29 I found is simply very beautiful, as I am working on my fears...and have been a master in hyper protecting myself...  ""To get out of dangers or misery is not by solving problems. It is by leaving the fear. In the arts of fighting one learns to get used to danger, so it does not call up fear anymore, and defense can come entirely out of one's skill. No fear interfering.    Then one can be like water, adapting, fitting into any form. Water in a cup acquires the form of the cup, in a lake the form of the lake. It is smooth and flowing - and can be terribly crushing.     Deep inside one has a stable, quiet and safe core, but in the course of life, most people forget about it. Just remember and no danger can afflict you. Visit the dark secret depths of your heart and bring the wisdom of your soul back to life""Any additional insight will be greatly appreciated!lovely weekend,lindorita"""
705,"Hello, I am very pleased to find this website! This is my first post.I have been consulting the I Ching via a phone app for about 6 months. The results have amazed me, it's such a clever book.Last night I had the audacity to ask quite a vain question. For years I've been 20 pounds heavier than I'd like. Having tried and failed with various weight loss techniques, I asked ""how can I work towards the body that I want?""How appropriate to get 27, Corners Of The Mouth! I love its ""Cheeks"" imagery. And to have 35, Progress, in my future is very encouraging.I feel the reading tells me to stop any vain comparisons of my physical self with that of others, and to focus instead on proper nutrition and health. I also want to be fit for my small children - this is a more noble aim and focus. In the changing lines, I love the image of the tiger staring, watching my progress- I am going to find a picture of a tiger and stick it to my fridge door for those times when the cheese and ice-cream call me!Can anyone help me with changing line 1 though, the magic tortoise that has got away from me? I see it as a reference to my current lazy eating habits, but feel it has more to tell me.Thanks for reading and for any tortoise ideas!"

709,"Hello everyone,After some recent forays into the frightening world of astrology, I'm returning here to confirm some of what I've heard in that other realm.I have had, by all measures, quite a difficult 2010 to date. I am looking forward to the end of this year, which in many ways feels like the end of my life as I have known it. I finished some very big growth cycles (big plus) and achieved a great deal career wise. But as usual, the most important and sought after area of my life -- love-- eludes me. I had my heart torn to shreds this spring. I am almost all healed from it. Part of the healing process has been trying to meet other people to get my mind off of the other person and also to try to remind myself good people exist. Except I haven't found any of the good people -- I just keep hitting brick wall and my discouragement has risen considerably. To top it off, my younger sister is married and just had a child. I am doubtful if i will ever be able to have a child given my already advanced age; at this point, i'd be thrilled to find a man i love and who loves me in return> even THAT seems impossible. For everyone else these things fall into place. Love for me is the most unreachable element of my life; and the fact that it is that way hurts me very deeply.I asked the Yi several questions just now as a result.  Have I already met my future husband? 46.1 Pushing Upward>11 Flow.Why am I still alone? 9.1. 6 Taming Power of Small>48 the WellFor 46.1>11, I cannot tell if this is a ""yes"" or not. Pushing upward and the single line are positive proclamations but maybe not ""clear affirmatives"". I do get that it is saying that i have to go with the flow. Fine - but I am curious if i already know who my future husband is (ie is he in my circle of friends/acquaintances). Partly bc I have cared deeply for one man, who is a colleague and long time friend, and he recently broke up with his 10-yr relationship. I have heard he's dating someone else but i dont know if it is serious and I thought, for a moment, we might have a chance. We're not in touch frequently however.For the second reading, 9.1.6: ""The first line, undivided, shows its subject returning and pursuing his own course. What mistake should he fall into? There will be good fortune."" - I take this to mean ""dont force it and things will be OK."" (Ugh, sooo not helpful). I'm not forcing anything. I'm just tired of waiting. I put out no effort and nothing happens. I put out some effort -- and nothing happens.Line 6: """" the rain has fallen, progress is stayed; so must we value the full accumulation of the virtue represented by the upper trigram. But a wife exercising restraint, however firm and correct she may be, is in a position of peril, and like the moon approaching to the full. If the superior man prosecute his measures in such circumstances, there will be evil."" In another site, a summary of this line: ""one must be content with what has already been attained.""ie. ENJOY your continued life of solitude.Any input, as always, is greatly appreciated."
710,"Hello dear Yi friends,there is a legal review currently going on at the company I work for, and I have been required to provide documents and be interrogated. I am concerned about the potential risks inherent in this situation, so I have asked what I can do to minimise them. I got 37.5,6 > 36. I must admit at first sight I find this response quite alarming. I clearly understand the concept of ""family"" in reference to the company, with the consequent reminders to be honest and trustful in my support to the review. It's hex 36 which is scaring me... Can you please help me better understand it?Thanks in advance!Cris"
711,"After being inspired by another thread I decided to give it a go and asked the Yi:What is there to know about a romantic love coming into my life?Received 19.6 > 41.Don't know what to make of it... both the primary hex and the changing line appear auspicious, but Decrease does not sound too promising... unless it's a reflex of my current state of mind.Any insight will be highly appreciated!

712,"Hello, dear Clarity members The return from Summer holidays inspired a broad (in retrospect, somewhat vague) reading:""Dear Yi, please tell me what the best way is to make my life happy.""47.3 > 28Gulp. Oppression / Exhaustion. A very ominous changing line too, according to all the texts I consulted:A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,And leans on thorns and thistles.He enters the house and does not see his wife.Misfortune.Self-inflicted oppression? Inability to see the good around me? Maybe. Imbalance? Afraid so. Renounce? Truly hope not... I found an interesting insight to the same casting in another reading:trojan said:I think your answer may be saying you are giving yourself too hard a time, stop doing this   line 3 says you are hurting yourself looking for things to nourish and support you where they cannot.   Or maybe you are giving yourself a hard time because you feel you messed up the situation and now you're getting wound up over it.  I think the Yi is just telling you to stop hurting yourself.  (...) I think you would do better to take care of yourself a bit now and chill  these feelings are getting too much (28)Click to expand...Close to home. It would not be the first time the Yi warns me against my inclination to bash myself... This however sounds like the optimistic interpretation  According to the pessimistic one the IC is just saying: forget about happiness...Quite worried about this answer, I decided to ask again:""Dear Yi, what is there to know to clarify your previous response about making my life happy?""46.0Pushing upward? Well, the judgement says ""Fear not""... that's reassuring at least! Maybe the Yi is suggesting to set myself to work to create my own opportunities to be happy? Any help will be much appreciated."
713,"My question was: Show me (financial/career) if I make my transition out of insurance and open the door wide for a new opportunity .. what can I expect?What I believe this is telling me is: yes, now is the time to make this move ... things are lined up in my favor today to take this step(s).

714,"Hello everyone i am new to this site, and i need some insight on a question i asked the iching, i got hexegram 19. I am currently involved with a much older man whom i have deep feelings for, he is very successful and is already in a relationship with another woman. he has lived very far away from me but we talk a couple times a week sometimes more often, have spent time in person about 3 times, and have always had great chemistry, obviously this man is in a relationship, but heres the catch, hes moving very close to me in a month and wants to see me. i asked the iching, what would become of me and him once he moved close to me and i got 19 as a result. I would love it if someone could break it down for me in the best way they can so i can better understand where me and him stand and where this is going, i am willing to accept the truth but this seems to be a rather auspicious hexegram so maybe theres hope? i dont know im not trying to step on this girls toes or cause any type of pain to anyone, but i would like to know your guy's opinions on the matter, thankyou!"

716,"Hi, all.  With a recent reading the question was asked What will you tell me about the future of my drawing (as in art)?  The IC gave 4.6 changing to 7.  After doing some research (a lot of it through older threads on this site), I feel comfortable in saying that the IC is saying that getting a tutor or taking an art class is what is best to do. I believe on one old thread about hex 4 Willowfox said something to the effect that 4.6 is about punishing the fool through instruction.  Well, I don't think that this is a case that calls for punishment, but I do know that another word for punishment is discipline, and I know that discipline can be about training/honing a skill. It seems the IC is saying that the beginner needs to be disciplined through instruction.Well, I feel I've made a valid interpretation of this reading.  If someone feels otherwise then please do say so.  I know I'm definitely not an expert on the IC."
717,"…at the last possible moment!I was very, very lucky that Ravi Walsh agreed to step in at the last minute after one of the Festival of Change speakers had to drop out. He’s a spiritual life coach who works with a method of his own creation – or maybe it would be better to call it a method of his own discovery, as it sounds as though it rather created itself – called Symbolic Tracking. You can read about that here – and you’ll see why he’s a good fit for a Festival celebrating living in the flow of change, and all our ways of connecting with it.Ravi was delighted when I told him we have 90 minutes for his call, as that means there’s time for him to share the whole process he uses with his clients. Though we’ve only had time to talk once, I get the distinct impression of someone who’s itching to give as much as possible……which makes sense considering that Yi describes the gift he offers as Great Possession in Small Taming – 14.4.5 changing to 9.I actually get the feeling this reading’s talking both about Ravi and what he gives, and also what role there is for me to play to allow him to give it. I’ll be the ‘small farmer’ for this call, the one who takes care of the terrain and makes it ready. I think I can probably also expect to experience some of the ‘not quite there yet’ frustration of Small Taming, running round managing the technical things rather than being able to settle into the call and get the full benefit of it. (I hope I’m wrong – but I’ll have the recording to listen to again and again when I’m not under pressure, and that will be good.)Also, line 4 leaps out at me -‘It is not for you to dominate,No mistake.’This is the line about beating your war drum, trying to get the world to march to your rhythm. I’ve found the ‘no mistake’ in this line is often responding to a certain fear that if you’re not controlling things, they’re really not being done properly. Well… most of the calls will be in an ‘interview’ format, more or less; Ravi will be shaping his call as he goes along. And yes, I’m so new to the way he works that some part of me does want to take back control. This line is certainly talking to me.Come to think of it, though, this is also talking about Ravi. His work is absolutely not about what he says anyone should be doing, following, experiencing etc… it’s entirely guided by the rhythm set by the individual’s experience.Line 5 I do think is Ravi’s:‘His truth interacts, strikes awe -Good fortune.’This is a gift that connects with Hexagram 1, Creative Force. (Interestingly, the same line came up in a reading I did for – and about – James Warlock, that I’ve yet to share on the blog.) It’s hugely full of energy and has the potential to be a little overwhelming (something I can relate to after talking with Ravi). Here’s what I wrote about this line in the book, trying to capture that uncompromising purity of Hexagram 1:Pure, undiminished truth communicates directly and with great force. It is not compromised by trying to convey a specific message or create a particular outcome, but speaks consistently and powerfully through what it is.You will make the most profound and lasting difference simply by being who you are, without dilution and without ulterior motives.​The Festival begins tomorrow, Saturday, at 3pm UK time. There is still time to join! (It doesn’t matter if you miss a call or two, as they’re all being recorded.)"
718,"I had a fight with my guy, it was my fault but it was actually a pretty minor thing in my opinion and I have apologized. The apology was not accepted and he refuses to speak with me and I am baffled. Baffled, because I don't understand why it is such a big deal. I basically accused him of cheating, which he denied. There were some angry words thrown out and I was crying but I also told him I love him and don't want to lose him. Which is apparently what I've gone and done. I don't understand why he feels this is serious enough to end things so I asked,""why is it he is still so angry with me""  and the answer was 61.5-->41this line has always represented love in my past readings so I am not sure why it came up in this context unless I read it as he is upset that I told him I love him and don't want to lose him so he freaked out and decreased me (41)??for confirmation I asked ""Is the reason he was so upset due to the fact that I told him Ilove him?"" and received 30.5-->13 ouch, I guess this represents me crying and gaining a sudden moment of clarity in thought that this is in fact the reason he has walked Is this pretty much how I should be reading this?  I know at the end of the day these readings are pointless in the grand scheme of things (he's gone), but trying to tell my heart that it doesn't need to know WHY is not that easy"
719,"Hello,this is my first post so forgive me for not introducing myself and jumping straight in. The reason I am posting is this, and I assume its a common one that brings many people here, is love. I was with my ex for a couple of years. We broke up because I was afraid to commit. I will leave out the detail of that as I feel that is the essence of the matter. I beliv this caused her great pain and much self-defence mechanism. We have remained in contact but it has been fraught. She says she wants to keep our friendship despite the difficulty. These difficulties have come from me admitting to her that I still want her and love her. Now, as it stands, she is about to start dating again. Prior to knowing this I decided that as I had only ever made my confession online I would make it face-to-face, hoping that the voice and the eyes would aid her in seeing my truth. I consulted the i-ching on this matter, asking for an indication of what I should expect if I follow through with this plan, and received Hexagram 31. I took this to be a sign of encouragement, as an endorsement of my feeling that I cannot deny my true desires any longer. I come here to those more experienced in interpretation to ask for guidance on the task. Any and all assistance is gratefully received. Thank you."

722,"Hi,I was married for 18 years and my relationship broke up in January 2009.

His mother passed over 12 years ago but came back in spirit and apologised about 5 years ago.

723,"Yesterday, before I went to sleep I was agonizing over a situation I was in with this girl named Sue. Here's what I wrote down:I don't feel like being a nice guy anymore. I don't want anything. I thought maybe a relationship with Sue could've been interesting, because in a weird sort of way, she's a lot like me. Anyways, I can't do much. I'm not even sure she likes me anymore.The reading: 42.2 > 61Then, I woke up this morning and remembered the reading. I enquired the I Ching again with the following:I like Sue. It's weird but I really want this girl to like me.The reading: 42.1.2.5 > 4OK, I know what the I Ching is trying to tell me but I'm amazed at how I get the same hexagram over two consecutive readings, albeit 8 hours apart.----------Here's the story (because let's face it, everyone loves details):Sue and I have met each other almost a year ago and we became good friends over a relatively short period of time, having found common interests and such, we really hit it off after an initial feeling out period. So around April, I started seriously exploring the possibility of a relationship with her (see Courting Sue Part 1). The Yi basically advised me to keep it on the low for a bit and to let things emerge by themselves. I followed that advice and SHAZAM! We just... happened.Well, what would you know, we ended up being more than just friends. We got close, closer and then we got intimate.  For about two months, things were up and down but we both couldn't deny our mutual affection and growing feelings for each other. Then, circumstances beyond our control seemed to emerge from out of everywhere and we got into a bit of tension (see Courting Sue Part 2). Here again, the Yi made me feel optimistic. So as the weeks went by, I didn't lose hope but I also did not dwell on the situation. Alas, trusting in the genuine connection that we had, the Yi was right once again. We patched things up, but here's the catch: sadly, our little relationship 'experiment' seems to have come to an end. It was a decision on her part and I've been very tactful and respectful in the whole process. The only thing is, I know that she knows that I still have feelings for her. The zinger is that she also knows that I know that she still has feelings for me. For whatever reasons, she doesn't feel like taking the next step but has openly told me that she really needs me to be a friend. Well, what is a friend to do? How could I say no to that?But over the course of the past two weeks, it's been getting harder for me to keep my feelings in check, to the point where I am openly avoiding to meet or even call her over the phone. I know this same feeling that made us close is also tearing me from the inside out, so much that I do not know how to act with her anymore which is the source of even more tension between us. This is where my two I Ching readings come from.Thanks for reading. I'm just so relieved I let this all out.Cheers!BARRY"

I do not know what to make of it.It looks like a no, but at the same time I read a post from Hilary saying that it could mean that he will be able to bite through opposition easily (tender flesh), kind of eaven losing himself (his nose) into it ... so i'm dubious.

728,"Howdy dear Yi friends!In the past few months I have been exercising regularly, getting fitter and feeeling better. This has however taken its toll on me in terms of time and energy, and is becoming more and more like an umpteenth heavy duty rather than an enjoyable activity. Furthermore, the program I've been following will definitely not give me the results I'm after, so I need to find an alternative to increase both effectiveness and pleasure.I asked:""Dear Yi, please, enlighten me on how to improve my physical shape"".R.: 43.3 > 58Breakthrough, alternating to the Joyous. Exactly what I'm looking for... if it wasn't for the changing line which sounds slightly ominous.To be powerful in the cheekbonesBrings misfortune.The superior man is firmly resolved.He walks alone and is caught in the rain.He is bespattered,And people murmur against him.No blame.I found this interesting commentary (N. Richmond):""... here there is this power of self-will which is misfortunate in this context because no amount of it can be effective and it produces stress with no flow for its relief. The wide-seeing superior man is just going about his business, not trying to push things, and this is correct in our present circumstances"".It sounds like a suggestion not to push my self-developed program too far. The line also talks about a lonely resolution - an interesting hint to the current exercise which I do on my own. Is the Yi suggesting to keep it up, or to find a more social physical activity (joining with friends for practice, as indicated by Hex 58)?I'll be grateful for any insight Last edited: Sep 1, 2010"

Hex 1 would appear to suggest a forceful action, however its alternating to Small Taming indicates the need for some caution. Would love to hear your takes :bows:"
731,Can I achieve the look I want?  I-Ching casted Hexagram 60.5.6 to Hexagram 41.I interpreted this as restraint and if I persist in attempting to achieve the physical look that I want that I will fail?  Or that there will be a lot of difficulty in my attempt to achieve the look I want.

I am able to keep the main business, that means all the benefits but also all debtsHe wants me to take over the lease of the office which is a big overheadAll i can say there allot of pros & cons probably more pros really but stillI am disapointed that I will miss out on the software opportunity however I could go to another state and do it at later dateI asked about this a while ago and the Yi predicted I would be virtually alone in this business.I just asked what should I do now and recieved 5.4.5>34I took this as  line 4  there is not much you can do at the moment which is dead right as this was his decision and line 5 as try to stay cheerful and dont lose sight of the big picture.There are allot of other questions I would like to ask Would appreciate any insight:bows:Steve"
733,"I've ambled around this morning until my questioning has led me back here for clarification - again.   The question is with regard to goal setting ""what is a worthy goal for me to set for myself with regard to this relationship with Dave?""Having started out with Standstill - 12 and reading old posts, I went on to question what problem I'm still not facing squarely (in myself) and that I have to address this in a different way.  I hear and read that I am too focused on ""him"" and I need to find outside interests and physically exercise and then ""be still"" but that I still have no idea where this is going or where I want it to go. No goal.I get that I'm not seeing this in the right way, that if I change the way I look at this, my anxiety can be put to rest.  I also get that what he and I have not talked about - at all - is that his relationship exists on a level we aren't allowed to tamper with.  61.5 Nice karma I've never discussed what I believe in with Dave.  He says things that make me think he believes in wizardry & magic but I know he was raised Catholic and does not practice that faith as an adult.  Politically, we're extreme opposites - I am liberal and he's ultra-conservative (American politics).  The I Ching is an important part of my daily practice and has been for many years.  I don't often discuss this with *anyone*!  Stumble ..... I just tripped over my resistance problem right here:  in an old archived post I read where I may be satisfied with the distance in our relationship because to really become intimate with someone, I'd be called upon to share what I believe and how I believe in it  ....  with someone who has failed in several respects so far, to value what I think.  And People, what I think is the only thing keeping me in this relationship, right?So, where I need advice .... help me to look at this differently.  I'm afraid to tell people what I think because I'd rather not argue .... not true .... I like to argue .... I don't want to look ridiculous .... feel ridiculed for what I believe .... Oh Lord ... I want to be right?  Groan!   I do not want to be a leader.  I want a partner who walks with me - evenly - and does not expect me to follow paths that go nowhere.  I have to figure out how to talk about this without coming across as a FLAKE!  Is that a worthy goal? :bows:"

I am looking forward to find fullfilment through what I do, having discovered my true nature and learning to letting it come out without fear,  and  I long for true love, as I do not feel like I wish anything which differs from that What does it suggest from your points of view? ..guess it says most of all that I have to get more detached towards emotional situations...which I am having some hard times in managing.and much much more...leave it open to your comments!Thank you all!lindorita"

Line 4 talks about hesitation, agitation, and the need to find determination (""auspicious"").

739,Long story cut short.  Been having an online relationship with a guy for nearly 3 years. We do talk on the phone as well. He is not constant but when we do talk everything is so perfect.Asked will he visit me this year.Got back Hex 17 unchanging. I am takingthis as positive and yes. Am I just being optimistic here?  Am new so not sure and don't want to get my hopes up.Any help appreciated.
740,"Given that the man I really like and am interested in currently lives in a different state and although he is staying in touch I asked Yi ""What type of relationship does X want from me?"" In reply, I got 9.1.2.5.6>15.  The way I interpreted it is he is also interested but because of the long distance X has retreated and is content with how things are right now while staying in touch.  Please advice if you see any further insight in this reading.  Thank you for helping me out."
741,"I asked the Yi what would happen if I ended my relationship and received a #3.1.2.4 > 47 reading. I get a little confused as to whether this mostly refers to how it is now or how it would be after we end it, if we do. The growing aspect of #3 seems contradictory to the constricting/exhausting aspect of 47. Should I consider the moving lines more than the relating hexagram? Does this mean the relationship is exhausting or I will be if I end it? Please help be understand this better as it's a major decision in my life now and there are no huge issues that make it clear to me within the relationship. It's just been something I've been struggling with internally for some time now. More lifestyle differences, timing stuff than anything. I live with her and her 13 yr old son, we would probably remain friends afterward. That's why its so hard for me to understand the inner workings of whats going on. I appreciate all insight into this.Thank you"
742,"I have a girlfriend who has been wondering about a possible partnership and finally, after much soul searching and meeting his relatives has decided this group is just too weird. Her problem now is how to extricate herself. She consulted the I Ching and got 36. Darkening of the Light, unchanging. Seemed like it was advising her to just move on without great fanfare. What interested me was I notice that 37. Family follows Darkening of the Light. I see this as meaning if you're gonna get through something you gotta keep your own light dim or tightly focused, don't show a lot of interest in the place you're trying to pass through, keep moving. Otherwise, if you spread your light, if you take more of an interest in the people around you, it will be harder to leave as you'll become part of 37.The Family.rosada"

749,"Hi all,I cast these readings two weeks ago, though much has happened since. I've been looking to buy a house for a couple years now-- dealing with finances and searching for the right place in my price range... Recently, I found such a house, so I asked the IC...general advice (should I make an offer? do I have a shot at getting it?) 23.5>20Would it be good investment and a happy home for the long-term future? 11.2 > 36 Since then I pulled together financing for the loan (with some help from my family) and made an offer which came in second place out of seven. So I'm in ""back up"" position, waiting on the other buyer's decision. I asked about my chances at this point and got 36.4.6 > 30. I took that as a no, though maybe it related to other events.  Yesterday, my current landlord gave me news that he needs to move back into my rental and I need to be out in two months. So now I'm more than desperate about buying this house!!! And a friend died tragically last week so I'm feeling fried emotionally. There's just a lot coming all at once.Any interpretations of these readings? I've asked the usual repetitive questions, but know that the first few casts are the ones that matter. I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but any advice would be appreciated.Thanks :bows:"

751,"In the Festival of Change, Claire Hayes will be helping with the integrating phase of a reading. You know… the moment when you understand what it’s saying to you, and the only minor detail left to deal with is actually changing in response. Occasionally this is easy – as simple as buy A, not B – and more often than not it really isn’t. Very often, I find myself saying apologetically to a client that yes, I get the easy job, providing a nice, clear interpretation. Then they’re left with the task of gathering resolution to act, or taking the risk of contacting someone, or letting an emotional attachment go… and this is not easy.This is where EFT – Emotional Freedom Technique – can help. And when I started asking round to see if there was an EFT expert who would be willing to join us and teach us how to use the method to help get readings through into reality, I was naturally pretty chuffed when the person who volunteered had the domain name EFT4change.I don’t have a share-able reading with Claire, but you can get a good sense of her ‘voice’ from this article, ‘All is Change’, and from her excellent free ‘pocket EFT’ series – all good, immediately-useful stuff.http://eft4change.blogspot.com/2010/08/all-is-change.htmlI asked Yi what gift Claire brings, and received Hexagram 55, Abundance, changing at lines 2, 3 and 4 to 19, Nearing. This one is taking a little more thinking about than previous ‘gift’ readings, but I think I’m starting to get it…Hexagram 55 describes that moment when you’ve received the sign – the eclipse at noon making the Dipper visible, the oracle that tells you not to hide away in the mourning hut but to make your offerings and march out… – and now you have to decide and act. There’s pressure, there’s perfect darkness, and there’s the imperative to be the king and take on responsibility.Abundance Nearing… this means partly that it’s a growing presence, I think, and partly that you’re growing in strength and presence yourself, which is certainly an aspect of 55. (It’s ‘the Nearing-experience of Abundance’.) 19 tends to mean becoming the responsible adult, the one with the overview, who is most definitely not a victim. In this case I get the feeling that it points to personal strength ‘nearing’, rising within you as a kind of inner ally and approaching the challenges of 55.(I think there’s a lot more to be understood about 19 here, though… not least since it’s also the relating hexagram in the reading about Tori Janaya’s gift.)So Claire comes in at just this moment of ‘easier said than done’ as you understand what you’re called on to do. Then the moving lines…‘Feng is screened off.At midday, seeing the Dipper.Going on gains doubts and anxieties.With truth and confidence coming to expression,Good fortune.’‘Feng is flooded with darknessAt midday, seeing a froth of light.Your right arm broken,Not a mistake.’‘Feng is screened offAt midday, seeing the Dipper.Meeting your hidden lord,Good fortune.’These lines actually make a lot of intuitive sense to me because I’ve already had an EFT session with Claire. There was the experience of encountering anxieties about going on, confusion and helplessness to act – things which I’d normally shove very firmly under the rug – and accepting them all. (Yi says ‘no mistake’; EFT says ‘I love and accept myself completely’.) And from there, allowing truth to come to expression, and even meeting the mysterious hidden lord who somehow becomes an ally.I’ve yet to read a sensible explanation of how EFT works, but I do have this experience of what was threatening, or concealed, or both, somehow turning into an ally and source of strength. It’s not entirely describable, but I would definitely recommend you join the Festival and experience it. Tomorrow (Saturday 28th) is the final day for the ‘early bird’ reduced price."
752,"I had a weird dream of a girl who I was friends with.  Everything was black around her (the background), but she was as usual and had a huge grin on her face.  But it was almost bad. It felt like I was viewing things from a different perspective - looked as if she had been manipulated by someone or something...I asked I-ching: What was the significance of my dream this morning?Hex 54.1 to Hex 40.  I concluded that the friendship I have with her will be no longer.  Almost like she was with someone in the dream, but the situation was not good even though she was smiling.  Then I asked: Is anything I could do to change her situation for the better?I got Hexagram 18.4 changing to Hexagram 50. I took this as don't do anything because changing anything would be a mistake?? Confused."

Now i asked to IC when i'll be emotionally better about this, and the answer 53,5 talking about 3years scared me. do u think that is going to take 3years(actually,our unproductive relation was 3 years long!!i lost my opportunity and i know that is going to be hard to learn about this experience,but is the only way to don't destroy another relation again)        John Blofeld is his book is telling that this line corresponds with the 5th week of january and hex 52 corresponde with 3months period(Februar,March,April).Instead,other info is talking about hex 52 like a cicle that goes August to August(405days)     The other option is just that IC is telling me to go on, no be worried about future because will be success,and i'll be calm(or maybe the success arrive when i'll be calm,hard job!)    what do u think about?  :bows::bows:"

756,"Hi to you all!wrong final hex...its 20!currently studying to get a new profession, very commitedd, and loving it, its so ressourceful.

757,"To follow up on my previous inquires  and responses regarding continuing education in my field or leaving it altogether, I decided to ask ""what would happen if I began to see clients from home?I think that perhaps changing from an employee to seeing more private clients at home may be the change I need to help me get back ( nuclear hex. 24-Returning) to the kind of practice I envisioned when I began. It all seems a go as far as I can tell. The #10 relating hexagram makes sense as far as not upsetting my employer by blatantly taking clients away and withdrawing appropriately. What would so many moving lines stacked up in the top hex. imply? Any and all advice welcome."
758,"Every time I mentioned some new aspect of the Festival of Change to a certain friend and mentoring client, she’d tell me I really needed to talk to James about that. Looking at his various websites, I could see what she meant – lots of breadth there, signs of a wholesome, down-to-earth attitude and a willingness to call things ‘utter twaddle’ – and went to talk with Yi.(I did this for all the people I considered asking as speakers, probably more asking about other people than I’ve ever done before. But in the context it made sense: there wasn’t any other practical way to get the understanding I needed, and I couldn’t imagine initiating a partnership like this without asking Yi’s take on it first. I just leant on readings rather more for this than I usually would. The resultant readings were, without exception, very revealing and helpful. They also relate to one another in some fascinating ways…)What gift would James bring people?Hexagram 26, Great Taming, changing at line 3 to 41, Decrease/Offering. (That is, changing to the primary hexagram in the reading about Tori Janaya.)Greatly accumulating with and through Decrease, purposefully cultivating mastery by making simple offerings… and with that idea, from 26, of accumulating skills and energy with a view to going further, ‘not eating at home’, being of greater service -‘Great taming,Constancy bears fruit.Not eating at home, good fortune.Fruitful to cross the great river.’Whatever mastery is to be had on this scale, it always contains the hidden possibility (nuclear hexagram, 54) of being like the Marrying Maiden, who comes home into a new situation far beyond her scope/scale, and must grow into it. This isn’t going to be about ‘becoming intuitive’ as if that were an end in itself.‘Taming’ stands in for one of those Chinese characters that isn’t remotely adequately translated by any English word I can think of. Great Taming, Nurturing, Accumulating, Restraining… the idea is of containment and control as a kind of caring, one that allows for growth. Given the word’s roots in fields and farming, it makes sense to think of this as Great Self-Cultivation. This post at Living I Ching talks of 26 as restraint, study and practice. After talking with James about magical ritual as a spiritual practice, this strikes chords for me.Specifically, James brings a fine horse, and the means of training it:‘A fine horse for pursuit.Constancy in hardship bears fruit.Daily training, chariot driving, protecting.Fruitful to have a direction to go.’My first sense is that this is something we need: the training, the developed skills, to make full use of our intuition, our energy – whatever name you give to that inner capacity for moving fluently with Change. (It also dovetails intriguingly with the reading about Jen Louden and the ‘great chariot to carry loads’ – the chariot, and how to drive it!)Left untrained, the horse is very beautiful, strong and swift, and it runs with the herd. Here’s what I have in my book for this line:“Before you think about what you are pursuing, you need to concentrate on how you pursue it. The energy and spirit you have for this are of great potential value, like a fine horse. And you cannot have a horse without a duty of care – nor yet a fine, well-trained horse unless you accept the daily work (and discomfort, struggle and sacrifice) of training it. Through constancy, the work becomes the gift.The horse will follow its instincts and run with the herd. For your power to pursue to become a strength rather than a liability, these impulses must be restrained, boundaries safeguarded and energies redirected – so that you control the direction of travel.Having your chosen direction in mind gives you the motivation to train a fine horse. But what you are really mastering here is freedom of movement, so that it becomes meaningful to choose a direction to go.”​So having James speak at the beginning of the event, about Opening, seemed to make sense – and now I’ve talked with him and got an idea of his range of experience and the ‘layers’ of opening he can address, it makes copious amounts of sense. We’ll be talking about ways to open and clear space for a reading, and ways to do this in a way that invites in true intuition, and let you tell it apart from assorted other mental/ emotional furniture.This is going to be good – you should come!Meanwhile… any ideas for questions I should ask him?"
759,"I asked the Yi about possibilities for finding relief from longstanding financial dilemmas and received the reading:  Hex 29, changing lines two and five, becoming Hex 2.This is of course about ""chasms"" which doesn't sound very wonderful, except that the subject is floating downstream as i understand it, between sheer cliffs and looking for a place to climb out, so at least not drowned -- yet.  In line two, there isn't a level place to emerge, the cliffs are too high.  And so we meander a bit further and by changing line 5, conditions have changed a little bit and it looks possible that the querent has a chance to pull back from disaster before going over the crashing waterfalls further on and being crushed -- at least that the sort of mental image I have.And then we come out with Hex 2, where maybe consistency and perserverance keep things on an even keel into the longer term.  Seems realtively positive on the surface of it -- although no promise of any rapid recovery as yet.  Thoughts anyone?"
760,"Finally had the big job interview for employment at a great distance in a foreign land; one with huge potential and responsibility.  I asked the Yi how I was perceived in this encounter with two male interviewers and cast:  Hex 34.4 becoming Hex 11.  Seems to me that it was positive, but is 34 generally a sign of being overbearing?  I felt in the interview that I was able to explain a lot of my qualifications but wasn't sure they are all applicable.  The interviewers were extremely intelligent people with enormous experience of their own so I felt that whatever their perception, they would be fair.The thought of taking on this position is daunting to me, but would provide a path to growth that I can only imagine.  Any thoughts?"
761,"In general I can be confused about moving lines that seems to express such conterary things...I just recently met a man to which I'am very attracked to and we just spend  a couple of days together. It felt good but also to was very new in the sence of getting to learn one another. We both end forty have had quit unusual lifestyles both Tiger in Chinese astrology. And than he is a cancersign like I'am ... So it could take a while before there is enough confidence to be able to express.The different lines express such different situation...Line 3 and 5 give a positive impression. Line 6 at the contrary is one could say awfull with fighting and blood in the meddow...And than it is 53 that is the following hex.

763,"Can someone please tell me their views on what it means to be seen by another person as hexagram 10 (unchanging). My question was about my boss - how does Boss see me - but the answer really wasn't what I'd have expected. This is important to me because he is a central, powerful figure and much will depend on him going forward. In the past, he has been incredibly supportive and I've really come to like him. I read as much as I could find about this hex and found out that it does relate to hierarchy and being within limits but, on the other hand, am not certain I like the exotic, clandestine appeal of tigers and such.  I am grateful for any observations, as ever."

Tori describes how come we can hear things and not get them: ‘how we can get stuck in the psychological game of acquiring fabulous insights that seem brand new and fresh, but they don’t result in us having really true, lasting transformation in our character.’ Or in other words, a game I’ve certainly played with readings in the past, and I’m reasonably sure I’m not the only one. What makes the difference is the quality of listening… and this is what Tori goes on to talk about. (In this audio it’s about communication with another human being rather than with an oracle, but the principle of listening is the same.) When I asked what gift Tori would bring as a participant in the Festival, Yi was quite specific: Hexagram 41, Decrease or Offering, changing at line 6 to 19, Nearing. Line 6 reads - ‘Not decreasing, increasing it. Not a mistake. Constancy, good fortune. Fruitful to have a direction to go. Gaining servants, not a home.’ - which reminds me of how Yi described other speakers’ gifts, too, as offering tools and vehicles, the means of travel, not the destination.  In Hexagram 19, a presence Nears benevolently: something to attend to and allow (and not to anticipate or hurry towards harvest, demanding results on your own schedule). 41.6 is the offering to this nearing presence – one that’s ultimately no sacrifice at all, doesn’t decrease but increases you, because it blesses you with*‘servants, not a home.’ That is – this is not an end in itself; it doesn’t offer you an objective or a place to settle down, but only the strength and help to travel in your chosen direction. To be able to listen fully is a gift for the road."
765,"Hi guysI am in a job that i don't really enjoy. More than half the time, my heart is elsewhere. I am completely unmotivated, unless there is a dateline to meet. But i stay on because the pay is good, and it is familiar (like an old habit i suppose) to a certain extent, and trying something else just seems scary. Events have transpired and now i have to make a decision whether i want to stay or leave.My readings were:What if I leave?58.2.3 > 8What if I stay and be motivated?12.4 > 20Leaving seems like a 'joyous' decision as hex 58 suggests. And 8 seems like a nice hexagram too. But the line in hex 12.4 sounds good as well. As if it would be correct as a mandate has been passed upon it. What do you guys think?"
766,"I saw my doctor on Friday to renew the Rx for my anti-depressant medication which I've been on nearly a year now.  In the course of her physical exam she noted that I've lost 38 pounds in the last year (which is GOOD!), my cholesterol is now normal and all the tests came back good so I have improved greatly from my former fibromyalgia daze.  We talked about my personal issues for a bit and those issues are improving as well. She suggested that with my much more physically fit body that I look for an activity (I have a lot of time on my hands) that would help me to feel less lonely, hence less depressed.   So today I asked the Yi  ""what kind of activity should I involve myself in that will lift my depression.Again I'm paraphrasing Cleary:29.  Mastering Pitfalls.  Pitfalls mean danger.   Mastering pitfalls means getting through danger - going from one danger to another yet able to get through successfully in spite of danger.  Restoring yang within yin  - if one practices good one becomes good - a matter of how people habitually act .....W/B:  In the heart the divine nature is locked within the natural inclinations and tendencies, and is thus in danger of being engulfed by desires and passions....  the way to overcome danger is to hold firmly to one's disposition to do good....29.5 ‘The chasm does not overflow,Here it already finds its level – no mistake.’  One does not see evil in common people but also being able to be unmoved and unaffected, one is vastly different from ordinary people - not self-satisfied inwardly, yet not pursuing externals - this is stability of superior wisdom being spontaneously good without training.  W/B:  Water flows on and nowhere piles up. Hex 7:  Discipline  Crowds  - an enemy invasion - there is danger of misfortuneSo, I get think good thoughts, do good deeds, and repel an enemy invasion - go with the flow -  but I have not a clue what kind of ""activity"" this points to.  I was thinking more along the lines of an exercise class but this seems to be pointing me to a more ""social"" involvement.  Clues for the clueless, please :bag:"
767,"I've been seeing this lady for some time now and we have had a strange experience.  I have so much in common with this women that its strange.  We have a very strong spiritual connection and as ive said have lots in common.  When I met her she was having some health issues and I saw a side of her that i didnt like so I backed away.  She had surgery, made a few life changes and now shes back.  Since we've begun talking again i find myself very attracted to her based on our common interest.  I asked the question where is this relationship going from here and got 44 L 2 and  L6 changing to 31.  This is confusing to me as 44 says stay away but 31 says to form a union.   I also asked how does she feel about taking this relationship to the next level and got 41 L1 and L3 chaning to 18.  Any clairification would be helpfullLast edited: Aug 25, 2010"
768,"I got 60.1.5 > 7I am trying to dedicate some time to those less fortunate and am puzzled by this response. Anyone can help me? It mentions a courtyard outside my door in line 1: ""Not going out of the door and courtyard is no error."" Does this mean I have to venture further from where I live in London/ Paris? And what kind of work is represented by no. 60? Sounds a bit like a closed institution but I am just guessing here. I also asked 'What sorts of people should I help?' and got 46.2.5 > 39. Sounds like children, no? I'd appreciate your thoughts, as I really want to start volunteering."

772,"13.6 is challenging the way we look at relationships. People in the ""countryside"" appear all the same outwardly but inwardly they are not. To accept this in close relationships is very difficult since we want to be inwardly close as well. I got this line when asking about exactly this to someone I am very close outwardly for 18 years but feel inwardly quite incompatible for a long time, hence not enough intimacy to feel really content. Unfortunately, this is not going away. So I get regularly frustrated and ask the IGing what the root cause of my frustration is and got 13.6. Should I be worried about this? The IGing says that I shouldn't - no regrets! I find this quite difficult to stomach. It also says that things are quite not yet as they should be! What does that mean? Well, the resulting 49 gives a hint - things need to change quite a bit! But where to and how? It seems that the IGing gives a good analysis of the socical circumstances but hasn't got the answer for this either! Does it mean that their are things in our love life we just have to accept? Acceptance of the ""normality"" of the power of convenience - is that the dramatic change? Is that all? Am I on my way to become normal? "
773,"Hi,I'm new to this and would like to ask for your interpretation of a reading I got about a potential love story with a much younger man: The first I Ching was #4, the second #38.My interpretation would be that it's got the potential of being a nice refreshing fling but I should not count on a long term relationship. What do you think?Many thanks in advance!"

775,"Help. First post here.Greetings,So I began doing readings last week and one of my questions was ""what if I devoted my time to writing now?"" I got 21 Eradicating or Biting Through, with moving lines at Initial 9 (#35) and 5th 6 (#25). I feel that if I do pursue more time to writing that I must work through quite a bit, ""gnaw through"" a tenacious obstacle. Any suggestions or advice about this. I then asked the I Ching what the obstacle was that I must bit through and got #22, Adornment or Grace with a moving line at 9 above (#36, brightness Hiding). I immediately thought that this may have to do with not worrying about appearances, how my writing would ""look"" to others and get to the truth of my own expression. Not to be afraid of letting others read or hear my writing. I've had a huge block with this, sitting down and doing the work. I want it all to look good before showing others so I usually just end up not doing it. Does any of this make sense or do any of you see it differently. Is this an auspicious activity to pursue for me?I am very excited about delving into the I Ching, although it can be overwhelming with all the different layers and modes of interpretation available. I am eager to spend more time with it.PeaceChrisLast edited: Aug 22, 2010"
776,"Hello there!I met this girl at work two month ago. There was quickly a strong affinity between us which I tried to ignore, as I just had find work after a long unemployed period. I am still homeless and I didn't want any more trouble... Until I realised I was hooked.But then she left to begin a formation, I just had time to phrase my appreciation of her and take her phone number. She never answered my calls, except once, she messaged me for coffee the following week, and no answer since. I have no idea of what's going on (three weeks since she left work) I just know I want to see her even if nothing would happen between us.So I asked IC: what to do to unblock this situation?47,5 - 40I think 47 quite well describe my present situation. Line 5 seems to advise me to stay calm and patient and that the situation will slowly change for the better. But how should I understand ""offerings and oblations""? Is this about a state of mind, should I make offerings to God and wait for divine favour, or is it about what I should do to the girl? I was clearly asking for a practical advise to the IC.As for hex 40, it's about releasing tensions. ""If your path has purpose, start your journey as early as you can"". Well, my purpose here is to have an answer from this girl, whether it is positive or not. So what should I start as early as I can? Starting being patient? Starting offerings?Well, as you see, I am a bit lost. How would you interpret this answer?"
777,"Hi everyone,I recently posted about my dog and whether to take her with me to Australia when I go in October, that post was helpful, so now I am writing to ask about my ""stuff"".Long story short, I am going, probably for good having done quite a bit of ""commuting"" between the UK and Australia over the years because of close family in both, and because its unsustainable on all sorts of levels, but for all the economic reasons my house hasn't sold and so I'll be renting it.  This is OK, I'm trusting and going with it, but agents have advised that it may be easier/I may get more reliable tenants if I let unfurnished,  my furniture whilst comfortable and I'm fond of it is not of great value and it would cost as much to ship as to replace, equally I have an older son in the Uk still and plan to come back and visit for his graduation 2012.  When I asked whether to take my furniture or to leave it the Yi replied 64, and previously 49.4 which my reading suggests may be to do with making bolder changes now.  If anyone has got any insights into the meaning they interpret I'd be grateful.  I can't decide if its too soon to decide (I may have sold my house but the lady who wants it hasn't sold hers, she may in a while) or if it means that the whole relocation project won't complete until my elder son finishes Uni and I come back in 2012.Possibly it means it would be good to get rid of everything now so that I don't have to/can't revisit it later, I really don't know, certainly these plans have been 20 years in the offing and I deeply need to move on with my life although there are of course losses.  Perhaps the biggest risks for me are of having a ""fall back"" position and not being bold enough...but that's just speculation and hunch.  I'm nearly 50 so winkling me out of my niche is coming hard though I feel it is needed.Well your thoughts are MOST welcome and bless you for reading my saga!DML xps I'm a Libran metal Rat "
778,"Good day,This is my first post - I asked the question: what do I need to know about my career and got hexagram 1: ch'ien (creative force) with a changing line 5 leading to hexagram 14. Ta Yu (Great Possession).I asked because a job that has been a good fit for for 5+ years is getting stale and I am restless.  I am not sure if I should look outside my organization or inside - a number of changes are happening in the management with more on the way this fall.Thoughts?PS two beginner questions:- what does ""firm and correct"" behavior actually mean?- does the time frame associated with the reading indicate what is happening now? what I might be in the middle of? or what is coming if you find you resonate with the middle of the hexagram?"
779,"Things have been going well with my new friend/date ""M"".  We've been on 4 dates now.  It's not overpowering at all, but it's fun and nice...I'm really enjoying it M asked me Monday to go to the movies w/ him on Thursday.  I was excited and agreed!  Actually, I was looking forward to it all week... He even sent mne a message telling me he ""missed me"".  I was a little thrown ""off"" by that declaration, but it was sweet and I appreciated that he ""mssed"" me.  It made me think he might really be liking me and I like him too..so all seemed terrific......until yesterday when things got confusing.  I didn't hear from him all day and when it got into the evening, I started feeling like he was going to stand me up or something.  It just doesn't seem like him to totally blow our plans and me (!) off like this..so finally I text asking him if we're still on for the night.. an hour later (rude!), he finally responds that he's tired and isn't up to it, that he should have let me know earlier and he's ""sorry"".  Hmmm.... I'm definitely disappointed, but I text back and just say ""ok"".  He then responds by telling me it isn't that he has other plans or anything (I'm grateful for that, I guess), but that he's been ""down lately"" and again says he's ""sorry"".I hate dating!!  I don't want to over analyze this silly stuff..but this doesn't really make sense that we went from ""miss you"" to barely even bothering to cancel plans with me.  I've heard of the phrase, ""He's just not that into you"" and I don't want to miss those signs and live in la-la world about this!  So I ask the IC, ""why did M cancel last night?""Response:  hex 21.2.3.4.6 -->11Looking into this, it's something about ""deception""?  MY mistrust, a bit of ""bad luck"", and perhaps the problem is something inside of me...some issue *I* have? And leading to 11, which seems a fairly positive thing...?Can you please offer some insight into IC's message to me here?  I don't want to be stupid and just not want to sdee the signs of him ""not being into me""...but I like him and I really don't want to jump to the wrong conclusion yet..AND, I surely don't want to jump at him with all these questions et either..seems a bit early to throw that much stress onto this...Thoughts please?Thank you for reading:bows:Sooo.....I asked the IC for advice on whataction I should take, if any, regarding this with M and received:hex 28.4.5 -->46At least this seems to indicate that I was right to consult someone wise regarding this situation!!

780,"I have a bit hearing loss since I was born, but wearing hearing aids does not improve the situation. I can hear most of the time but I just can't comprehend certain people like certain tv shows I miss what people say and two seconds later it registers in my mind.  I'm just slow sometimes and don't have confidence in what people are saying to me for some weird reason.  The problem is rooted much deeper in the mind...almost like mental problem I've created for myself but not intentionally.  Because I hear what people say, but often need them to repeat since I don't comprehend immediately  It's like delayed or cognitive impairment almost or maybe laziness predisposition of the mind.I asked the I-Ching: ""Why can't I comprehend what people are saying to me?' Resulted in Hexagram 4.6 to Hexagram 7.  I read 4.6 and it said something like punishing folly.  Almost as if Im a fool for not following my feelings or being mentally lazy?  And Hexagram 7 means something about discipline....so I get meditation from this?Then I asked what can I do to improve my comprehension? I got Hexagram 50.Does that mean I should do meditation or yoga to nourish the mind?"

788,"Hi everyone,I recently asked iching about my relationship situation between me and my boyfriend. And I got hexagram 41 with changing line 3, 4, and 5. I understand the explanations for line 4 and 5. My question is in line 3, which I think the three people are me, my bf, and his daughter, although I am not 100% sure. The reason why I think his daughter is the third person is because a lot of fights between me and my bf within this one month caused by his daughter. His daughter is a teenager, she gives me attitude sometimes, guess it's because she doesn't like her dad has girlfriends (my bf told me she wants him to hang out with her mom). And my bf never says anything when he sees that, he told me she has her right of having opinion. Plus, when we three hang out, my bf only pays attention to her, and she seems like his gf more than I do. And I can tell she's trying to make me jealous sometimes. I understand that's his daughter, but it's hard to control that weird feeling, especially when I see him does small talks with his daughter. So now my question is, is it the hexagram suggesting me I have to leave because there is no way he will choose me over his daughter? Is that the only solution? I really don't know what to do because I love my bf."

Its all a little petty though music plays a huge part of my life and I don't like much the feeling of being used though I also believe more in rising above things - regardless it stings and I'm not sure if I SHOULD help and risk the same thing happening again… Its got me pretty worked up in the sense that I don't feel positive about even putting my own mixes together at the moment, including the CD I promised to everybody which is not a good thing of course..:bows:"
791,"Another example reading for you, this one for Jennifer Louden, whom I just introduced. I’m reading for as many of the Festival of Change speakers before the event as would like to be read for – obviously, not everyone has something share-able going on that calls for a reading. But Jen does… she’s moved by a strong sense that change wants to happen, that her work wants to move or evolve and something different wants to emerge, but she’s not clear or confident about its shape.Hence her question:‘What’s my next creative calling?‘Yi answers with Hexagram 21, Biting Through, changing at line 1 to 35, Advancing. I think this is actually answering one of her unasked questions just beneath the surface: she has plenty of ideas, but how to discern? And I think that in another layer, it’s also directly answering the question she asked.So here’s the reading (right or control click and choose ’save link as’ or the equivalent to download).It launches straight in without the initial ‘hello’s, because we spent the first five minutes or so talking about how dodgy the Skype connection was, and this is not hugely exciting.And here is a blog post Jen wrote as she was responding to the reading."

793,"Hallo, I have already asked about this man, there is a long and painful history there, but my love was so strong for him always so I'm having a hard time to let him go and accept my life without him there. The timing was always off, he comes when I do not think about him and I come when he is not available. I'm very physically attracted to him and that is so rare in my life. There are many differences between us, different social classes, life and everything else. I was never sure that things with him were viable long term, he was just too way out there, as they say. Yet I would be lying to myself big time if I do not admit to my intense passion  to this person. I'm so confused by my own feelings to him. I asked What are the chances of him and me to be together and the answer I got was 57.1.4 >> 1.Earlier today I asked Can I expect him to contact me and got 11.6 >>26, which I read as a no. I can not see myself chasing after a guy and the situation seems to call for that.I'm not sure in his feeling to me, or if there are any. Any readings are so great for me.I remember the answer before that he will not go back to me. But my hopes are still so alive in me.IlXOXO"
794,"Greetings,Curious to get your opinions on this one...Here is a little background information:  my boss who hired me three years ago got laid off as a result our group was merged with another and consequently, I have a new boss now.  I feel like a step-child where I don't get as much support and direction from the new manager unlike the subordinates who have been working with her prior to the merger.  So I asked Yi ""What does she think of me?"" and got 21.4>27.  In addition, I also asked ""What can I do to move my career ahead in my office?"" and received 23.6>2.   I believe the answer to the second question is pretty straightforward and positive.  23.6>2 advices to stay involved, be receptive and open minded, show my support with company initiatives.

The idea of excess has come up several times hence the question regarding a person with whom I have recently had conflict so I am scratching my head a bit over this answer.  I at first thought this was a positive answer to a negative question but .... HELP!I'm using Thomas Cleary today:Following is greatly developmental and beneficial if correct - following means going along - self and others in accord - acting to the delight of others ... seeking feeling through essence.  Changing to 42. Increase: Augmentation and enhancement. Wind & Thunder Increase.  Thus do superior people take to good when they see it, and correct whatever faults they have.4.  Following has gain.  Even if right, it is inauspicious.  Truthfully remaining on the path, using understanding, what blame is there?  Excessive strength is inauspicious - (being too adamant?)   - not knowing when to advance and when to retreat, not bringing on blame and being blameless oneself - this is the following of strength trusting the Tao.6. Binding and tying up; the King sacrifices on west mountain.When one is foolish and ignorant and is compulsive and whimsical, unable to first go and follow others while wanting others to follow oneself, this is like binding and tying - forced seeking and forced joining - an excess of false ideas.line 4 means using one's spiritual energy improperly?line 6 - an excess of false ideasI think line 4 refers to me and line six to X but I started out asking how my beliefs are hindering my growth and where I should concentrate my self-development and I wound up right back at square one.Master:  Please whack me!

797,"Hallo!It is about a man I knew for the part 6 years, We are always on and off playing games with each other hurting each other. They call it love? He is married now but my feelings are still there. My recent dream brought some nostalgic thoughts. Describe his view on me  I asked the oracle and the answer was 44.1.2 >> 13. Allors, me a sexy influences in his life? For sure!  Any thoughts? XOXO"
798,"i need some help with this answer. the question was about a 'partner' who's away until march. we're not in a conventional relationship, and so far I was satisfied with it ( we've been seeing each other for about 7 months), but now I've developed stronger and deeper feelings. The question was 'what happens when he comes back?' and I'm confused with the answer, precisely, with what should I do?thnx for answering "
799,"I have being lurking behind the scene reading hexagrams interpretations  from experts and novices as well, I learned so much from you and Hilary, Thank you. My marriage is on the brink of collapse or may be it already did collapse. I would like to fie for divorce, since it is the only way to put the past behind me and move on with my life. My husband on the other hand, who already left the home does not want divorce. I pushed for an amiable divorce but then he said if you have to file then file for a legal separation. I know he cannot call the shots after him leaving us but I have kids who are observing everything I do and say to their father.Today I decided to cast a hexagram and share my reading with you all.  I asked the I ching :"" why  was I asked to file for a legal separation rather than a divorce? I got hexagram 26 unchaging. Recharging power. does this hexagram mean that I am exhausted? what does the yi is telling me about my question. I do appreciate your insights on this reading.:bows:"
800,"Hello everyone, how's it going?As some of you might know I've been pursuing a romantic interest for sometime now. It seems that the earlier castings I made about this are falling in to place, and we are indeed growing closer. She left to California (I live in Illinois) for a week and half or so, but we've been in contact. It really seems at times that she's just waiting for me to say something but the situation is fragile at this point, and I don't want to ruin what we've gained by trying to force the advance. So I asked the Yi what x's intentions were for us the next time we saw each other and received 12 with changing lines 5 and 6. This seems like an incredibly positive and accurate reading to the situation. 12 describes where we are at this point; stagnant, no retreat but no advance. The changing lines seem to indicate that the barrier will be broken and progress can be made, but I am interested how the ""mulberry shoots"" and the corresponding hexagram, 16, can be related to the situation.I feel like I've got a basic interpretation that fits, but I would appreciate a more in-depth answer, I feel perspective is always important to a reading. Thanks in advance for your responses, all your time is greatly appreciated. "
801,"Out of the blue I was contacted by a recruiter few days ago about a job opportunity so I asked Yi 'What happens if I pursue this job opportunity?' I received 43.3.4>60 and to my question ""What happens if I don't pursue this job opportunity?"" I got 45.  The way I interpret it Yi is advising not to go after this opportunity.  What do you folks think?  Thank you."
802,"Unfortunately, the person I am very interested in moved away about a month ago and in the process of looking for a job.  I am not intimidated by a long distance and am still interested to see if our relationship could lead to something more serious.  However, I am exceedingly puzzled by his behavior, intentions (if any) and his in consistency in communication.    So I asked  ""what is there Yi would like me to know about X?"" and I got 8.2.4.5>40.  To me, it sounds like he is reserved, keeps his composure at all times and would not chase after anyone.  So today I asked ""what does X want from me now?"" 26.2.3.6>24.   Not quite sure, if I need to be patient or just follow my own path.   Any thoughts or ideas with either reading.  I would greatly appreciate your insight!   In summary:""what is there Yi would like me to know about X?"" 8.2.4.5>40""what does X want from me now?"" 26.2.3.6>24"

804,"well, my new relationship has been going very well and I last spoke with him a couple days ago, we left things at he would call this week, however, he has a big day today and I am tempted to send him a message to let him know I am thinking about him. But since we left it as he would make the next contact, I don't want to scare him off or come off as clingy...i asked should I send him the message? received hex 2.6-->23is it better for me to not send him the message 45.2.6-->6I am pretty sure that the readings confirm I should not send him anything and just let it be till he contacts me, but I just want to throw this out there to make sure I've got it right?"
805,"Hi its Hebe - Having been advised by the I CHing a couple of weeks ago to be still regarding whether or not to do the Huna Retreat - I noticed that I'm still keen althought the great excitement and impulsiveness has gone.  So, a good time to check I thought - and I asked if the Huna Retreat would be progressive for me.  It answered with an unchanging 59.  This looked great - unblocking obstacles, dispelling illusions - just what I need.  Then the more I read - especially the threads - I began, once again ,to question my interpretation and thought that maybe it meant that all these courses are coming up but until I unblock my own obstacles of rushing into things and panicking to try and find some sort of course/answer - then I would continue to err and make mistakes.  So a while later I asked about this - bearing in mind my lack of confidence in myself to make my decisions and not fully understanding the answer - is the retreat right for me now in October?  and I got hexagram 52 with moving lines 2 and 4.  So then I knew I had to take a step back - but I just remain in the confusion of whether its the right thing or not! - I put an exclaimation mark - but really it does bother me alot and I my head gets so full with trying to understand.  Any thoughts?"
806,"And so the big date transpired, dinner, show, coffee after.  It had many interesting and entertaining moments and we are so much alike, share so many tastes and opinions, the territory was new but still fairly familiar in some respects.  In short, I like him as much as I thought I did.  How did he fare?  Quien sabe, but he seemed happy enough, said he enjoyed his evening tremendously, yet still in a sense noncommittal about it all [just a feeling I had that nothing further was planned] and a bit preoccupied by phone messages about a tricky birth in progress in his family -- which anyone can understand of course.OK, asking the Yi, what was the import of the evening for the future?  Hex 30.2 becoming Hex 14.  I take this changing line as a ""spark"" and a new beginning, something that, despite nervous moments, still came through loud and clear as a connection.  Hex 14 -- we have a huge amount in common, more than I had thought, and a lot of the same values.  BUT, what does it mean for the future?  Psychic personnages, unless you are WF, butt out."
807,"I'd like to share this reading with you all and welcome any insights you may have. I am looking at the possibility of taking a new college course. I have taken a couple courses in this subject passed them both and now want to take the next step up to a higher qualification.I have been offered places on the same course at 2 local colleges both within a 20 minute drive of my home. Taking the course is going to mean some major changes to my work, family and home commitment balance. So I'm sitting here feeling a bit anxious about what is quite a big step and about which would be the best colledge to attend for me.I asked Yi What is your general overview of my taking this course?13:1.3.4.5>23  (Concording People >Stripping)It's a good course for me to be doing with other people around and now looks to be the right time to be doing it. There's a few personal issues I'm going to have to sort out and other people around me may not accept easily why I want to do the course, in the end though their views will be swayed by the commitment I show to it. It's going to be good for me as it'll be like a new broom sweeping away the cobwebs.  Now I wanted to see which course might be best for me.What if I take the course at college A? 32 UnchangingWhat if I take the course at college B? 32 UnchangingThis this sort of spooked me - I asked the questions within a couple of minutes of each other and  I can't remember a time before when I got exactly the same answer one right after the other liek this. It looks to be saying that I have to take the course persevere and get the higher qualification and it's not going to matter too much which college I go to.What do you people see in this ?Not content with this response I pushed a bit moreWhat are the advantages of taking the course at college A?35.6 >16  Prospering > Providing forMaybe a bit of a rude awakening. I'm going to be shown in this course what the subject is really all about and not what I think it's all about. In the end though it's going to be to my greater advantage and for those around me.What are the advantages of taking the course at college B? 44: 2.5 >56  Coupling >SojourningHere it's going to be a bit less 'traumatic' and it's not going to be how I expect it to be. Perhaps I'm not going to fit in so well and there will be frustrations resulting from that, but on the plus side I'll be able to focus more on my study. These last two questions are where I'm still looking for some clarity. My gut feeling is for college A...... What do you people think?Many ThanksMike"
808,"Hello I have just starting reading about the I Ching and my head is swimming with too much information! I asked this question : If I completed (an accountancy) course what would the affect be on my chances of getting a job?A bit of background: I graduated in engineering in 2008 and have been unemployed ever since. I am looking at accountancy because there are a few jobs that keep popping up in my area. The problem is is that the course is very expensive and I don't want to waste money (I haven't got!) on doing if it will not benefit job prospects.Phew! Now for the fun part...The answer I got was 26.2.3.6 > 24Now, my interpretation is that line two is saying that I am stuck, due to recession. Line 3 is that I should do the course; Practice chariot driving... (wish it was that exciting) And six is using the skills I have learnt and applying them in a job. I should harvest knowledge. The only problem is, I have an opposite interpretation because of the mountain stilling the creativity, so maybe I should not do the course and just keep looking for work! 24 is interesting as well because it says to me that if i do the course the darkness of unemployment is lifted and a new year, fresh start is before me.Any input would of your seasoned knowledge would be greatly appreciated because at the moment I can not see the wood for the trees! Insanity is looming, but having said that I am really enjoying the Book of Changes!"

810,"This question is about interpreting 21-->54 which I got when I asked about my marriage.  ""is it over?"".  We have been separated since Aug 2007, we have always argued quite a bit, he has a very harsh tongue. I find arguing excruciatingly painful. Recently my life was devastated by the death of my truly beloved daughter, she and he had never even met due to unfortunate circumstances.  But technically he was still her stepfather.  During her illness he was very supportive through calls and prayer.  But after her death, he went back to his harsh ways and told me by phone that a plan that I was contemplating was doomed to failure. He was so mean and cruel that it took my breath away. (My daughter was involved in fashion and I had planned to sell her large collection of fashionable shoes)  I was already very low  in spirits, and my husband's  harsh attack was very painful  He then hung up on me and refused to take my subsequent calls. Since that time he has never called me to offer any kindness or support.  This was around 2 weeks ago.Until that time he has been making a lot of promises to me and my son, my only other child.  My son was beginning to count on him and to forgive him for past offenses. Now, it's been  total silence.  He is very success and society orientated, is concerned about social and monetary success.  Now that things have gone very south for me, his life is looking up.  I wish him the best, but I can't help thinking that this is not was a good husband does.  Can a person be considered a friend if he abandons you in your darkest hour, after provoking you and insulting you over the phone?Who is x to me --> 12 unchanging.The I Ching constantly gives me positives about him which I find very disconcerting.  I have been very unhappy with him in the past. It's only because he pursued me and worked hard to convince me that I even considered going back to him. He was constantly calling me for these long silent calls, where I would try to fill the silence with chitchat, or advice or whatever.  He was constantly telling me he loved me and then insulting me or criticizing me harshly.  He then hangs up, or refuses to speak, forcing me to hang up.  He then waits 2weeks and calls me again, full of lovey-dovey sentiments.  This is be going on ever since I left him.What is my future with X -->19.2-->24Does this mean that this man will continue this pattern for the rest of our lives?Will X ever treat me with love and kindness?40.3.4.5-->24What is my destiny with X37 unchangingDoes this mean that we are a family, despite the unhappiness of our marriage?We live in different nations.  I am considering cutting everything short by divorcing him in a very short while, because I would like to find more kindness and harmony than he has offered me.What will happen if I divorce X?22.3.6-->24I don't understand all these 24's?   Does this mean that we get back together or that I go back to my true self?I have also been getting a lot of 62's.  I have never appreciated this Hexagram or understood it very well for that matter.  Is there anybody out there who would care to comment on the Hex results which I received?  I would really appreciate any helpful insight.Thank you,Booie"
811,"I've had it! I concentrated and asked, What can be expected if I cease consultation of the Yi Jing?47.5.6 changing to 64.The way I interpret it, it is something I personally need to do, regardless of regrets about doing so. It helped me realize I've become weirdly dependent on the Yi Jing for action. The more I work with the text, the more I realize how much I have to learn about it. It is truly an astounding and rewarding thing, but not at all something to take for granted, which I admit I have done too often.In a way I feel more intuitive from having consulted the Yi Jing, but at the same time, I feel I have grown hesitant to trust that intuition without much--too much--internal deliberation. In fact, frequent Yi Jing consultations have in a way replaced simple introspection for me, or at least, the ""divination habit"" has become a catalyst for initiating that introspection, often when it is not really necessary.For now, I think I will put the book(s) away. It was a very interesting reading, so I thought I'd post it. Thanks for being an insightful web community. I haven't posted here much, but I've certainly got a lot of useful advice through this site/forum.:bows:"

I posted about my search in another thread and Rosada had me ask what is my purpose her in earth as it pertains to employment. The answer was interpreted to mean that I wanted meaningful work and not just a paycheck. I thought this would be impossible to find but yesterday I saw an ad for an organization that I would like to be a part of. I emailed my cover letter and resume and then asked if they would call me for an interview and I got 17.6-25i always go to Lise first when I feel vulnerable and want a gentle reading but I think it sounds really hopeful that they will contact me.17.6 from LiseAbove 6: Embracing it and relating to it. Therefore following it and netting it. The king offers a Heng-sacrifice at the Western Mountain.When man is grasped completely by something, then it is good to make contact with higher or more-than-human things. Gods speak the words that live in the deepest realm of the soul, and they will make him follow what is essentially him. Then he can never lose his own way, and he will find his direction of life. And only then it is possible to accomplish things with eternal value.(Changes to hex.25)"
813,"I am sorry to be such a pest!  i do truly wish I had the funds to pay for a professional to read for me but I just can't find any extra money right now. Thank to all for your generous help here.I asked:  ""What is my purpose in life - what should I be doing with me?""Line 2 : ‘The chasm has sheer sides. Seek small gains.’I interpret this to mean it's dangerous to be overly ambitious in solving life's problems and that by reading the corresponding line of Hex 8:‘Seeking union’s origin, inside.Constancy, good fortune.’Going inside for the answers is what will work for me now ..... but I was asking the question with more of a career path in mind rather than my relationship.  Interesting though, in my journal almost a year ago today when I asked what the future of my relationship with Dave was going to be, I got the same Hex.  A few days later when I asked what Dave wants with me:  Same answer.  At the time, I read this as a go ahead with the relationship and went for it!  And step by step, I have been rather miserable in the meantime Please, somebody tell me how I have misinterpreted  this line and help me to know how to get the union I am seeking inside and out? "

Some of us never grow up Correct conduct: socialization, manners, knowing how to comport oneself, maintaining composure, not creating a scene by acting immaturely, not embarrassing oneself in public or in private, not creating shame for oneself or others, not breaking down and loosing it completely just for drama.

(hope I did that right - I no speak HTML)My father was a man who liked his women jealous of him.  He fostered competition and there was one between my step-mother and I over his attention.  I was such a brat!  I told her I didn't have to do what she told me to do, she was not my mother.  I told him it was me or her and he picked her.  What did that twist in me?

How does one fix this altogether undesirable trait one has suddenly acknowledged as being the primary reason for all one's relationship failures?  Crap!  Back to the couch for me!Sorry for intruding the personal stuff but that's the way I relate to people.  Maybe too much information for some but this also adds clarity to something about Hex 23 that had eluded me as well.

815,"Did a reading yesterday and today about two different, but somewhat relative issues and I think I've got a fairly good idea of the message in them. but I'd really like some insight from here for a better (and more objective) understanding!Yesterday I asked about an issue with ""M""...a very strange and detailed issue that may have had more to do with MY fears than anything really about him, but I had to ask IC..  had this really strange and sudden feeling about him....and it wasn't a good ""feeling"" but rather very unsettling ""suspicious"" type sense...rarely do i have those without something to prompt them..so this really threw me off.  Asked the IC what it was about and received : Hex 2.1.2. -->19Then later yesterday, I had to make a choice regarding ""M"".  I was very undecided about being honest and straight or vague and subtly deceitful (but the latter is what would have been the most considerate).  I'm just not at all used to the whole dating scene!  I'm learning as I go...or trying to!!  Now, I realize all over again why I dislike dating so much!!!  I'm just not good at it!!  Anyway, true to myself, I chose the difficult, but straight and honest response.  ASked IC about how that choice went and received Hex30.6. --> 55.Thanks for reading this..I'd love and appreciate your thoughts as i find my way through this strange and unknown land of ""dating""!!!:bows:"

Yi advised me with 21, lines 3 and 5 changing to 13.  The question was what is your best advice about trading.I wish there would be 14 somewhere in the picture , but there is none.I always had trouble with 21, problem solving I guess?Could it be that the advice here is to kinda forget about the idea, it's too risky and dangerous, and go play with other kids in the yard?Thanks.-CCLast edited: Aug 11, 2010"
817,"Hi All,  Any insight would be really appreciated.  My dog is really sick and I'm debating whether to put him through a surgery.  My instinct says to do it, but I'm concerned he won't make it.  My choice is surgery and a better chance at longterm results, or keep him going best I can before he will need to be put to sleep (likely be quite soon)Will Bobby make it through surgery?

819,"Hi guys,I am going to begin with practising scrying very soon. To those of you that don't know what scrying is, let me explain. Scrying is basically traveling to the astral realms. Usually this is done through crystall balls or black mirros, but can also be done in meditation(shamanic journeys). What you do is, you hold an image or a symbol in your mind and then travel through the door of that image in the astral realm and see what that symbol/image is all about. So for example if you want to get to know hexagram 19 better, you travel with that symbol in the astral realms and get to know it more.Anyways, my question to the iching was: What are the prospects if I begin practising scrying? and I got hex 50.2>56 as answer.I lol'd when I read hex 56 which means traveling/foreign countries, that's basically what scrying is all about. But I have a question on the second line. How can this line express itself, I mean it says that your friends may even envy you and such, but can It also mean other groups/people aswell? are my friends seriously going to  envy me? They also practise these types of things, but not scrying.Can it mean that other spirits in those realms will confront me? So what say you?Last edited: Aug 10, 2010"
820,"Sorry, more question.OK, I'm in a bad moment of my life now. I see my future with hungry eyes, but I can't find a job. I'm a foreigner, living in another country for more than one year now. I had one very simple job as soon as I arrived, but I decided to leave some time ago, because my boss was interested in me.It has been now 5 months looking for another job in a better position (related to my previous experience in my original country), but noone even calls me for interview. I had only one interview in these 5 months (it was great, because I was called to the second interview too), but I didn't get it.I don't know what is wrong with me. If the problem is because I'm a foreigner. It is upsetting.So I asked IC: What is the new outcome for my professional life (what is going to happen in the near future)? And I got 21.1.3>56I have read some previous posts here about 21.1 and 21.3, but I couldn't find any reading related to the wanderer as second hex. And the wanderer is really interesting me. I could read that both 21.1 and 21.3 are mild obstacles that I cannot avoid, because they are not really my fault. But the wanderer.... does it mean the reason is really because I am a foreinger, or that I don't have friends to recommend me to anyone or is it saying I will have to move again as to fight these obstacles?The wandering about the reason for not getting jobs being I'm a foreigner was not on my head when I asked IC. On the contrary, I was really hopefull of a nice answer .Thank you friends, once more.xxxIesha"

But I have poet friends that are used to create pen names to create different things and not to be related to the person's already know work, in case it is received as a bad work, for example.So I asked:who is this name(pen name)?10.1.4>59Is X (a poet I know) related to this pen name?43.2.5.6>30Is this work a re-reading/re-creation based on my work?57.5.6>46I would really appreciate your help this time.

I asked to look at 2 scenarios.One is that I 'give up' and move my daughter and I from LA to Seattle to be with the man I'm dating, and the question was 'Seattle to Culebra?' which means Seattle then creating an eco low-tech hotel/ spa in Culebra... like is that the easiest route?The Yi said 42.1.6 to Hex 8The second scenario was LA first ?Answer: Hex 14.3.4 to Hex 41.The ideal is the latter, as we both have 'brands' we're working on repositioning that are lucrative and this is a step FORWARD for both of us, and a better life for my daughter... but there's been obstacles lately.I 'get' from this, that LA has 'wealth' inside the potential, but it's how we cultivate it.I'm interested in the juxtaposition of increase in the Seattle situ vs the decrease in LA.Wonder if that means LA doesn't get us to Culebra, but Seattle does?And does that matter?It's all in the journey of course.... "
825,"I thought long and hard about the situation and asked ""how do I do this, what directions should I take?"" I got 57 with lines 2,3 and 4.I don't know what I want or what I am doing. I am recently separated and while I enjoy the peace that the separation has given me, I also feel lonely and as if I shouldn't give up so easily. The person whom I have separated from is perfect (in my eyes) in many ways except for a few things that I simply cannot put up with. One being their total lack of trust for me. Their constant questioning and doubting of my every move infiltrated my own mind leaving me unaware at times if it was their doubt or my own self-doubt that invaded my thoughts. A few months ago I asked them to leave. It felt great, as if a big weight was lifted off my shoulder.  As I mentioned, I enjoy the independence and peace that I feel. But I can't deny that I miss them. There is still passion, no longer much respect however. It hurts me when they are mean to me, it makes me sad and I cry. I feel unsatisfied, lonely and empty. Why couldn't they just have trusted me? What is it about me that is so untrustworthy? Or was it their own issues that made them treat me that way? And will I ever trust myself again? After all that time ""walking on eggshells"", trying to do things right for them, trying to have their approval, who am I? What do I really want? I feel so  lost. I feel that hexagram 57 is saying that I have some sort of seal, or ""way"" of being, of existing and that it is just there and there isn't much I can do about it. This makes me feel hopeless. Am I destined to feel this way? To be confused and make poor choices? This ""seal"" seems to have dictated much of my life.Line 2: Should I accept the person the way they are and settle for the perfectness I see in them, forgetting the things about them that make me feel completely sad and empty, never good enough, never true?Line 3: I am thinking about it too much. I need to just stop and let things do what they will do. ???Line 4: Accept this person for who they are. Accept the situation and be grateful. Grow from this experience. This is good. I am learning. I deserve the best. I don't know what to think or do. My feelings and thoughts are all mixed up and I am having a hard time distinguishing between the two. I ask the community to please give me insight and remarks on this reading. I really appreciate it."
826,"I always tend to look at multiple lines by seeing them as a sequence inside the question I am asking - as further below a moving line is (say for example 3 lines are moving) as earlier in the unfolding process and as higher up, as later. I asked the book about this approach and got 38.2 to 21. Well, only one line changing. However, there is the master in the narrow lane, apparently King Wen, is supposed to help me to remove the misunderstanding. There is also a hint that the meeting is coincidental and that I should not be embarrased to meet my master. I guess it means that there is not a straightforward answer to the question of multiple lines changing. Even one line changing can already be confusing enough, as it is in this case. I guess I have to accept this. This brings me to the resulting hexagram, 21, something between my teeth I need to bite through, but how? I fear that I have to accept that there is not this wonderful sequential order I would like to be in the book of change. Multiple lines remain a problem even the book can't come up with a straight forward answer, I guess."
827,"Lately I have been feeling like it is time to deal with something that I had put aside a long time ago but never really had closure on. I felt like I needed to separate myself and work on myself before I could understand it and my feelings concerning the other person involved. So in order to help me understand I asked the I Ching ""Why do I still want to be with this person? 54 unchanging. -I was very attached to this person and it seems I still am even though 54 represents an unequal and negative relationship.Then I asked, ""Based on this 54 I received, please advise me on the way to move forward concerning this person (moving forward as in getting past this or ""unstuck"" in this area of my life). The answer was 14.2.5 to 13. -This sounds like in speaking humbly and sincerely with this person there will come closure and peace to this situation after all this time and distance so that this will no longer be a nagging part of my life experience. That, or it is saying the wisdom learned from this experience will benefit me in my current and future connections with those around me?Out of indulgence and in the desire to know if I was a more positive than negative experience in this person's life I asked, ""In what way does this person remember me?""  58.2 to 17. -Seems to me that I offered only ""inferior pleasures"" (even though I felt like I was offering much more than that and it didn't feel inferior to me) and he has no regrets about resisting them in the end and through his experiences with me, has learned to trust and follow his inner voice and higher principles. Either that or he sees me as someone doing this. Either way it sounds like I shouldn't contact him because it seems one of us isn't good for the other. So maybe it isn't a good idea to have a conversation even if just to bring harmony and closure to the past.I must say that 58 confuses me. For a hexagram which is Joy over Joy it seems to talk a lot about keeping others from defining or reducing your joy and very little about being joyful or sharing it. Maybe I am confusing the idea of Joyous with Hex 16, Enthusiasm. I would really appreciate others' ideas on these hexagrams and lines. There is always something I am missing. Thanks.

828,"Hi everyone.  Well, in the past I have asked not one but three times the same question (not all at once).  I'm not proud to have asked it, and I'm not proud to be admitting to it, but I have felt the need to do so.  I asked the IC  Will I ever have a fulfilling sex life? The first response was hexagram 25 with lines 2.3.5.6 changing to 34.  I believe that 25 is about having no expectations and 34 is giving the advice to not abuse power.  I don't want to pressure anyone to do anything they don't want to or are not ready for; and I don't want to be a pushy jerk.  I'm not interested in hurting anyone to fulfill my own selfishness.The second response gave me hexagram 22 with lines 3.5 changing to 42.  I believe that 22 is about outward appearances. I believe that 42 is about increase, but I've also heard that it can be about sacrifice. Maybe some people will think 42 makes things pretty straightforward, but I just don't feel that it is.The third response gave me hexagram 13 with lines 2.5 changing to 14.  I found an old post on this site where someone was explaining that hexagram 13 with lines 2 and 5 can be about a marriage, but I still feel 13's focus is on companionship.  I know there are a fair number of marriages that are strictly for companinoship and don't have much in the way of intimacy or passion.  Honestly, I really don't want to be in a sex-starved marriage.I admit that this is a subject that causes me great anxiety.  I really have a lot of emotions tied up in it.  I guess, from a psychological point-of-view, this stems from living through a childhood of parental rejection.  My parents were not very affectionate in any type of way.  I was even having a conversation with my father a couple of years ago where he literally said ""How often was your mother kissing and hugging on you?""  I answered the truth when I told him never.  He said ""Exactly!""  I've lived with rejection from my parents, and I've faced a lot of rejection from the small handful of romantic mates I've had so far.  One of the forms of rejection I've faced from romantic mates in the past has been sexual rejection.  I think a couple of them may not have been physically attracted to me.  I won't lie, it hurt me very badly. It has and still hurts me so badly that I'm afraid of ever getting involved again.  I just don't have the emotional fortitude to face the rejection and the pain again.Don't get me wrong, I don't want to just use someone, or be used by someone.  I want to be in a long-term, committed, monogamous relationship with someone.  I want us to like each other as people. I want for us to be friends and to get along with each other and to care about each other.  But I'm not going to lie to myself or anyone else about the fact that sex is important to me.  I know some people just want platonic companionship, and I'm not judging anyone for that.  I'm not opposed to being just platonic friends with such people, but at the same time I don't want to go down the path of trying to date a person like this.  And I don't understand why some people who are interested in sex will date someone they are not sexually attracted to.At this point, I'm honestly kind of afraid of the opposite sex.  If I must resign myself to a celibate life, then I need to begin to mentally, spiritually and emotionally prepare myself for this.Thank you to everyone for reading this very long post. And I have much appreciation to anyone who has any views on the three readings listed above."
829,"Greetings all!I would be very grateful for any insights you can give in this matter.I have a major problem at the moment - that is to make a decision,may be i have too many options and have hard time choosing, may be it'sfears of all sorts that plagueing me.Basically, my question about the best advice Yi can give me on my decisionmaking ability gave me hex 47 with line 5, it changes to 40.There are many aspects in this decision and it is extremely hard to make some sort of ""objective"" choice. Additionally there are other peoplein the picture and I have to take it into consideration as well.Curious about your insights.-CCP.S.

830,"Surprise!  It’s another guy/relationship question!!I’m in a new city and have decided to actually put at least a little effort toward dating. (This is a big decision and change for me, as I’ve trapped myself for years now in a going no-where-after-the-break-up love affair!)After meeting a few different guys (just not much interest on my part tho), I recently met one who I actually found myself interested in and somewhat attracted to as wellAfter our first date, I asked the IC to give me a little insight into this connection and I received Hex 36.4 --> 55 and looking around the archives here tells me that’s just not all that promising for something good...This past Friday, we had date #2 and it seems to have gone well.  I enjoyed him and am very interested in continuing to get to know him/date him. So I asked IC to give me a picture of the dynamics surrounding this and received Hex 56.3.5-->12…..more very UNpromising stuff…ughh..Having a bit of a tantrum here that I can’t recall the IC often (if ever?) giving me *any* positive feedback on a romantic question.  I had convinced myself not to let that get me down before bc my previous ongoing “situation”  really didn’t have any healthy or positive dynamics surrounding it…so I could accept the constant negativity bc it just seemed valid and realistic (whether I liked it or not!)I’m not particularly desperate for a relationship by any means….nor am I sure I even want some full fledged, BIG thing romantically right at the moment..  However, I am getting older, have done a lot of work on myself to heal from my past relationship, have been “alone” for nearly 5 years…and DO have big hopes and dreams at not spending the rest of my life without a significant other…All of which the IC seems to dash almost immediately…and seemingly nearly  *every* time I even start to think, “hmm…maybe this could be something nice…?”  It’s getting to the point of depressing here…..and kinda as though I’m just foolish to even hope to someday share my life with someone!  Would greatly appreciate any thoughts (or encouragements?!) regarding this silly little rant of mine!"

In addition, my experience for the past 6 years is in working with sexually abused children and I really know I need to get away from that career area as it was not healthy for my mental (or physical) state over a long period of time...So I asked IC for advice and insight on how to get a job that's right for me?Response:  Hex 40.2.6. -->35This looks wonderfully promising(yayy!!)...but I'm not hearing any real ""advice"" from it.

834,"Firstly may I thank you for the forum;please forgive my jumping straight-in for advice,it is not something I have done without much pondering and Google(ing). My situation is quite simple,I have recently changed job twice within a year,after my previous job lasted for over 20 yrs - but became intolerable. My new job is very different and not secure yet I feel strong enough not to be overly concerned. I asked i-ching about a young woman I have just started working with,she's much younger than me (a lot) yet she initially showed a lot of interest in me,I enjoyed this attention and our friendship was easily noticed in the small training group we are both members of. She was teased - and it was embarrassing for both of us,in fact I felt like a ""dirty old man"" (I'm early 40's but look and behave much younger). I decided to let the situation fizzle-out but as corny as it sounds (I'm also aware that long term the relationship is unrealistic) she has woken something up inside me,I felt like I was falling in love,not love,just falling,but a feeling I've not really felt before. Anyway,I'm very intuitive and have been since about 9 yrs old;I decided to leave the situation - just seemed best. Yet somehow,for some reason I want to contact her again,thus my i-ching which was 51 changing line 3 & 43. I've searched this site and a few others but I'm not sure if this is suggesting I push or retreat - any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again P1"
835,"Six months ago, I first asked about this relationship, which has since been through various ups and downs.  Most recently I decided to let go and stop wondering about this man; leave him to his own thoughts.  I thought that would be an end of it.  But, after a week or so of silence, he began turning up along the way with apparent ""serendipity.""  Now I realise, he was making opportunities to talk. And today he's asked me to the theatre next week, which I accepted.Now I want to know if this is for real and what to expect from here forward.  I'm never good at phrasing relationship questions, but here goes.  I asked ""What is the future effect of this evening out?""  The result:  Hexagram 42.1.2.4.5, becoming Hexgram 64.  I'm never that happy with Hexagram 64 because I simply can't relate to it's significance in a practical situation.  The changing lines look marvelous -- I always love the ten thousand tortoises line that sounds just abundantly positive -- but when the outcome is 64 I'm just concerned because that is relatively meaningless to me."
836,"Contemplating a certain course of action, two readings: a) result if I move forward - 12.2.5b) result if I do nothing - 7.4It would seem from this that either is acceptable, but I'm wondering if 12.2.5 is giving me a nudge."

839,"Hi, IC Fam: First and foremost, I'm kind of new to this. Well sort of a novice and have been using the interpretations of Karcher and Huang for about 6 months now. Find them both enlightening. I love this IC forum. Very informative and a wealth of helpful interpretations to similar questions I ask the IC. The people here are GREAT! I'm very grateful for you all.   My question or should I say dilemma:  For about 3 yrs now I have been in love with this man. I have gotten hot and cold responses from him. For about 1 month now, after a nasty discussion, we have stopped communicating. He pretty much made it clear that he doesn't feel the same way I feel for him. I feel I should just leave it all alone and move on with my life. Yet this person is frequently on my mind and i still feel a connection to him. So I asked the IC ""Where do I go from here with X?"" I received Hex 27.6 > 24. Karcher says Hex 27 Nourishing is to ""go back and correct things. Have no fear. The way is open"" Yet I don't understand what he means by ""launch a brand new enterprise. Your ideas will be rewarded if you do."" Then he says ""something significant is returning. Be open and provide what is needed."" Huang says ""Nourishing is completed...'The sage is aware of the danger and overcomes all difficulties while crossing great rivers. It portends great blessings."" I believe the IC is telling me to not be afraid. Go back and fix the problem. Honestly, I'm a bit apprehensive because i don't want to go back to the same negative cycle of trying and not getting nowhere with this person. Karcher's ""Adversity, hungry souls and angry ghosts"" are probably the past bad memories that I don't want to re-live. Also I have asked the IC a few questions previously, all within a month or two, about this person and constantly I get Hex 24 Return/Turning Back as a future hexagram. Is it so clear that this means he will come back to me on his own? So my next question was, ""When he returns will it be sincere and real?"" IC response was Hex 43.1.3.5 > 40. I get this to mean there will be a Breakthrough (Hex 43) but there may be some difficulties. Can someone please interprete what the changing lines mean cause the are a bit confusing to me? But  it seems the difficulties will be removed Hex 40 Deliverance. Deliverance also says, Leggs Interpretation, ""Advantage in southwest. There will be good fortune in coming back to the old condition..Superior person forgives errors and deals gentiy with crimes"". I guess it would be good for him to come back; or for me to take him back; and for me to forgive him or vicer versa.   I tried to get a timeframe. I know Hex 24 is around Spring but the Spring has passed already. Is there another timeframe since I am asking now?I would really appreciate some clarificiation. Is there something else I should be considering here that the hexagrams are saying? I am grateful for any insight from the IC forum Fam on this matter.TY very much. :bows:Last edited: Aug 3, 2010"
840,"HiI'm currently applying for a canadian school and a scholarship opportunity arose for me, the thing is that I'm very worried that maybe I'm not the candidate that they're looking for so I asked the Yi ""What do I need to do in order to get the scholarship at VFS?"" and got 1.2.4 > 37.I see both lines in hex 1 as me having to show my true greatness but not by academic merit but perhaps for talent and desire, however I just don't understand how hex 37 fits in the reading context.

843,"Hey all! Thank you for reading my post. There is this person in my life that I do not really like and surprisingly I find it hard to get rid of him. I do interact with him once in a while, as a former co-worker and just a soul I can talk to, but otherwise he is pretty useless and quite annoying. He wants something with me, but this will never happen. So I asked how about I stop interacting with this weirdo altogether and  got 42.3.4 to 13. I truly cannot stand him but he is very very clingy. This reading seems to advise me on how to go about it - bu talking to him? Hmmmmmm. Not sure what I can say to him. He seems to be not all there. -CC"

852,"Hi its HebeToday I had we had a really great couple counselling which left us both feeling energised and uplifted.  There is a Huna retreat which the counsellor is running in October which I feel really drawn to bit it clashes with a course I've already started but am feeling unsure about (Rosen Method).  I feel so drawn to the Huna Retreat I want to cancel the course I've booked but i felt resistant to asking the I ching about cancelling and then booking this in case I got a negative response.  Pondering this in some depth I asked about having an image for not trusting my own feelings but being dependent on the I Chings input.  I got 26 with lines 1, 2 and 5.  Having bought the books Ginnie recommended - RL Wing and Blofeld and felt the answers I was drawn to ask if I should stop asking the I Ching questions for a while as I felt that I was being shown to just stop for a bit. Really think things through.  I got 52 unmoving!Am not sure if the I Ching was asking me to stop and think about what and why I want to change course - or to stop being so dependent on its input.  Do you have any thoughts here?  Hebe"
853,"Hi and thank ou for taking an interest in my saga  My newly found abilities are completely off now, nothing comes up about people. I'm obviously very curious about exploring them further and I'd love to turn them back on and to gain control over my own mind. The inquiry to Yi on how can  i turn this on again gave me 52, line 4 with 56 as a result. I think that it offers me to meditate or somehow fidn that light? How do I go about it? I was thinking about joining a group, but I could not find anything reputable in my area...Thanks1-CC"
854,"Some background to this… Pamela Moss is one of the speakers for Festival of Change; I asked her to talk about integration, carrying change through in practice, as I happen to know she’s Very Good At This, and she said ‘yes’, and I danced round the room a bit, in a reserved, English sort of way.It occurred to me that if I gave each speaker a reading, that reading might turn out to be the kind we could share, and then the recording would be a really good introduction to the speaker. Plus it’s an example reading, and that’s never a bad thing. (I may or may not be able to follow up with readings featuring all the speakers – they might not need one now, and if they do it might not prove ’share-able’. But I’ll post as many as I can.)So here, with Pam’s permission (thank you, Pam {""lightbox_close"": ""Close"",""lightbox_next"": ""Next"",""lightbox_previous"": ""Previous"",""lightbox_error"": ""The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later."",""lightbox_start_slideshow"": ""Start slideshow"",""lightbox_stop_slideshow"": ""Stop slideshow"",""lightbox_full_screen"": ""Full screen"",""lightbox_thumbnails"": ""Thumbnails"",""lightbox_download"": ""Download"",""lightbox_share"": ""Share"",""lightbox_zoom"": ""Zoom"",""lightbox_new_window"": ""New window"",""lightbox_toggle_sidebar"": ""Toggle sidebar""}  ) is a reading I did for her about her possibility portraits. To explain… she has a two-branched sort of business. She started out painting portraits that help people see and remember their real self and real possibilities; now, she’s branched out into business mentoring for heart-centred people. (What I’ll be asking her about during the Festival draws on both of these – what it is that helps people who see the possibilities move from there to realising them.)Anyway, the business mentoring has been growing and getting time and attention, and Pam asked for her reading to be about the possibility portraits and what to do with them. So here it is: right-click to download the mp3.(Oh, about the beginning part about complementary hexagrams – Pam is somewhat familiar with the Yi; I obviously wouldn’t start off like this with someone who wasn’t. And the previous reading, the hexagram 20 one, is mentioned here.)"

856,"Hello, I got this reading when asking if a man I am ""talking"" to intentionally tried to make me jealous or hurt me by talking to a girl that he knows I have an issue with. There is nothing going on between them and she has no interest in him so his behavior was quite shocking and random. However, I had been really busy and was (unintentionally) ignoring him prior to this. I think I got the interpretation down that he was sad about my not paying attention to him (line 5) and wanted to punish me (line 6)but now I am wondering if this could also mean he has a change of heart about me (line 5) and wants her now (line 6) I am probably overeacting and we are back to flirting and talking but I guess I am just looking for some unbiased insight from others in what you think may be going on in these lines? :bows:"

I sent him a birthday card today (late) I asked 'How will e react to te card I sent' I recieved Hexagram 5 lines 3/4/5/6 changing to 38I understand that 5 is all about marking time. I think it says that he will respond but only in his own time? lines 3/4 seem quite ominous, but 5/6 seem to be very positive. I am not sure about the three uninvited guests though! What could that relate to I wonder? and 38 is about conflict between women isn't it? Thanks for your help"

861,"being consistent with the YiHi all, Deleted these two readings because they were very similar to readings I've already gotten and since I have the Yi's prior advice to go by, along with the forum's kind counsel in helping interpret those, I'm abiding by them. (Thanks, WF, for pointing that out below.)I've consistently found when I take the counsel the Yi offers, and I listen and take in the great feedback kindly given here, things proceed well; fussing about only diverts my energy and distracts my aims.Thanks, all.

What should I do about R? And got 04.1>41.It is interesting the fact that it is like double 41 (4.1=41?). Maybe IC is just saying: back off for life, dear! Or am I missing the biggest picture?

866,"Hi everyone . . I finally got over my ex husband (it took just over 3 years!) and I met someone recently who I have just started to date.  He is completely different from previous boyfriends/husbands in the sense that he seems very grown up, responsible and not in the least bit 'needy'.  I haven't consulted the I Ching for absolutely ages with regard to anything but last night I cast a few questions, as follows:-""What sort of relationship can I have with X?""Hex 33.2.3.4.5.6 to hex 2""How does X view me?""Hex 17.1.6 to hex 12I kinda get the feeling he thinks that I am blocking communication as he texted me a couple of days ago and asked if ""I had forgotten about him and was I playing it cool"".  It was said very tongue in cheek and in a joking manner but I got the feeling that this is what he thought.  Not sure if my interpretation sounds accurate?""WHat does X want from me?""Hex 31.1.2 to hex 43I was relieved not to get either hex 22, 44 or 12 and was glad to see 31 come up however I'm at a loss to see where the hex 43 fits in.  Its not a hex I feel at all comfortable with.  But then I guess it's never that black and white is it?Anyways, I would be so grateful for your valuable feedback . . .Warmest WishesClaire x"
867,"Hi all,I am planning on moving to another state sometime next year. The only real obstacle I am worried about is my daughter's father (my ex husband) attempting to stop me from leaving the state with her. I have not yet told him of my intentions to relocate since i do not want him harassing me via phone or just becoming belligerent.Our marriage was a violent one and even after I had left him he still tried to control my life. She loves her father but I think she and I need a fresh start and to seek out better opportunities. Things are not so great where we live now and I do not want her to grow up in this environment.So last night, to seek comfort, I asked the yi ""is he going to stop me from taking my daughter to 'X'?"" and received 40.2.5>45 as my answer.This seems like a really great response not only because it indicates removing barriers and gaining freedom, but it is also seems to describe the need for breaking free from this situation my daughter and i are in.Am I reading this correctly? The relating hexagram 45 is not too clear to me as how it fits in with the primary hexagram and lines. All feedback is appreciated.Namaste"

Really apply myself ...49 (unchanging)Then I asked:How would the Sage guide me into this change/reinvention for work?16.1 > 51Overall, things feel ""slow"" for me (regarding work). I changed agencies (I sell insurance), and it seems to be a slow rebuild. I feel like I am planting a whole lot of seeds, but not doing a whole lot of harvest So, I am looking at future commissions (or lack there of).My take from the hexagrams would be this could be quite transforming for self (49), expect change .. but in an unexpected way.And allowing the enthusiasm to build from within.  16 is about the thunder coming from within (earth) and then turning into 51 (thunder/thunder).  I almost wonder if a new opportunity is going to present itself something job-wise, either within my current career of something out of the blue ..What is everyone's take on this?Thank you in advance for your wisdom & insight -Beth"

I guess I'm actively trying to find out how I shoud proceed in regads to my life and my abilities, that are very much dormant right now. I talked to one person and he gave me an interesting advice. It sounded vey encouraging, though my hopes were shatterd many times, so I'm not sure I should become hopeful yet again and re-experience a huge dissappointment and pain later. My  question about how beneficial would it be for me to follow his advice produced 42, line 3 and 5 changing to 22.

874,"Hello everyone Like so many novices here, I am uncertain of how to interpret a response and would very much appreciate comments from wiser, more experienced heads than mine. I asked: What will be the effect on my business if I buy, practice, and apply a $400 self-study course? The sales copy is so persuasively written that it could sell a torch to a person with his hair on fire, so I'm not sure whether to interpret the answer to mean that I'm just being cleverly courted and have fallen under the spell of this wooing, but that the overall outlook is for a small success in the end. (I note that Bradford's interpretation of 31.5 is ""purpose is trivial"" -- not exactly a call to action.)  Wilhelm seems more encouraging, and Karcher seems to say go for it in a big way.  62, though, seems to be caution against spending the money -- or is it just saying that the return on my investment will be ""exceedingly small""? On the other hand, the hexagrams both seem to say the effort would be worth while, though, so I am unsure how to proceed. There is a 30-day free trial period, full refund guaranteed, so I suppose it's worth a shot in either case. Any observations would be gladly received! Thanks to all. Trilby"

Couple days after that it subsided, I'm not bombarded by the information anywhere I go, but I became less accurate and it takes me more effort now.

878,"Hello everyone,So yesterday I decided to cast a hexagram in the morning asking ""What should I expect from the day?"" and received 49 Radical Change 1.2 changing to 28 Exceeding. Later that night, I got a call from x saying she missed me and wanted to see me. She ended up coming over, and even though nothing really happened, she still wanted be to hold her through the night, which meant a lot to both of us really. It seems as though she is still emotionally unstable, but I am willing to stick this out for the long haul. I think line one reflects that in saying I need to restrain myself from pushing things, and that line 2 represents not that I need to act now, but rather do not miss my chance to act when it arrives.Anyways, I cast another one this morning asking how yesterday would affect my connection with this person and received 24.4. After reading in to this line it seems to correlate to the situation a lot. It speaks of a man being around inferior people but being connected with a good friend. We just had a talk about how the people I hang around with have a lot of bearing on the directions I take in my life. I can't lie, I'm a party kid, and I like to have a good time. For the most part, I've never really gotten in any trouble over it, but it is indeed a character flaw as I am beginning to see. It's hard to seperate from that kind of lifestyle, but if you care about someone enough it is possible to change. Could 24.4 indicate me being the one returning alone? Turning away from my current lifestyle in order pursue something better?Any insight would be awesome as I am not sure how 51 plays in to this casting. Hope to hear from you all, thanks :]"

880,"In a recent question to the oracle, I believe it let me down both in the advice it gave me and in the prediction it made. Yes, I realize my interpretation could have been off; and I also realize that you can't always depend on the Oracle as a perfect fortune-teller -- especially if one isn't adept at interpreting it.

X made some overtures to rebond and I made some back, but timing hasn't yet returned us 100%-- our schedules have been incredibly busy. Yet our supporting each other, even in busy times, is something great about our union. (I wonder if this is a part of the great good fortune of the line.)I have been reading about 42.1 and have gleaned: great good fortune from selflessness and achieving a greater good. Setting an example. Contemplating divine laws to influence good. The ideas are about spiritual laws-- about achieving something great from help on high.

The same day I asked a question 'What does X want from me?""  and got 54. :-( After reading few interpretations and threads on this site - I think I got myself confused as I could not decide if the answer was he wants to control/manipulate me or simply for me take a back seat and let him take the lead in the relationship.  So I asked Yi to clarify hex 54 I received to my question what X wants from me.  In reply, I got 27.2.4.6>54 (IChing is simply amazing).  Either way it is not looking like a 'healthy' situation.

890,"Just for giggles, I asked the IC today, ""Will I marry Terry?""  Yeah, I know, I've asked that already, but thought I'd check in to see what potentially new insights I could get from that question today.  I take the 44.4 > 57 to mean that Terry has put up walls and pretty much locked up his heart from any potential to love.  I also saw interpretations of this line that said the person did not find you of any importance in their lives.  Ugh.  I hope that the timing of 44.4 means this is now passing.The 57 part of it I take it to mean that it will be a gradual process, nothing that's fast between us.  I interpret it as if one was giving in or submitting to fate and allowing it to gradually unfold.  Hmm, could that be the IC telling me once more to chill out and let things happen as it should be?  (As in, if it's meant to be it will and if it isn't, it won't!)I am hopeful that things will start to turn around for us, as the time frame for 57 should be next month....but then again, knowing this stubborn man, it might not...sigh...Thanks for your input!

892,"Hello to all IChingers,Recently my son left his motorbike in the care of someone he trusted to look after it. He accidentally left the key in it and the person rode the bike and used all the fuel. My son let it go saying it was his fault for leaving the key in it. However, when he left the next time he took the key with him and was assured the bike wld be chained up with lock and key. My son then unexpectedly went and picked the bike up to ride it elsewhere and soon found that the wires has been cut amongst other things so that his friend cld ride it. Anyway long story short there is a fair bit of damage to the engine of the bike now and is in need of up to $200 worth of repairs. The bike is only an 07/08 model and my son was hoping to sell it so he could get another one as he has pretty well outgrown this one as he is still a growing teenager but clearly go no longer get what it is worth with the damage that has been caused as well as being devastated that someone wld do this to his property.We have tried to be nice about it asking the parents to pay for the damage. The first time a call was made the father said he wld sort it with his son and pay for it.

893,"I have suffered from shyness my whole life, not the obvious stammering trembling sort, but the brand which after initial pleasantries leaves my mind blank & the acquaintance I'm talking to either bored or nervous in response.  I asked the Yi, 'How do I get over my Shyness?' and received 7.6 in response.Karcher reads 'Lay out the city & receive the dwellers.'  Host a party??  Or make myself more available/visible & then people will come to me (receive the dwellers)?  Karcher also says 'You have succeeded in more ways than one... use all your powers to create a beautiful place. Don't simply adapt. Though you must disturb things have no fear.'  Perhaps a mandate to do self-improvement (creating an inner 'beautiful place' and 'disturbing things')?  An older post describing 7.6 as being about creating and sustaining a world that nourishes us.  To create a world that nourishes me, & in turn nourishes others, is the point of my wanting to get over the awkwardness that comes after chitchat runs dry.  The changing line seems to be describing why I want to get over this block, rather than advice on how to go about this.  Slap me for being impatient with the Yi -- that must be the 4 relating...Thank you in advance for any advice"
894,"I have been troubled that I have only one source of the I Ching to work with at the moment, and that consultations using it may be misinterpreted or somehow corrupted through problems with the text.So I asked. Does my edition of Legge allow the oracle to speak accurately through it?I got 62 .4 changing to 15.Any thoughts on this?"
895,"Hey All ! Here is another puzzle of my life that I suddenly start to think about. Since my high schoo years I sometimes when talking over the phone or daydreaming write some nonsense or draw something on the piece of paper. For some reason I always write word or name ""mark"" I do not know any marks in my life. So I asked who is mark and 38, line 5 came up, with the resulting hex 10? My ancestor? I do not any Marks in my family...-CC"

898,"Hi Everyone!Much love and respect, hope all is well!Asked some questions this morning and I was wondering if anyone could help me interpret the answers.Still funemployed (and LOVING IT now, totally cheerful about the future), but during this lull, I have been getting responses regarding freelance writing gigs (local newspapers, websites, etc.). Also, some literary magazine contests I entered months back should be revealing the results soon.So, I asked the Yi a few questions today:1) What is the likelihood of something fortunate happening within the next few weeks related to my writing? I got 5.2 to 63.This is interesting. Gossip? Why would there be gossip going on in line 2? Hexagram 63 suggests a goal will be attained, regardless of the talk. But, who's talking?2) Why would the event/situation attract gossip? 20 unchanging.Lots of thought. Being watched. Watching. Whenever I get this hexagram it seems like the Yi is directing me to think about what I'm asking. But maybe it has more meaning in relation to this question.3) What is the likelihood of this event/situation being related to getting published?17.3.6 to 13Now THIS is an interesting answer. Hexagram 17 suggests finding a leader, school of thought, whatever, and adapting to it. Line 3 is all about letting go of the past and embracing wise leadership, I think. Line 6: getting into the hall of sages on the western mountain, getting involved with the royal family. And then 13 finding ultimate communion.What do you guys think about these answers? Can't seem to connect it all, what am I missing? As always, thank you!!! Can't wait to hear from you Last edited: Jul 24, 2010"

900,"Hi its HebeI was very impressed with a horse healer who helped us over the weekend and he sensed my interest in his work.  When I confirmed this he suggested I look at 2 courses he was offering with his school - one a a 2 part short equine massage course and secondly a year's part-time course on natural healing for horses and dogs.  As it took my interest so much I thought well maybe that might offer me a new direction.  When I asked about the short course and what the outcome would be if I branched out with this I got hexagram 11.  Inspired I asked sincerely about doing the longer course and got 23 with lines 3 and 5.  I think I understand it correctly in telling me to hold off and not try to fill the void too quickly with a new direction.  Yes, go ahead with the equine massage but although I was not so sure about the line 5 as this suggested a possibility of 'nothing will not benefit from this' - Stephen Karcher.  But in my last thread I remember being advised to really look deeply at the hexagram first.  ' It will not bring you profit to have a plan or direction' stephen karcher again.  General 'feeling' is to hold off at this point.Would you agree?"
901,"Hey there everyone, hope you can take the time to help me unravel this situation. I recently consulted the I Ching randomly about what would happen that night, or what I could look forward to. I got Increase to a Decrease, whose underlying nuclear hexagram is Stripping Away changing to Returning for those who are interested. Anyways, I got a random call from someone I'd been waiting to hear from.Even though she started being distant out of nowhere a couple weeks ago, when she called it was like we never stopped talking. Part of me just feels lead on, but there is sincerity in her words. She said she felt like I was the only person who would never hurt her, and that indeed does mean a lot to me.But anyways haha, I asked 2 questions. First I asked what does she see in me, and I got 26 Great Potential unchanging which is a fairly good sign. However she has given me reasons to be wary of pursuing her as it didn't work in the past. Then again at the time she had a boyfriend, but they broke up recently, which was part of our small falling out.I don't know whether she really sees something in me or is just telling me what I want to hear you know? So I asked why does she say she misses me even though it doesn't feel like it and got 24 2.3.6 Returning changing to 26 Great Potential. Is this a sign that my pursuit is necessary to make things right?Thanks for any help in advance!"
902,"Hey guys!  Thanks for all your support and input so far. I've been thinking lately about the irony of the situation. A person who can see and know stuff about others have hard time helping herself. It pisses me off.  Not only I have hard time figuring my own life out, I also have problem undrstanding Yi. For instance, when asked how can I get what I want, a pretty generic question that refers to multiple areas of my life, got 60, line 6 changing to 61. Stumped as usual. Thanks!-CC"

906,"Dear forum,this is my first post so please forgive me if i make silly questions.I have a weird relationship with a guy I like very very much. He suffers from depression so it's not always easy. Physical and mental connection are there and strong ... we never talk about feelings though ... he just said he cares very much about me ... well better than nothing. The problem is that sometimes puf, he disappears, and not only from me bt from mutual friends and life in general. I know it is related to the illness but it is sometimes difficult for me. I know the potential is there ... and when he is well he is my ideal man, caring supportive funny generous ... anyhow i asked the future of the relationship and I got 14 to 37 ... is it as good as it sounds?now i asked how do i make what we have a stable love relationship and i got 35.3.5 to 33.

909,"Hi,I was wondering if anyone could help me with these readings. I am currently looking for a job - teaching for a year in either China or South Korea. I am applying for jobs in both countries but realise I need to focus - figure out where I want to be. Or, if that's not possible, the best place for me in the long run - I feel I need conviction now.I asked the I ching for a general reading on China: 27; South Korea: 50.Parallel readings in the sense that they both talk of food - in China needing it, in South Korea getting it? hmm..I am due for an interview with a primary school in Suzhou. China tomorrow - I asked for a reading of this prospect: 13.3,4 > 42I think this could be reflecting my slight distrust of chinese schools. We weren't treated very well by the school I worked at before and I previously accepted a job which I had to cancel after reading poor reviews... But in China I think there are less hours and more holidays which would be good for doing other work...Committing to South Korea14.5,6 > 43I need to decide in order to obtain something valuable here? Knock on doors more loundly? It is more competitive in SK (higher wage, standard of living, etc.)I then asked what will happen if I return to China? Hex 49Could be suggesting a good change, but in a previous reading it transpired that what I was asking about was overthrown...What if I make a new start in South Korea? 8.2 > 29Hmm... social issues? I do actually know a few people there at the mo. So that's a good thing, but I do have that slight fear of commitment (as reflected by hex 29) I suppose I have that vague insecurity of gah they've met me and we've got on but if they get to know me more... I guess I am leaning towards South Korea - heard good things about it and had a fab holiday there with a good friend (who won't be there when I go though but I met some of her friends and she may return next year), but then I've started learning Chinese and felt I'd like to continue, and while I was there that I defs would return, there's places I never got to see that I'd like to... And the I ching connection, but if you take a look at the korean flag there are the 4 trigrams.... In light of these readings what do you see in my indecision?Thanks for any interpretations:bows:"
910,"Hello everyone. I'd appreciate some help with an interpretation if I may. I should preface this by stating that I may have fashioned my query in an incorrect manner. I asked a yes/no question and I'm not sure how to interpret.Several months ago I made a friend with whom I became intimate. As time went by we discovered that we had an awful lot in common as far as interests and perceptions. We used to talk, text and email daily. That seemed to stop rather suddenly on his end several weeks ago. When I questioned him about it he simply said that he had been incredibly busy with some family matters, etc., and apologized. However, it doesn't seem that much has changed.I asked, ""Is it best for me to give up on a friendship with X?""The answer I recieved was hexagram 46, with a changing yang line in the second place, becoming hexagram 15. I sought clarification, but received hexagram 4, no changing lines. Uh-oh!  So the I Ching is telling me that I have received an answer and need to deal with that instead of trying further.Try as I might I can't place the answer in context. Primarily because of the way I formed the question. Basically I can't perceive whether pushing upward means I should take steps to encourage the friendship or to disassociate myself from it.Would someone be so kind as to give me a bit of guidance from an objective standpoint here?Thanks!"
911,"Howdy.  Well,  several months ago some friends of mine attended a women's group.  I wasn't able to attend because I had to work that particular day.  They said it was an especially good meeting, that a metaphysician was present and she seemed very impressive.  I am insterested in a consultation with a metaphysician, so I was able to get the lady's contatct info.  She and I emailed each other a few times, then everything with that was put on the backburner for me.  I've recently been thinking about contacting her again, so I thought I would ask the oracle its take on things.  I asked: What do I need to know about C?""   I received Hex 12 with lines 1, 3, and 6 changing to Hex 49.  Well, Standstill moving to Revolution.    I know that there are a few different ways of interpreting this.  I'm thinking that with danger being something mentioned in Hex 12 and two people fighting each other in Hex 49 that it could mean that C could be dangerous for me to associate with.  Or with Hex 49 being about self transformation that C could be the very person who could give me some help in that direction.   Also, the oracle could be saying that I'm seeking help with internal transformation, but that if I seek out C for the help all I will find is that I'm going nowhere with her (Hex 12).   Well, I'm just not sure what the oracle is telling me with this one."

914,"In the early 1980s I acquired (I cant remember how) a book called the I Ching The book of Changes, a translation by a Mr James Legge. Its old - first published in 1899 I think.Mines an orange paperback, published by Dover. I think its from the 70s.Today for the first time, I took it down, and began to use it, as opposed to just looking at it, as I had done on and off for years, as I had no way (in the book itself) of ""activating"" it. This led me to this website. This website provided the interface, the voice for the first time, for my copy of Legges translation. The time had come, after 27 years. It was like having an ancient piece of high technology, and finally figuring out where the on switch was. ( The Legge is purely a translation, no overview and explaination of the mechanics of its use)A half an hour or so later, just having got my head round the basic basic basics, I asked my first questions.Maybe certain conjunctions have come together, but today I began to communicate with them, it she, or he.I have asked 4 or 5 questions ( I dont want to tire/bore ""it"") and I got some very powerful, complex and very meaningful responses.I am figuring out how to communicate them to you, I will try to replicate the method that I have seen here. I am writing down and keeping each question, and the responding Hexagram(s).

917,"Hi everyone, this is my first visit here although the I ching has been important in my life for about 10 years.I'm going through a huge period of change and upheaval.  After 25 years in the UK, and a very turbulent 12 months, I am moving back to Australia to be near to my extended family and friends.  Terminal illness in my relatively young and nearest sibling and offspring leaving home to go there to live have triggered these changes which have also meant as of yesterday that someone I had met recently and was very close to decided my ship was not his and decided to jump.  Not suprisingly I've had Hexagram 51 a few times!Now though I have to make a decision about my lovely Chocolate Lab who has been my closest companion through various storms for 5 years.  I put a prayer up into the cosmos, that if she were meant to stay here where she is happy and has lovely beaches to run on, then the right home would materialise, and so it did.  She has been with a really nice family for 4 months and its been extremely hard being without her.  They have offered her a permanent home.  She is now for a few weeks though with me again, keeping me company and bringing much happiness.  My elder son thinks I should take her with me to Oz, as she keeps me in a good place psychologically speaking, but I am not sure that it is fair of me to put her through all the changes when I'm not sure what sort of life I will be able to give her there.  I will probably have to work full time, might she get in the way of that, equally does she make sure I can't overdo it?  When I asked I got Hexagram 30.

918,"Hi all,I decided to use a “tool” in order to achieve something. There are pros and cons but generally it is considered an efficient tool. Anyway, after thinking a lot about it , and be give some reassuring reading about using it , decided to say yes. Today I asked Yi “what do I need to know about using that tool” and got 34 unchanging. Funny, because this tool is used to enhance power and 34 is talking about power, so at a first glance seems good. The reason I asked Yi, is because I’m exploring my , lets say, second thoughts whether this tool can be efficient and effective, and also about my decision to use it.  I read Yi’s answer as yes to all but I wonder if my need for affirmation makes me lose another aspect of this reading. of course i see a kind of warning, or just an advice to be mindful while using it, but i guess there is not something really alarming in that reading, yes ? So , how would you read it ?Thanks in advance Maria"

This actually gave me the feeling of not to tell them or at least to be very strong inside as they would indeed have strong emotions which I could then take on board.  That it would change relations - of course it would, how they relate to my husband & to me.  So, in view of that, maybe its not quite the right time yet.  Would you agree on my interpretation?

930,"Hello Everyone,How's it going?! I hope July is treating you well!!I'm back home in L.A. after moving from London (been here for a month). LOVING it, friends and fam, it's been amazing!Of course, the job hunt is gruelling. It's difficult to find work. Languishing in idleness, I've been blowing up the I Ching, trying to put things in perspective, get out of my head and figure out what's going on regarding my professional future.Throughout my multiple casting sessions, I've been receiving one hexagram in particular: 56 Traveling. Here are some questions along with the answers I received that include this hexagram:What do I need to know about my job hunt right now? 52.4 to 56.How will my job search unfold this month? 15.4.6 to 56.What is the likelihood that I'll actually be working at a job this August? 56 unchanging.I really don't get this hexagram right now for some reason. In the past, I always got 56 when I cast a reading in London and I took it very literally, 'cause I was a foreigner there. I guess my problem is that I generally interpret 56 literally ALL the time. I know I'm traveling right now in two very real senses: 1) I've traveled back to L.A. and although it's home, I'm still experiencing readjustment culture shock 2) I'm traveling around looking for jobs. What's worrying me is the fact that the I Ching may be advising me to travel to another city AGAIN? I can't do that though! It's impossible! I'm broke and I'm sick of jetsetting around the world trying to find myself! I'm found and I'm ready to re-establish my life in L.A. permanently. So what does hexa 56 MEAN?! *sigh*, it's driving me a bit nutty.Other Q&As about the job hunt have been really supportive and, dare I say it, kind of auspicious sounding. Looking for writing jobs, not just editorial work too... So could hexagram 56 indicate traveling into a ""new"" industry?Gosh, OK, gonna stop now. Thank you so much for listening! Would absolutely RELISH your opinions. Have a great day!Last edited: Jul 15, 2010"
931,"Hey all! I had yet another channeling session, and my medium old me I have some sort of healing abilities for myself and others. I'm still struggling with the medschool ideas. I guess I do not trust myself, and her comment came as a surprise for me. I do no feel any healing abilities in me, I thought if I had them i would have known about them by now.My question about my healing abilities gave me 2, lines 1, 2 and 4 with 54 as a result. That does not seem to indicate I have any. Was this medium wrong then? She even tried to do a self-healing session with me, not sure if it worked. All this sound like an absurd to me. She talked about my past lives, 3 of them, and she told me the themes of my current life are magic, sexuality and healing ( of self and others)....WeirdThanks-CC"
932,"Howdy all.  A little while back a psychic told me that I would meet a romantic interest through an ""indirect work connection"".  I've been thinking about what she's told me lately, and that has led me to ask the oracle about things.  I asked: What do I need to know about the indirect work connection?   I received Hex 26.2.3 changing to Hex 27.  I know Hex 27 is about nourishment, but I really don't know much about Hex 26.  This is another reading that's a little hard for me to understand."
933,"A friend of mine stop talking to me altogether and won't talk to me even after I apologized to her multiple times for not being able to keep in contact.  I asked the I-Ching ""Is my friend gone forever?"" and the I-Ching gave me hexagram 50.2.5.6 and that changed into 31.  I interpreted this as in she's never coming back and that it will bring me spiritual success.  Hexagram says something about attraction and how everything that is beautiful and innocent isn't always as it seems.  So is this telling me to watch out for her and let go?I had also asked the I-Ching a question pertaining to the same girl earlier which was ""Is it safe to assume I will not have to deal with her again?"" and the I-Ching casted 9.1.2 and changed into 53.  Hexagram 9.1.2 says something about the subject return to his proper course and innate desires I think and 53 says something about the subject attending the maiden's marriage?  So I am really confused.  Can someone clear up what these hexagrams mean in relation to my situation?  Your soul will be blessed. Thank You"

938,"It's regarding the place where I live.  ""They"" in question are one of my sisters and her son.  She owns the place.  I told a little about my nephew in another thread about the disappearance of a cat, and whether he played a role.  (I still don't know).A few months ago, her son moved in to a shack nextdoor on the property.  Now she is here for hours everyday doing yard work, and they both are definitely taking over the place in a very blatant way.  They barge into the house without knocking, etc.  They have gotten increasingly high-handed, and they do all kinds of things without asking or even warning us.  And I see them talking intently to eachother about something that they don't let me in on.  23, 3rd changing line to 52.  Looks ominous!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit to add:I live in the house with my mother. She has a life estate, which means my mother is basically the owner until she dies, and has ""the right to quiet enjoyment"". Mom allowed me to live with her, but nobody ever asked her if the young man could move in...he just moved on in. My sister and her son are absolutely not respecting the life estate contract right now, but so far my mom hasn't protested. I feel that I have very little say in the matter, except to stand up for my mom's rights. But nobody has really discussed anything openly. There seems to be a lot of secrecy and passive agressiveness. I hesitate to post too much details on the internet, but it is relevant to my question.Last edited: Jul 15, 2010"
939,"Instead of asking for your help, I'd just like to share a wonderful clear answer.  On tuesday I was stung twice on my boob by a wasp from a nest that had been disturbed.  To begin with it wasn't too bad but yesterday they got worse and today I felt really grotty & the stings had gone all hard - really painful.  Having tried pirriton yesterday and felt dreadful on it I decided against it today.  But the pain was so bad!  Might even have been 3 stings as they kind of blur into each other.  Anyway I thought perhaps I should persist with the perriton, but couldn't do it.  Tried plantain poltice etc .  I asked the I Ching about it as I was curious if there were any insights into this.  I got 25:5 and when I read Stephen Karcher and Wiki Wing it was just so accurate!  Waning moon.  Disentagling from an unexpected affliction.  If you don't use medicine you will soon rejoice.  This does not allow testing things.  You are suffering from sickness anger or negative emotion.  Though you may be in pain, don't treat it as a medical or literal problem.  See it imaginatively and spiritually.  It will soon clear up and you will have cause to rejoice.Out with the Perriton and in with the journal!  Lots of insights and valuable thoughts esp with 25 and then onto 21 relating hexagram.  After all my 'help' threads I'm glad to be adding something positive which is how I see it.  SMILEY  Hebe"
940,"Was I right doing so?Some weeks ago I asked what the weather here in germany would be like this summer. It was quite cool when I asked, no idea we weer going to have a hot summer.What I got was 34 - 2,5,6  - The power of the Great I thought that the trigramms should give the right idea: Heaven and thunder.Now it is hot, at times even extremely hot - we had 38 degrees last weekend .And we've had a number of thunderstorms, some of which were really destructive.So I'd say the prediction has turned out to be true.But was it ok to ask the I Ching about a topic that did not really involve myself?[Regards,M."

945,"There is (was) a sickly old black cat that hung around the property where I live.  She was only half-tame, but we fed her on the front porch.  We also have a pet cat that is allowed in the house.  My nephew moved in a few months ago, into a shack on the property.  He has made it clear how much he dislikes the black cat, calling it a ""plague cat"" that he says will spread disease, and will cause our pet dog to be a ""plague dog"".  He doesn't treat our pet cat very kindly, and the pet cat now avoids him.  But he especially complained about the black cat.  The black cat has been missing for 4 days, and we suspect the nephew was involved.  I asked, ""What happened to the black cat?""  20, changing lines 3 & 6 To me, the answer seems only to say that whatever happened was for the best.

947,"HelloI have recently begun a temporary job in a big hospital. It is supposed to last until end of august at best. But some says that when you begin working in this hospital, you never leave. And the service where I am working is in restructuration, and no one knows atm what will happen with this position I am occupying right now. So I asked, how will my job evolve and got 19,2,5 -> 3This seems to be quite positive for me. But I am unable to determine if this only about what will happen to me in the present temporary job (which will be finished end of august) or if it describes a bigger picture. Reaching an end in the eighth month means a pitfall. This last sentence makes me think that the job will last until august and nothing after that except maybe (I hope so) a satisfied boss which will open new possibilities for me in this hospital (other temporary job?).Insights on this would be greatly appreciated "
948,"Hello all,I need some objective insight into hexagram 43 no changing lines.  I have had a few rough years culminating in this year being a real bear; I had a disgruntled fellow employee steal items and money that I was responsible for along with sabotaging my computer and various other operations and I was hit by a car. All along I have been doing my intentions for a happy, healthy, wealthy, safe and fulfilling life, obviously to no avail.  When I ask the iching if my intentions will work it gives me seemingly encouraging answers but nothing manifests.  Then when I ask again I get a negative answer.  After getting a negative answer from a rune casting, obstruction, loss, etc., I just thought ""This is it for me.  Things will never get better, I will just go on having negative things happen to me, I will just get older and worse off without any help, there is no point in even thinking that my life will improve.""  It was like a dash of cold water.  After a while, I asked the Iching ""Really, what can I do to have a good life!""  I got hexagram 43 no changing lines.     I didn't understand if it meant I should eliminate the false hopes or thinking nothing is going to work, so the next day I tried something I had read about; thinking of a question you want answered with your eyes closed and when you open your eyes the first thing you focus on is the answer.  I was on the bus and when I opened my eyes I saw the reflection in the window of a woman talking on the phone.  I didn't see any answer in that until I noticed she was standing, even though there were many empty seats, even one right beside her.  Ok, so I should stand even though it isn't comfortable or even unneccessary, but should I stand for something or against something?     I didn't want to ask that question because I would be confused as to if it was for or against, so I asked ""Why do I need to stand up?"" and I got 47.2.5 changing to 16.  Oppression I understand, I have gotten that one a lot, but what is it that is oppressing me?        I have had a lot of little negative things happening to me in addition to the big ones that add up to make me feel like I am just under a dark cloud, but I keep doing my positive intentions.  However, it seems that every time I do my intentions, more negative things happen.  I've meditated on loving myself and filling myself with light to offset any hidden self sabotage, but apparently that isn't working.  Just some insight, is the iching saying I should stand for or against something, what is oppressing me and what is it telling me to do for a positive outcome."
949,"Hi folks Anyone have experience with 3.4>17?I read it as ready to proceed with an alliance, but following the signs of the times and moving with the creative process (h17). I also saw something about line 4 as ""needing help"" to get to the union. Does the other party need help from me or do I?  (Thus I'm here)Lise says of line 4:   ""Like driving a team of horses proposing marriage. To proceed is  auspicious. There will be harvest. If you want something, then go for it!

Its success depends on your motivation, dedication, all the powers you yourself put into it.""My query was about what my partner wants from me right now (we took a break for a bit).

950,"Hello.  I asked the I Ching ""What will make me more attractive to the opposite sex?"" and I received Hexagram 56 lines 1 and 5 changing to 13.  Definitely looks like I need a change of location with 56 showing up.  Is the IC saying that I need to move and make new friends?  Or is the IC saying that I need to just travel more, maybe with a friend?  I did post a question the other day about moving, but the IC seems to be saying that a move is something that I'm not ready for just yet (got 62 changing to 13).  So it wouldn't make much sense if the IC is saying a move is indeed a good idea, unless it's saying the move will be a good idea when I'm ready for it, which isn't just yet."
951,"I have a property to view tomorrow night, Tuesday, as a potential rental home [for which I am desperate] that has been described as ""idyllic.""  This time I want something for the long term -- not just a quick fix.  At the same time, on Thursday, I have a final interview for a job opportunity -- an extraordinary one -- that would take me out of the country altogether, leaving no housing problem to consider.  The timing of these is a bit backwards perhaps, since I can't answer on the house until potential for the job is known, and thinking maybe I could eliminate this house, if it's not a good idea, I've asked the Yi ""Is this house the house for me?""  Reply:  Hex 18.6 changing to Hex 46. Which says I should not be doing business with king and lords but paying attention to what feeds my inner being?  And that could be interpreted a lot of ways, including that the house in an out of the way locale might feed the spirit -- or that the job of all time might do that.  Confusion continues.  And, by the way, for Willow Fox, this house is right there on the flowing water, a stream, as foretold.  However, the flat I'd have if I take this job is overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, so no help there either in differentiating what to keep and what to eliminate.Last edited: Jul 12, 2010"

953,"Hi all!Please forgive me, as I asked a handful of questions to the IC about this ""on again""/ ""off again"" relationship with Terry that I'd like to get your take on.  It's just that we're kinda ""on"" right now, but maybe not really, and it makes things difficult to understand exactly where I stand.  Thank goodness for the IC to keep me balanced, as I think just the emotionality of it all could send even the most centered individual into a tailspin.  Argh!  Men!Okay, here goes....I asked Jesed's diagnostics to start:General Diagnosis of the Relationship  64.3 > 50My Position in the Relationship  52.3.6 > 2Terry's Position in the Relationship  61.6 > 60Then added these questions:What is the Ultimate Outcome of this Relationship?  24 UnchangingDoes my Future Involve Being Married to Terry?  9 UnchangingHere's my take on things....the general diagnosis (64.3 > 50) says that I need to be patient and look at the bigger picture.  The time of transition for us into a more stable union has not yet happened, but it is near.My position (52.3.6 > 2) is one of wanting physical closeness with Terry.  The sexual element is in this casting, which I agree with wholeheartedly, but I think it's really telling me to focus more on not pushing Terry.  I need to chill out, find peace within and just wait for things to unfold as they will.Terry's position (61.6 > 60) is that of words, but not actions...or then again, this could be the time he's receiving a ""wake up call"" about relationships overall.  His rigid ideas are being tested against his inner truth and he's realizing they don't match.  Terry was hurt badly by his ex-wife (she cheated on him, remarried the 'other man' and now has a young child by him now), so I think this hex is telling us he's being forced to deal with his past hurts and move on.  I had a manicure recently, and the tech held my hand up and said, ""See these?  They're all fingers, right?  Each one looks different and has a different purpose.  Just like women.  You may all be women, but each of you are totally different.  He needs to learn that you aren't going to be just like his ex-wife.""  The technician shook his head in disgust.  Who knew I'd find wisdom in a nail salon?  :bows:I think the ""ultimate outcome"" question (24 Unchanging) is telling me to hang on.  Things will turn around for the better, and we'll be on the path together once again.And the last question about being Mrs. Terry someday (9 Unchanging), I think it's telling me to chill out again.  I feel trapped, blocked, unable to progress in the current situation.  It's like I'm stuck and not ever getting anywhere, and the IC just patted me on the head and said, ""Patience, child, patience.  It will get better.""  I really appreciate your take on these castings.  I am still trying to focus on other areas of my life that need attention, like my business, my health and preparing for that 5k.  (Yes, I'm running now six days a week!  I can do a two mile without too much issue at this point.)  However, it's the loneliness and the confusion brought about by Terry that has me rattled here.  Thanks again for taking the time to help!"
954,"I have been an unemployed teacher for over a year now.  I apply for every position that becomes available in my county and have recently branched out to a neighboring county but cant seem to make headway.  I have worked 2 years in different schools, actually in different states, teaching English to 8th and 9th grade.  I asked:What do I need to do to secure a teaching position? 21 unchangingIve been using Lise a lot lately.  I used to use numerous resources, but discovered that I just ended up with confusing and sometimes conflicting responses, so I narrowed it down to looking at Lise and occasionally Wilhelm and then trying to meditate on the response to see how it answers the question.  I also look up previous discussions in the shared readings section here.  21 on Lises talks about becoming a Shaman, which I couldnt make sense of with my question, but a previous discussion of 21 here talked about judgement being mistranslated and maybe being closer to investigation.  It made me wonder if 21 is pehaps about finding the root of the problem, figuring out what you need to bite through to succeed.  Not sure if thats what it meant, but thought it might be a good question anyway, so asked:Why am I having such a problem getting hired as a teacher? 35.4I hate this line.  There is so much disagreement on what it might mean, and it rarely makes sense to me, but looking at Lises translation, "" Knowing a lot of things, but all just a little. Doing many things but not finishing one. Then there will never be any advance.  Everything – a thing, a relation, your life – needs completion. A half-built house is no house, a half-lived life is no life"" it seems to say something about knowing a little about a lot of different things and needing to focus on maybe being an expert in one subject instead.  Not sure how that relates as I do specialize in English 7-12, though I am now trying to add a Science endorsement because I thought I would have more of a chance of getting hired if I could offer more than one subject, and Science teachers are in great demand.  Could it just be referring to lack of experience in this case?  Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.  I desparately need a job as my unemployment is going to run out soon.

Interesting though, since some combination of these teams will have to face off in the early rounds (Ivory Coast meets Brazil next week, and likely Spain if they make it to the next round) and it's possible that Spain and Brazil will play in the final. I'd say the readings favor Spain over Brazil, and that Ivory Coast will do better than expected...

When the conqueror entered the city he was met by the earl of Zheng, stripped to the waist like a labourer and leading a sheep – the same idiom is used for this oracle – as a sign that he would pledge fealty in return for mercy.

I am quite afraid of getting hurt , having not so long ago escaped a very unhappy relationship.:bows:"
970,"Hello.  I asked the question ""Will I move from my parents' home within the next five years"" and received hexagram 62 with lines 1, 5, and 6 changing to 13.  After doing some research on 62, I think the IC is saying that moving out is feasible but only if done in a ""small way"".  It can't be a big move out of town or out of state, that I have to stay close to the nest.  It seems to be saying that I really need to pay attention to small details, so I need to get my ducks in a row before setting out.  Maybe 13 is about still keeping in contact with my parents, trying to get along with them.  Or maybe 13 might be talking about the need to have a roommate.  What do you guys think?"
971,"Hi,This is my situation. I have moved 7 times in the past 4 years and have finally found an ideal situation affordable for me and my son and nurturing, joyous place to live.I live in a caravan park renting a small 2 bedroom cottage off my friend. Before I cld actually move in I had to officially sign a form with the caravan park saying it was only for 100 days. That is now up and they are telling me I have to move. My girlfriend has said she wants me to stay here until at least February next year but hopes I can stay here for longer as she does not retire until another 4 years time. It is beneficial to both her and I, and the caravan park are still getting the rent due to them.My son and I would be devastated if we had to move plus I cannot really afford to  I asked ' what can I expect in regards to my living circumstances over the next week'Hex 24.1.4>16thku as I am near tearsMelissa"
972,"Hi, I am looking for some confirmation on two readings I did. The issue at hand being some problem I am having with a couple of co-workers and I know that the upcoming weeks (this in particular) are going to extremely tough for me. I asked ""How should I handle this situation?"" and received 33.1.3.5-->21under normal circumstances, I would definately take this to me I should just quit and do it cheerfully as in line 5 (even if I have to fake the cheerfulness) because the enemy is right on my tail as in line 1 (this does seem applicable in the situation. I am not sure about line 3, am going to take this as the advice to be kind to these people because somewhere down the line they may be of use to me. The problem is (and certainly the I ching knows this!) There is no way I can leave my job right now, I simply can't. It is not even an option. Given that I asked ""Are you telling me I should quit this job now?"" and received 23.6-->2!Two hexagrams involving quitting (retreating and splitting!) But I am confusing myself over line 6, the fruit still uneaten: does that mean to stay as their is more for me here in this position. Or should I ignore that and focus on the superior man getting the carriage: meaning I should get in a carriage and go?? But I can't do that! I am not sure what to do, any help?!"
973,"There has been quite a bit of speculation lately that the Iraqi dollar - the ""dinar"" - is about to be revaluated. It was first assume that when Vice President Biden made his visit to Iraq last week that this would be when the RV would come. However it did not happen. So I asked the I Ching, ""When will the dinar be revalued?"" The assumption is that when this happens it will create quite a shake up in the world monetary system. I received 40.3 - 32.The hexagrams themselves - Deliverance and Duration are kinda an interesting coupling. 40 sounds as if there is a change but 32 sounds like things stay the same. Further the line, 40.3, sounds like investors getting rich but it causing problems. Rosada"
974,"Hi everyone, I need some help from everyone/anyone on a query that got me stuck, since I'm asking about someone else rather than what I should do.  The question was ""what does she see in me""And I got hexagram 5 lines changing at 1,2,3,5 and secondary hexagram as 2I am a little confused, I guess the answer would be very obvious if my question was ""should i court her"" or ""what should i do to court her"" or is the Yi telling me to wait and try to build on the relationship?5.

975,"Hello,I am stumped about a reading I have received regarding my next steps. I am currently separated from my husband, and am considering taking a position abroad. In order to do that, one of the two of us would need to relocate in order to establish residency for divorce in a no-fault state. Complications are such at the moment that it is not easy for either of us to move. When I asked about whether to sign the contract (have to decide soon) I got 53.4 > 33. When I asked if my husband should move, I got 28.1.4.6 > 9. When I asked what was in both our best interests, I got 28.1.5 > 34.I should also admit that I have difficulty accepting the divorce, even though I realize the relationship is untenable. I feel like I'm getting mixed messages of take action and wait.Any thoughts?Thank you."

977,"Hi - I have apt problem - I'll try to be as thorough as possible (without being overwhelmingly detailed).I asked the I ching about this because: My apartment building has bed bugs - I've already been treated, but may still have issues. I have a new roommate, who may or may not want to stay in this situation - Even though I've talked to them, My landlord won't compell the tenant downstairs to cooperate. ( I haven't spoken to the downstairs tenant - Bed bugs travel Up - so, heads up).This is important because - in dealing with this situation, the whole apt I building must be treated. If it isn't , it means all my (overall) hard work might go to waste. My lease is coming up and I am worried about all of this; My landlord thinks I'm a pain, and my new roommate seems like he is on his last thread. I contacted a lawyer, who said to take serious action by contacting the city - I hope this is enough - I asked the i ching: What do I need to know about my apt situation?  I received: 57Follow up question - what do I need to do to be secure and come out ahead? I received: 35. I take this to mean - I need to take gentle, decisive actions -nothing severe, and gently move this situation towards respect/resolution. Have I missed anything? Can you please help me understand this, if you can?"

979,"I have been trying to work with a woman who is a skilled technician to accomplish a bit of work I am too busy to do myself. So far we have not been able to get the work done after 6 months of failures for various reasons. I am thinking of ending this work relationship and trying to find another way to accomplish this job.

980,"Taking a big step this week, I gave notice on the house I'm in that is for sale.  I'm just recognising that I need to give two month's notice and October will bring the cold again in a very expensive place to heat -- a bill I don't want a second year.  So I gave notice and right away, where there had been no possibilities at all, a couple houses to let have turned up.  One is in a perfect position, seems a perfect size and type of home.  It's been vacated and I've been enquiring what the disposition of the place will be.  It's one of many owned by a large estate property nearby who often uses places for their staff and they aren't available to anybody else for quite a while when that occurs. This one had been let to a person in the wider community, so I'm hoping.  However,  I can't get an answer so far on this house and so I'm preempting the answer by asking the Yi instead:""Will I get this house?""  The reply:  Hex 49 judgement.  Okay, does this mean I'll end up with something I haven't even thought of yet?  Or maybe that my life will change entirely and I won't need that particular house?  If I keep my present job [not the most fulfilling but pays the bills] and I stay in this part of the world [limited social life but I get to be near my family], this house could be the answer to a prayer.  Any thing else is  a gamble [the one other possibility I know of includes great employment, but in a foreign land where I've never been and where I know nobody].  Or maybe there's just a housing option I haven't imagined yet?  In any case, looks like something big is afoot and I have to get my imagination and flexibility in gear."

I'd say that it looks positive and that the Yi is telling me that this is a big step, a transformative experience.Do you think this is the case?  Does it seem positive to you?"
983,"Hi all, a week or so ago I posted about a relationship that wasn't moving.  Not ending...not beginning...just in limbo.  The lines seemed positive. I received subsequent  guidance  from the yi to pull back...give it time, be patient, which I have done.I haven't spoken to him in over a weekThis space from the relationship has been good for me and given me much needed time for inner reflection. I've become less attached to the situation, although I do indeed care deeply for him and wonder  if there is a future for us.  Today I asked: ""What do I need to know about X?""33.6) Retreat31.) WooingI see that 33.6 is about a cheerful retreat.  A ""withdrawal with potential"".  I'm wondering if the Yi is just giving me a picture of the current situation...or should this be a permanent retreat.Despite my attempt at total detachment, I still hope I  that things might get moving.And how does 31 play in to this...if at all...I asked about him, but maybe this is just about me.Thanks!Last edited: May 29, 2008"
984,"My question was: How can I solve the financial challenges of my present?I found it interesting that there were so many changing lines, for a hex that speaks of gradual developing.  Usually when I see a lot of changing lines, that typically speaks (to me) of a lot going on and usually a fairly quickly changing scenerio.What I got from this was: lasting progress is through my gradual progress.

985,"I wanted to tell a bit of a story that happened to be yesterday about 5.6 ... Context: I was pining away for a man that I had started a rather unusual relationship with ... there are profoundly strong bonds between us, but these bond express themselves in rather unusual distant ways.  Neither us like to be away from other for very long, but most of the relationship actualizes online although we live quite close to each other. I am insanely busy ...  Anyhow, something occurred between us, and I decided on stepped back from engaging with this man. BUT, I knew to be still and wait.  So, I did. There was no contact between us for 2 days ... that is ALOT (although writing this, it seems silly) ...So, after a while I used LiSe's coin toss (LOVE that application), and asked ... What is the correct attitude to hold with JN now?  I received 5.6.  LiSe: Above 6: Entering the cave. There are unexpected visitors. Three people come. Respect them. The end is auspicious.The spirit can find what he waits for by shutting itself off from external influences, and by expecting the magical, the unconceivable. Then the miracle can enter, and bring a solution. So if you are at a loss, then just wait. Your mind has many realms you do not even know about.(Changes to hex.9)Wilhelm-Banes: Six at the top means:One falls into the pit.Three uninvited guests arrive.Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a move on one's own part, there's outside intervention. At first one can't be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at first seems strange to us. I also read Rosada's Learning the Hexagram thread on 5, and in particular Line 6.  Hilary made a great comment about waiting then receiving what we weren't waiting for.  As the story goes, I waited as instructed, and I waited as instructed ... and no contact. I pined, and pined.  Nothing.  So to soothe my pain (or fan the flames of pain, not sure which) I started looking through his online page and more broadly his online site.  And, there tucked away was on some page that I never look at (the music page) was a song list with entitled with my initials ... it was the most romantic thing.  The waiting and separation was torture (as per a song) for him as well.   This most romantic song-list started with 2 uninvited songs ... then I gently respected and welcomed these uninvited arrivals ... and then a 3rd song arrived on the list.  I too respected this guest's arrival.  Although I waited and waited, I needed to be open to the unexpected, and welcoming gently and respectfully.  It has not rained yet in this relationship ... these quests however are comforting me. Interesting, today's reading of ""what is the correct attitude to hold with JN now, or today?  And, I received yesterday's resulting hexagram ... 9.  Tending Small Livestock--""When one accepts the slow way in which nature works, one creates the space, where one's true path can unfold.""  (www.yijing.nl ---Thank-you LiSe for all of your insight and wisdom) ...So many have helped me with their stories and knowledge ..."
986,"Hey all!  Thank you for reading yet another post from me.Something so strange is happening here. During my last dialog with Yi ching, my question about a specific healer and her powers to help me produced 42, line 3 moving to 37. I talked to her over the phone and she started chatting  about some weird things and it took my couple minutes to realize that she was actually talking about my life experiences from  the past, very specific ones that I never shared with her. Can I trust her, can she help me? Obviously she seems to have some sort of abilities. She told me there is a man in your field, he is your twin. I do not have any twins. She does Tong Ren and Quntum Touch, and she talked about some other weird ( that is for me things)One more thing, I noticed in the other 2 readings that I posted here: how to get rid of this annoying person and my question about med school both produced 42.3 as well. Why any question I ask talks about this? Or may be it refers to the unfortunate circumstances in my life that  made me re-evalute my life and as a result of this process a) get rid of a person in my life who does not belong here, i.e. unfulfilling relationship b) think hard about my profession and my true calling and c) going to a healer to deal with old stuff. Does my analysis make any sense? It does to me  Am I being encouraged here by I ching? Thanks-CC"
987,"Hello All,For at least 1 year, I've been thinking about moving.

I am still thinking about it and I asked again. What will happen if this Fall I leave X to live in S.?I received 17.1 >45Not easy to interpret, then I thought about my last answer : 26.2 >22. My problem is confidence. I don't have much and like someone wrote in my previous post, I need to ""repair the axelstraps of the cart"" and believe in me. I read a few post about 17.1 and also Karcher's interpretation. I read 17.1 is about a new system of belief . Karcher wrote: "" Leave what you usually do, go out in the world and mingle with others. The way is open. By stepping out of your usual place you will achieve something""Line 1 depicts what I would like to do and maybe the Yi is recommending me to do so. What do you think?

I sent a note of support saying so (we live in different cities). I asked the Yi for advice last week about my proper action and got: 33.4>53 Perhaps retreating is the support to offer here, which takes the burden off my partner to have to ""manage"" our relationship. Seems like a loving retreat to me.I also got 42.5.6>24 about how best to proceed which seems to confirm that offering kindness from the heart without thought of return and keeping away from actions that might be irritating (anything not heartfelt) leads to a return to normalcy.Today asked about the present status of the relationship and got 13.1.5>56 which seems to say truth must be present for a good union at the beginning and we are bound in the heart and will get through difficulties--the question I have is about hex 56--does it mean we are traveling alone for the moment? It's true we are separated by distance. Or that we are not in the same ""fold"" right now? It seems not so united to me...?I also asked: show me X's position in the relationship now and got48.2.4>31 which I took to mean ""the source"" is not useful right now, but is being repaired in the background.

1000,"Hey all! And thank you for reading this post. I also want to thank everyone who answered my posts before. What an amazing website! Here is my dillema, it's been there all my life since I was 16. I did not go to a med school when I wanted. I had no real support, moral or financial at the time. Instead I've choosen an easier path which led me nowhere. I've chosen it hoping I can make a quick buck, which I did, but then I started to hate my job and thinking about something more fulfillng. And I came back to my initial ideas of med school. The bottom line the question about preparing for a med school produced 42.1.3.5 to 52. It would be a really long road for anyone, especially for someone like myself starting the school not in her 20's. This is a very important question for me. 42 sounds very positive to me, but 52 is a stop? It scares the *** out of me. Time, money, amount of study, sleepless nights during residency, what am I thinking? And yet I can not get it out of my head. I think when I'm 60 I'll regret not doing it.  I have no idea where the money will come from? Naively I think it will magically appear once I put myself on the road to med school.  Thanks a  lot!-CCLast edited: Jul 1, 2010"

Later that day, I sent along a few news articles on a professional subject I thought he'd enjoy knowing about.  There was no reply to either of my messages. I just thought, well, too busy, and let it go at that.Today, I passed him walking on a nearby lane, rolled down my car window and thought I'd chat.  He looked excrutiatingly embarrassed and could barely speak, made a few comments and then moved on quickly.I've pondered this all day, wondering if I just said too much about myself and what I'm doing or concerned about in life right now.  Was he just terribly embarrassed, either BY me or FOR me?  That was the expression on his face from what I could detect.  So I've asked the Yi, ""Why did X look so embarrassed to speak to me?""  The reading:  Hex 21.6 becoming Hex 51.  I take it that I've shocked him into a stupor?Not able to get a whole lot from that reading I did a second casting:  ""What was his point?""  And the result was Hex 31.3.4 becoming  Hex 8.  Which to me says something about being polite to a person who is incorrigibly rude.  Like, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Seems an extreme reaction to a couple emails, but maybe I'm reading something upside down."
1003,"Greetings everyone,during a recent trip I found some foreign currency in my wallet. I had kept it there by mistake (it was not in the currency of the country I was visiting) together with some banknotes from my own country. There were a lot of movements in & out since - I purchased local currency and put it in the wallet, took the balance of my currency out and put it in my bag, then did the reverse - and I completely forgot about the third currency I had with me. Now I can't find it and although I've tried I seem not to be able to recall where on earth I put it. Or maybe I lost it? So I asked:""Dear Yi, please advise, where did I put the money?""and received Hex. 26 unchanging.Now, looking at Wilhelm's translation, I find a number of hints litterally applicable to my reading, in bold below: 26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Greatabove KêN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAINbelow CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVENThe Creative is tamed by Kên, Keeping Still. This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger. The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept ""Holding firm."" Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên which holds the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which represents the sage.THE JUDGMENTTHE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.Perseverance furthers.Not eating at home brings good fortune.It furthers one to cross the great water.To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.THE IMAGEHeaven within the mountain:The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquityAnd many deeds of the past,In order to strengthen his character thereby.Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to strengthen and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past is not to confine oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application of this knowledge, to give actuality to the past.My take is the money is still with me, hidden somewhere, and I have to use all possible clarity of mind to recollect where I did put it, possibly going through my memories step by step (as if it were easy ). Maybe the reference to eating out is a hint as well?! Being a novice chances are I'm completely off track  so any help will be as usual appreciated!Have a great day,Cris"
1004,"Hello everyone,I'm new to this community - and relatively new to I Ching interpretation, which I've eagerly been reading about on this forum before joining. I would appreciate some help with two readings I've recently made on the Internet (I sense these will not be as valuable as the ones manually drawn, but synchronicity should still be at work!).A brief background: a couple of months ago I started a relationship with someone I had met online. He turned cold pretty soon after the start, so although I cared I decided to put an end to it. Ever since I have heard from him only once. I asked the IC:""What approach should I take to the situation with this person?""I got 23.3 -> 52Then I asked:""Can I expect this person to contact me?""I got 24 unchanging.Althrough the questions I asked are different, I'm under the impression the responses are slightly contradictory. Can someone please enlighten me ?Thanks in advance!Cris"
1005,since a few weeks I'm in contact only trough emails with a woman...I never see her... I only know that she is ten years older than me.....our emails regards only the IC and my point of you regarding her riding's!!!she wrote about her work problem but that's all!!!well....since a week I'm waiting for an answer from her.... but nothing....so I say to IC: y does not let me hear no more from her!!the IC answered: 31I'm curious to know your opinion!!!
1006,"Hi there dear Yi followers!For the sake of practicing, I made another attempt at the Plum Blossom method. I used Early Heaven, formula one, for a question about the arrival of news from a person (a classical example of utilisation of this method, and also a topic I have recently casted a traditional reading about).""Will X get in touch?""25.2 > 10The upper trigram of the predictive hex was determined by the number of letter in X's name; the lower one was calculated using date and time when the prediction was made.Fate trigram: Chen / woodSubject trigram: Chien / metal.Wood injures metal, thus indicating some difficulty.In the second hex, both trigrams (Tui and Chien) are metal, supporting each other as well as the subject trigram in the first hex. This is auspicious. (For the sake of simplification, I have not considered the relationships created by the inner trigrams).So, after initial hindrance, a contact appears likely. The new trigram created by the changing line, Tui, is associated to number 7 in the Later Heaven sequence; the time scale could therefore be 7 days or maybe weeks (hopefully not months, or years ).Looking at trigrams' attributes, Chien (the subject trigram) symbolises a man (X); Chen (the fate trigram) is associated to communication (for instance, a telephone); Tui is joy. This could represent an uplifting call made by X.Last but not least, line 2 of Hex. 25 reads:""If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,It furthers one to undertake something""which could again suggest a light-hearted, spontaneous contact by X.I would love to hear opinions / comments / suggestions by other Plum Blossom ""fans""! NightyCris"
1007,"Hi everyone,a couple of friends are not keeping in touch so I decided to ask the Yi for enlightenment.1. ""How should I proceed in my relationship with X?""47.1 > 582. ""Why is Y not keeping in touch?""1.1 > 44Neither appears promising to me...  Would appreciate any insight!:bows:"
1008,"Hi all,I did a reading a few days ago and I'm trying to figure out whether the outcome of this divination is positive/negative. My question was: I'm anxious to see X (really don't want to see X again if I could avoid it), but L&R have been good friends to me and I really think I should go to their wedding. What would happen on the day when I see X?Yi's answer: hex #10.2 TREADING, explanation: this gua expounds upon the principle of carrying out one's duty in a difficult situation (I'm surprised by the answer! exactly how I feel. ) Mutual hex: #37 HOUSEHOLDFinal hex: #25 INNOCENCE When I analyzed the reading based on Plum Blossom method, it looks like the number of supportive and un-supportive elements (using the date of the divination, which is June 29 2010 11:45 pm) are almost equal, so I assumed that I would feel okay on the day? However, I'm confused by the final hex #25. According to the book ""Authentic Iching"" by Dr Wang Yang & John Sandifer, #25 is one of the clash hexagram. It's an inauspicious hex. Does this mean then, that at first I would be okay, but at the end of that day events might not go so well for me?  Because I noticed that one element has changed from fire (in hex 10) to water (in hex 25), and my element is earth. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated! Anxious,suntea"
1009,"Howdy all!  A few weeks ago I was on here with my question to the IC about my writing, and with y'alls help I came to feel the IC may have really been answering questions/issues about me wanting to feel more grounded.  So I have recently asked the IC the question ""What will help me in becoming more grounded?""  and I received Hex 31 with lines 4 and 5 changing to Hex 15.  Hmm, the influence of modesty/humility....  Or that maybe I need more humble/modest influences....or I need to be influenced to be more humble.  I guess this is another one which has me a bit puzzled."
1010,"I absentmindedly left my cat's eye ointment (she has a slight infection) in the car for two hours this evening, and I was worried that the heat might have made the medicine ineffective. (Today was unseasonably cool and dry; however, the sun was still out and it was warm inside the car. )A study about the erythromycin (here) says the heat would not have ruined it. But before I found that information, I cast a reading:  ""How effective is the erythromycin ointment after sitting in the car for two hours?"" Yi's response was 1.3 changing to 10:1.3‘Noble one to the end of the day creates, creates.At nightfall, alarmed as if in danger.No mistake.’What I thought this was telling me was either that it's not a mistake to be alarmed, or, that no mistake was made since the medicine was in the car while my cat roamed around the yard having a good time. (In other words, medicine ruined in the cause of making a cat happy was not a mistake ) Either way, I thought the medicine would have to be replaced.I now know for sure that the medicine is fine. But how did the reading tell me that? Where did my interpretation go wrong?(I also wondered if the reading somehow alluded to the study I hadn't yet found, but I don't see that either.)Thanks!"

1014,"Hello First of all I would like to thank you all for sharing your love and understanding of the I Ching so kindly and generously.  I posted a couple of threads over the last year and your answers and feedback inspired me to make use of the wonderful resources that are available on this site, for which I am truly grateful.  Your comments really made a difference to me.I am trying to follow the advice offered here on how to consult the I Ching and I feel I am getting a bit better with my interpretations but I was wondering whether I could get your views on a recent reading?  It's about work, an old chestnut of mine...  I had a bit of a difficult time with my job over the last year.  For background, back in November I posted a thread which was of great help to me (http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=8965).  In the end, I tried to deal with the situation by changing my attitude, which worked to some extent.  Recently, things have started shifting a bit: I have been given new roles and responsibilities, which mean more work but also new opportunities.  The thing is, the new roles put me on the spotlight and it is not a position I enjoy.  I feel out of my depth and I worry all the time that I am going to make a mess.  When things work out, there is a lot of satisfaction, but I swing all the time between misery and excitement and I am wondering (again..) whether I am on the right track.  I asked:""what about putting my efforts into finding another job?"" 51.3 > 55""How about committing myself to the current situation for another year, embracing the challenges and the emotional rollercoaster?""Hex 9""Please give me an image about the kind of work that is right for me at this moment in time""20.4.6 > 45Your views on these readings would be much appreciated.  The meaning of the lines of the third reading in particular are not very clear to me: I am not sure if the I Ching is telling me something about the attitude I need to find an answer to my question, or whether it is answering my question, but if so, what kind of work is it pointing at?Many thanks in advance for any thoughts you may offer.  All the best."
1015,"Hi thereFollowing Hilary's ideas about asking for a weeks review or focus - I did ask what should my focus be this week - and got 24 with moving line 6.  Can anyone open this up a little bit more for me - it doesn't make any sense - returning to one's path - yes, I am going back to myself somehow & finding my way through meditation and energywork - and got a very good and affirmative i ching reading on my choice of path - (returning to one''s way - how could this be a mistake? 9:1) but this as a focus for the week is odd and I don't get it.  Also don't want to risk a big blunder that might cause 10 years worth of damage.....

1016,"Hello,Little job help. Just would appreciate instant impressions of a couple of readings done online just now. I do prefer tossing the coins because I think the time that takes gives your thoughts a chance to also consider the situation. So I will also probably do that.I have almost definitely decided to take a job in Suzhou, China, but have been offered another for slightly better pay, more challenging but perhaps better teaching with smaller classes and a mix of kindergarten and primary which might be a relief from only kindergarten, more hours, but in a smaller town called Wuxi (on Lake Tai which is apparently a v beautiful little town with canals, but probably without the mod-cons/westernised area of Suzhou which I will appreciate if I'm there for a year (english bookshops and cinemas etc.) but suzhou is only 39 miles away (which in China terms is absolutely nothing - now I think 8 hours on a train to get somewhere is fine! North to South can be an over 24 hour train journey but has to be done to see the country! Overnight sleeper trains are really good though.)New position in Wuxi?Hex 49Yes it would be a radical change as I did feel set on Suzhou (in a school that has offered me a place teaching only kindergartners and only for 15 hours a week and short classes, so I could combine with a bit of freelance work). But hex 49 encourages a revolution - could it be saying shed this idea like a non-suitable skin? Or change direction towards this job? I guess working as a teacher for a year would really determine whether I have sufficient teaching skills. And teaching primary is slightly more challenging of course, but also sometimes easier as they catch on quicker and have more developed characters which makes for more fun exchanges. But then I haven't experienced teaching kindergarten... Anyone with experience in this area?Original offer in Suzhou?5.4,5 > 34Hmm.... Maybe this is saying not to doubt this offer and muddy it? Or that I am waiting in an unsitable place? (5.4) Or to enjoy myself waiting for my time there to begin in Sept? Or to enjoy weighing my options and not take action yet? (5.5) Could 34 be saying this job offers great power? Or is this about misdirected energy? This job offers slightly less pay, but I think more freedom in terms of being able to do other work. And of course be in a big city. But that might encourage over spending... and maybe Wuxi would be a more Chinese experience? Plus I could get away on the weekends... Hmm.What are your impressions please?Thanks in advance :bows:"
1017,"Hello!Ok. I have another reading for feelings, but now is about my feelings.I have recently started doing mindfulness meditation in a Buddhist Centre. But I am feeling quite strange these days. A mixture of sleepness with sickness. Very strange indeed.I asked I ching, what's that I am feeling, what's happenning to me? 33.2,5 changing to 50.I can see from Wilhem's text, something about line 2 being something bad (the inferior man) stuck to me, and 5 being me wanting to be free from it. And then it comes the hex 50. Does that mean about looking for spirituality?Any ideas? Please?Thanks in advance.Iesha"
1018,"Hi there everyone I am new to this forum, and this is my first post! I asked the question ""Will my ex partner come home, is there any hope?"" and drew hexagram 18. To me, it means that there is a chance, and that it would need work to repair the rot that has set in- which I would gladly and happily do. I understand my part in what has happened, and his too, all I wish for is to correct it all and get back together again. The thing is though he has moved on in life, we have been apart for a couple of years now and it just seems like a miracle would have to occur for him to come back home, I love him very much, we have a lot of history, but am not so sure that the feeling is mutual any more Any insight from you guys would be much appreciatedThank you Last edited: Jun 8, 2010"
1019,"Hello all.  I've been working with the Iching on and off for years but have only begun to take it seriously.  I have been impressed by these forums--by the thoughtfulness present in the answers as well as the true spirit of collaboration and search for truth.Well, I have a question if anyone would be willing to answer?  It is regarding a reading I just did.   I have a lot of anxiety and possibly OCD and asked how I could best improve these conditions. I have been wondering about medication, therapy, etc.  I got Hex 52 then the 3rd line is the line that I was supposed to read then it changed to 23.  Now, I got kind of freaked out and this is the problem with anxiety--sometimes I have anxiety around my relationship w/ my boyfriend.  So I read this as meditate..and then break up with your boyfriend--which might be kind of silly, I don't know.  I mean, I guess if I'm anxious about my relationship (really any relationship I'm in) breaking up would relieve me of the anxiety, but I have a feeling I'd be even more anxious about being broken up! However, perhaps because of my anxiety blinding me, I can't seem to get a more accurate read on the second Hexagram.  Is there a non-relationship reading to #23--one that might be more in line with ideas for relieving myself of anxiety and OCD tendencies?  Thank you!!!"
1020,"Hello everybody,some times ago I asked about shared custody in a divorce settlement and the ching (as willofox) told me to negociate that I could not win ... well since then I negociated I tried veeerrrryyy hard to make him understand, no way.The thing is that not only he does not want to give me shared custody of the children (on petty motives) but he wants to stay in the house (which is mine) a lot of money ... all that because I'm leaving him (I have to add that I leave him because he is verbally abusive, he always made me feel I'm worth nothing ecc.)So I'm tired of negociating because his concept of negociating is ""you give me what I want and then you can go"" so I'm thinking, I send the papers and the judge will decide for us. So my question is: will it be good for me if I stop negociating with X and go to the judge?I got 63.1.2.5 to 46While 63.1 tell me not to rush (god it's 5 months that I'm not rushing)63.2 tells that I what will be taken (or wants to be taken from me) it will be also given back in a short period of time 63.5 means i have to get used to be poor?

1021,"Dear all,I left the retreat from which I posted last, and where I was getting very torn down about things. Being back in the city and seeing people again I was already offered the possibility of following some new projects, some new routes, to start building something up for myself again. I've pondered longly in all the short-term scenarios (what I wish to be doing in the following months) and I narrowed it down to 3 situations. Plan A sticks to what I have been doing so far, same area same city different strategy, Plan C is a completely new realm, going down to a community for a while and engage in some new creative work, and plan B is a mix of these both.Which do you see best?What are the consequences of following plan A ? 48,3 > 29What are the consequences of following plan B ? 17, 4, 5 > 21What are the consequences of following plan C ? 37, 1, 3 > 33Before asking I noted down that my impressions were being afraid of Plan A (stagnated in a situation I know and that is bringing me down lately) being afraid of Plan C (loosing touch with the network I have in the city and missing out on good opportunities just to be down there) and plan B came as a sort of compensation from these both, but I am suspicious of trying to do it all (stay in the city AND go to the community).After asking...

Today I asked about getting a certain job and got the same answer. So... how did it go with the teaching position you wanted?My understanding of 25.13 leading to 33 is that the potential to get the job is there but somebody else might get it.

1024,"I've asked one of those ""out of the blue"" general questions to see if any important ideas would turn up, maybe something I should be thinking of in a stuck position that I haven't considered.  The question:  ""What's the best thing I can do in my life now?"" resulted in the casting:  Hex 20.6 becoming Hex 8.  Sounds to me like I am contemplating my own behavior, the past, what brought me to where I am, and standing by for a transition to something new.  Doesn't seem to be any particular activity suggested to improve on what I'm doing already:  spinning my wheels and wondering what opportunities could turn up that will help.  Any thoughts?"

Also the question about the possibility of us talking again in the future gave me 28.6 to 44. I think I just feel lonely...and I feel that our break up was for good.

1028,"Hi allWell, I've been very strict about No Contact (it's a policy I've imposed on myself unilaterally to give my ex boyfriend the ""gift of missing me"" - god that sounds so corny   but there is method in it) and am going to keep it up until first week in July.  Contact from him doesn't count (ie it doesn't break the rules if I reply to contact from him) but the rule is that I can't initiate any contact.However tonight I was just feeling especially estranged from him and lonely for him and dying to talk with him (even though I didn't weaken and text him or anything, but I was just longing to talk to him) so I asked:""I'm feeling so estranged from A right now and want to know how he feels about me"".  I got Arguing changing to Seeking Union.  Cheered me up no end, and it's not the first time the I Ching has done that.I'm thinking the arguing part represents the retreat embodied by my No Contact policy (see lines 2 and 4).  But it has made me so happy and relaxed to see that 8 comes up when I ask how he's feeling about me.Comments welcome."

1030,"Hey guys!So I asked the I Ching to help me understand how to master the art of lucid dreaming and decided to share this reading because I thought the reply was interesting and on point.Hexagram 10.5.6 changing to 54I interpreted this as treading the fluctuating trail. Hexagram 10 advises one to walk upright and be alert of the dangers surrounding one in an unfamiliar enironment with line 6 advising one to study the omens in dreamscape. As for hexagram 54, I understood it to mean a state of flux, unstable change and the transitory nature of dreams so the two hexagrams together would form the idea of being alert while following the changing trail.Anyone have other insights into this image or experience with lucid dreaming?"

But then he never replied or picked up the phone, I have to book flights and accommodations and all, and at some point I just wanted to drop A and just go for B, so:What could be the benefits of dropping A and go for B instead? 24.6 > 27Line 6 is just scary, misfortune from within and without and something that can't be fix for a long long time...I completely dropped the idea of workshop B...But now I was just on the phone with the teacher from A and he doesn't take me into his workshop. He says I'm not ready, it's for people who have done much more work with him, it's a very intense 7 day venture and he feels I need a stronger base. So we negotiated coming together for a smaller weekend workshop somewhere else in Europe later in the year - he will let me know dates eventually...So now, no possibility of going for marvelous 45/40 workshop A, and a really scary line in workshop B... Can you share some thoughts on this with me?Thank you!"
1032,"Hello ,   I am new to this community and quite like all the discussions and learning through them. I have an important decision to take with which I could use some help.     Me and my husband have decided to buy a house. I am currently renting a flat. It is a big step for us considering a huge loan to pay back. At the same time, it could also be a good investment. I asked for some clarity on this decision and received 52 changing at lines 3 and 6. The resulting hexagram is hexamgram 2. I do not quite understand whether its the resulting hexagram which makes sense here or the changing lines.  I would like to give some background on this question which might give you a better understanding of my circumstances. I have been wanting to buy a house since the last two years. My husband wasn't very supportive of this and neither was his family. Due to family influence and at times rather interference my husband decided to completely drop the idea of buying a house. My frustration begun to grow as I was working and earning but couldn't buy something that was important to me and most of all my husband wouldn't cooperate. I started meditating to get peace of mind and still hoping for a divine solution to my problem. This has always helped me to get better clarity and move towards more harmony in my life. Recently, someone called up and presented a deal to my husband and to my surprise my husband agreed to go ahead with this. I am glad this happended but the place is a bit too expensive. So I am confused as to whether this is a good place for both investing in and living.  I would like to thank everyone who took care to read all the way to the end and help me. God bless Zarna"
1033,"Hello, I hope everyone is good. I'd like to share one of the clearer readings I've had.The chance of taking a free flight to australia in two days has just fallen into my lap today! It is about helping a post-surgery elderly man I don't know handle his luggage and walk around and such during the trip back to his house in australia. Once he arrives at home I am free to stay in the country (I have an australian passport) or go back home. His insurance company will pay for a business-class seat for me to accompany him and his wife. There is nothing in my life that I cannot drop and use the opportunity for a month or two in australia, except one thing: This weekend will be the 11th and final monthly meeting of a course I've been taking this past year. This course has been a very strong turning point in my life that has changed me for the better in many ways and given my life a stronger sense of awareness and direction, and next year I will continue with this organisation and take an active part in it.So I asked the I ching what would happen if I take the trip and recieved 4.1->41. To me this is talking about controlling the urge to drop everything and leave, and instead using my discipline. Line 1 seems to be talking about education which is fitting since in this course I was learning and the second half of it (next year) will be about passing it on: the main theme of the organisation is to do with education.Then I asked for an image of what would be like if I stay here an recieved 46.2->15. This again seemed also very fitting, because it speaks of will power (choosing to stay rather than go, also the process of learning requires much will power). Two years ago I was travelling and although I was enjoying I felt the urge to go back home and deepen my roots (was the term I used at the time but on what to concentrate I didn't exactly know at the time) rather than wander with no real purpose. Reading the part about the tree pushing up through the soil reminded me of this immediately.I think I will not take the trip, I feel good about this decision and I think the IC is advising the same. What do you think?"
1034,"Hey all! Thanks for stopping by to check this out. Yes, I'm  a spinster I cannot go to the past (loves), have nothing in the present and the future seems bleak. this is just to give a background The question about my romantic future and new loves produced 15.2.6. to 18. I truly hope that it does not advise me to go back to the people who did not make me happy. Then it's seems to talk about the present - basically, yeah it sucks - deal with it. Be modest...I wonder what is the meaning of this modesty? -CCLast edited: Jun 23, 2010"
1035,"Hi everyone,I'm sharing this one mostly because I found it curious, but of course I would also like to read your opinions. I've been away in a sort of a retreat for a week now, where I am alone, don't really see anyone, so I end up ""talking"" to the Y more often than usual. In the last week I asked an average of 2 questions per day - and they were all unchanging answers. Well, as a beginner, I happen to be pretty bad with answers with no lines. I rarely get anything out of it. I was mildly depressed about things when I got here one week ago, but I see now I only grew worse with the days. This morning I woke up very anxious, disturbed, even aching, and I couldn't calm myself down. So i asked the Y,What is going on with me? 22 unchanging. I admit when I read it it felt like a bad joke. This phase seems like everything except Genuine Beauty. Throughout the day I read carefully different translations and also older posts here on the forum about 22, and eventually I could find a way to squeeze some meaning out of it, but I admit it feels far fetched. I have often this feeling with unchanging hexagrams, so I decided to give it a try and ask the Y directly:How should I read unchanging hexagrams? and got 23... unchanging!!! This one really intrigues me. I was thinking that this answers might be telling me whenever I get such an answer it's not time to take action ""It does not further one To go anywhere""""Hence it is not cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.""""The right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images and their attributes.""It's also possible the Y is telling me to let go for a while... I have been asking way too much... Thanks!Yo:bows:"
1036,"Hi All!I've been having a really hard time at college this past few days (I think I might get expeled for some stupid mistake that I didn't commit), anyways I asked the Yi ""Guide me regarding my academic future"" and got 15.3 > 2, I saw this as my efforts will be acknowledged, however since my future is so dark (at least the way I see it), I don't know how to interpret this readingCan anybody please help me??Thanks"
1037,"Please help me!I have questioned the IC tonight about spending 2-3 weeks with my family (12-hour road travel to there).  As I am unemployed and job offers are rare this time of year, I thought I might visit them next week.   I thought also that spending time away with no contact from my ex-boyfriend could make him miss me and think of me.The answer I got I found confusing:  Hex 19 lines 1 and 2 changing to hex 2.Should I stay or should I go?"
1038,"I have a new business idea that im thinking about so I asked the question.  What is the possibility of sucsess with my business idea in this current climate.  Then answer I got was 19  L 3 & L4 changing to 34.  Im not to sure on this one.  19 means to approach, but line 3 says something about impurity and line 4 is something about remaining open.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks."

1040,"Hey people, Lys here again, as some of you call me Some people might not be familiar with me and my story so i'll sum it up. My ex fiance and I are/were reconnecting and we had an issue with ""physical intimacy"" where i wasnt so sure about reconnecting it that sense because I felt we weren't in the place we should be for it to happen. After a couple weeks things were good between us so we sort of resumed our physical connection. I say sort of because our relationship is currently long distance so it's more an online thing.Anyways, after that happened he became distant, i tried to talk to him a few times during the week (2) but he was dismissive and said he was busy, i let him be. Only today he initiated contact for a little bit (right now as i wrote this post)In a previous reading, when i was asking what i could do to improve my relationship, the oracle adviced me to be more open minded. So now I asked ""What should I expect from X and our relationship now"" and I got 22.3.5 with relating hex 42.From what I understand, this talks about a time for beginnings, not for results, being careful about not to rely so much in external appeareances yet at the same time not to abuse simplicity. The relating hexagram seems to be advicing me to be active and ""participate"" from the increase instead of holding back. The superficiality contained in Hexagram 22 makes me think about this not being a time to commit, yet the related hexagram i interpret it as a sign of an evolution of the relationship in the future, after this seemingly superficial time. (Maybe take the heat and stress out of a relationship that has been rather stressful and full of pressure, for it to be able to develop to the next stage)Since I am a beginner in this kinds of interpretation, I would love some insight."
1041,"Knowing full well that ""if"" questions aren't the best, I just asked one anyway, simply because I couldn't think of another way.  I'm contemplating the whole earth these days:  where to live, work, you name it.  It all runs in a big circle around the room, out the door, and back in again.  Today I'm up to asking whether the man in my life -- well maybe halfway in my life -- would give a care if I moved away for better employment.  We seem to be in better contact these days, but nothing earth shaking.The casting:  Hex 30.5 becoming Hex 13.  Can we safely assume he would care -- or is that me weeping great mournful tears?"
1042,Hello all!I'm new here and to I Ching. I heard about I Ching for years but I just started to study this wonderful oracle in these days.Today I asked: What can I do to have positive and stable relationships?This is what I got: ______________ ______X_______ ______________ ______O_______ _____        ______ _____        ______Could someone give me some insights and advices about it? Thanks and sorry for my english! 
1043,"Hello to all,I have been following threads for a long while now and have just decided to become a member today.  Wonderful site and community I have asked IC last night ""How should I see X and Y's relationship"" (my ex's new relationship).  I still have deep feelings for him and he told me that he still had feelings for me too; however, he left me in Oct. to be with her.  We have been talking everyday now for the past 4 months and seeing each other at least once a week.  I asked the IC this question to know if I should just let it go, encourage their new relationship or keep hoping for his return.  Should I see hex24 as his return to me?I thank you all for your support and hope that I can also be of help. :bows:"
1044,"Hello, I'm wondering about a possible rift with someone I care about and how to proceed. I get the feeling my friend is upset because typically when upset, X shuts down and withdraws which is what seems to be happening here. I've tried to contact X but not gotten a response yet. If there's something to mend, I want to do so. If it's a matter of giving X space and being patient, I can do that.I asked for general direction about best action now, eg should I keep waiting to hear back etc?45.4.5>2Gather together for unselfish reasons, for reasons that benefit everyone and all will be well. Trust needs to be restored. Follow, don't lead. What does X want me to do about her?22.1>52I'm stumped. I looked at several different interpretations and can't find any that seem to fit...walking without the carriage, leading to inner stillness? Move simply, without artifice, and stay centered? Hmmm...need help with this.What do I need to know about X's (non-responsive) behavior now?54.2.4>24Which I take to mean, there's been some disappointment but with waiting, things will turn around. Look forward to your insights...thank you.:bows:"
1045,"I ask your understanding at the frequency of my visits here at this time - I don't enjoy asking for ongoing help but things are nearing a head.  I've written before about the difficult scenario my husband & I are in with his wanting to cycle back to his native NZ and not knowing what will happen to us - its a call he can't ignore & yet for me this is what could be the end of our 10 year marriage. The thing is is that we are committed to stay where we are in our joint job until the end of the summer possibly more and he can't decide what to do for both our sakes. He hasn't handed in our notice yet and neither of us know what to do.The thing is I can't read about grief without feeling the agony of pain inside - yet he's not going yet.  I love him so completely and yet I can't grieve his going.  It does feel like carnage inside - but unexpressed except in writing.  When I talk to him about it he doesn't know what to do for the best.  He is in as much indecision about when & how to go as I am in pain at his leaving without committing to coming back.  I've written realms about it to try and express it and finally today in desperation asked the I Ching ' what would your guidance be in this situation?' focusing on the pain and the love and the not knowing.  Do I accept the not knowing and enjoy the summer letting the pain dissolve, do I... what?  It hurts so much and yet we still have time together - possibly until Feb now - with great fun & love as well.  I am in such confusion - but I don't want this to turn inwards and cause me some ill health as I have had meningitis 3 times due to stress.  I appreciate your insight into this situation.  The answer was 18:2, 5 and 6 - 33.  Unfortunately it smacked to me of the inner pain showing a lack of care and nourishment for myself - and according to Brian Brown tolerating what is a wrong.  And an underlying fear preventing me from seeing the truth.  But some of the words in Stephen Karcher make me wary of how I approach this - I don't want to risk things ending if it needn't be the case.  BIG TIME.  In appreciation, Hebe"
1046,"Hello,I am basically feeling quite anxious at the moment. I had a great few days though with a friend and felt really comfortable with him and had fun. My time with him also really healed me my after my 'terrible encounter' (see previous thread) and I didn't feel like a freak with him. We have since returned to the group that we're both a part of and I feel the dynamic has changed since we got quite close just the two of us and now everyone is back again. This is fine but I suppose I crave that intimacy again, though nothing definite happened, romance wise. I know I'm attracted to him but maybe he isn't I suppose, and now that we're back in the group of course it's not the same. And I know nothing serious could happen for many different reasons, not to mention only having a short amount of time left together, but how I felt just the two of us gave me a high and now I feel low because I'm afraid that however well I get on with people, there's always a component missing that prevents commitment and/or a real attachment/relaxed and close friendship, because of my insecurities and sense of inferiority. I am also slightly doubting the iching today and feel alone. Also as I said, anxious that I have a deep seated problem, mainly from low-self esteem, that is stopping me from living a full life with others and setting me on my parent's path which scares me. Aside from emotional problems I'm feeling better in terms of my life's direction I think...I asked the I ching: can you help me with this sense of loneliness?44.1,5,6 > 34Why can I not be constantly open and relaxed with people? 29.1,4,6 > 9Does he want to get closer again?26.2,4,5,6 > 49Help with these would be much appreciated. Maybe I just haven't met the right person, or maybe it's me....:bows:"
1047,"Hi all,I asked the I-Ching: ""Should I worry about W.?""I got 21.1.2.3.6 > 32I know it's a yes/no question. Yet, I didn't know other way to ask what I wanted to know.W. is a woman who is standing in the way between me and this guy.I used to have faith and the I-Ching has been indicating a positive outcome for me and him but now I just want to move on, forget him. But first I'd like to know what's your opinion on this reading. I have many difficulties in interpreting 21 but I know it relates directly to obstacles... Any 'experts' on hexagram 21? What about 32? I think that's it's telling that this situation (W. and him) will continue for a long time, or has been existing for a long time.Thank you."

1054,"Thank you for reading this post. Bizzare things are happening lately in my life. The Universe sent me this weirdo, a former co-worker who got divorced and for some unknow reason contacted me. I do not respect him, do not find him attractive and generally despise him. But...girls gotta eat...Sometimes occassionally I can go out with him to talk about stuff, I just need a listener. He on the other hand thinks that there is something between us, idiot, he is being cheap, obnoxious with me, his comments hurt my feelings.I tried to get rid of this creature, but he keeps coming back.

1055,"Dear All,Couldn't help but ask for your insight into this -  the hex itself seems to offer a straightforward answer, but perhaps there's more than meets my eye here? Question: can I make this new love relationship work for me? (Currently my new b/f is irritating me more and more...argggh...I'm newly on the Pill, so suspect a good part of this is hormonal, but still - instead of feeling blissful, find myself winding up tighter and tighter. Thoughts of splitting up keep crossing my mind, I wonder: can I make this work for me or is it a lost cause and I'm better off cutting loose?).Hex 22 seems to say yes, you'll be able to make this work for you by being gentle and focusing on the good things about this relationship.Any other thoughts? Your input is valued, as ever.:bows:"
1056,"Hi everyone,to sum up previous threads let me just say that I'm going through challenging times, in which my professional career is reaching its end, the man I chose to love disappeared for months and just came back one day for a very humiliating chat - so mostly I've been handling a heavy feeling of having little to hold on to and seeing the dreams I had slip through my fingers. I'm really not doing fine lately, so I left the big city for a while to regain some clarity... For the big things that failed (career, love) there is not much I can do except to move on. But I was surprised to realyze how much stress and energy the ""smaller"" things actually have, namely ""my"" house.On the one hand I feel it is holding me back, as it grounds me to that city. I'm looking forward to some new routine, but it also feels that house was the last stable thing I had to call my own (even if it's not). The landlord is for ages to put the contract in my name, so I'm actually illegally there - kind of. It is a cheap house for that city and that quarter, so moving blindly implies a financial risk.Today, out of the blue, my closest friend offered me to stay with her for very cheap in a great flat she owns in the same city, but just temporarily while her boyfriend is away. 3 to 5 months. I like the thought of spending more time with her, as we are both always so busy, but again it will be a temporary situation, in her house. It excites me the though of a new quarter, a new routine, new smells, new neighbors, and from there I can search for something of my own.I asked:What are the consequences of leaving this house and moving in with K for a while?58 (4,5) 19The hex sound pretty good, but the lines describe my anxiety, my indecision - and some danger ahead? L4 tells me to correct my ansiety, and that the satisfaction of moving wont bring me peace(???)L5 is hard for me... trusting what is unsustainable (my house or the little time by my friends? they're both unsustainable!) will bring me difficulties/danger.What do you say?Thank you so much...Yoana"

1058,"Hello all,I will be moving to Paris in July to start working for the company of my dreams. I asked: ""What will my time with company Y be like?"" and got 17 > 16. I take this to mean, accept guidance, follow, be part of the team make yourself useful and then, create foundations for your future (the latter is #16, making provision). Is this true?I also asked about my chances of obtaining the contract extension after 6 months (this being the length of the initial, probationary period) and got 53, gradual progress. Is this hopeful? Especially because, when I asked about getting a permanent role, I got 22 > 23 which I think says, do not invest yourself into something this hollow... kind of scary given the huge risk I am taking.  Thank you!"
1059,"Last night my relationship finally broke up, after having lots of problems. I think the main issue was me not being able to regain trust in her after she had left me and wanted to come back. This had caused me contradicting feelings, and a feeling of being lost and not knowing how to act. A part of me (and certainly her) saw my behaviour as childish and frightened. Of course I had felt she had behaved immaturely when she had left me the first time as well.I asked the I ching what is my lesson from all we went through, the answer was 62.3.4.6 -> 64.Is the I ching telling me that trying to save this relationship was an undertaking too great for me, since the ""small"" part in me took over and did not allow forgiveness and new trust? Perhaps extreme caution and hardness of charachter would have required us to be seperate for a while until things relaxed and time for fruitful action came again. In the past months I had asked the I ching many times how to proceed with her and the answer had often been to retreat and wait.How does hex 64 relate? Does it mean the story is yet to end, or is it something else?"

1061,"Today the house I'm renting went actively on the market and I have to admit, I felt just a bit of utter panic.  There are so few places in this part of the world to live and even fewer that are for rent and decent accomodation.  So I asked the Yi:  ""What is the outlook for a new home for me?""  The casting: Hex  44.2.4 changing to  Hex 53.  If I'm not mistake, this is looking rather bleak.  The last reading we did for this there was a miracle in the offing in relation to this issue.  Now it looks like I may NEED a miracle.  I take this reading to mean that there aren't any houses out there.  But then, if that's so, what is the significance of Hex 53 as the outcome?  As Hex 44 is about the most difficult  hexagram to read, the possibilities aren't exactly clear.  Maybe, become a harlot and somebody will give you a place to live?   [I thought  Hex 53 was more about gradual courtship than wild promiscuousness.] At any rate, it seems a strange reading in relation to the question."
1062,"Hi everybody,Though I haven't been here for a while asking for help, I have been looking around the people's threads to see your experiences.Well, today I wasn't able to try and understand myself what the IC was telling me.I asked about a boy, special to me in a strange way. We don't have much in common, but I feel like we have some kind of detached connection.So I asked, what is his feelings for me at the moment? And I got 38.2.4.5.6 > 3I am having a lot of difficulty trying to understand IC text related to heart and feelings. So I focused in the hexagrams images, and would like to know what are your opinion.The 38 hex is fire over lake. Clarity/fire over joy. I see these two together as something related to passion, but I might be wrong. Also it could be that he is realising his joy related to me, or he is going to tell me his feeling anyway (since lake is also mouth and fire is like making things clear).Too many lines. Though I read them, I think it is better to skip to hex 3.The hex 3 is water over thunder. Water is danger and thunder is movement. Also it means the act of filling something that is empty, or something that is still growing but not yet mature enough. Also, I saw that water is related to the heart and thunder to growing.But these are all images and thoughts that I could interpret the way I wish, if I don't read seriously. That's why I ask for your help, please.xxxIesha"
1063,"so i found the i ching sometime last year, since i like to think it found me well for some time now iv been worried about my financial future for the questions about it gave me 55 to make a long story short i asked if i will have 40 million dollarsso it  gave me 30 with 9 at the top with 55 as the outcome   and with 55 it has been my dream literally for some time now(long time ago i dream of matching lotto numbers)does this mean what i think it means?"
1064,"A few months back I was taken by surprise in a conversation -- someone I care about a lot asking a personal question which I tried to answer truthfully and ended up making a mess of the explanation.  It was just too complex to explain easily and so ended up garbled and embarrassing.  Ultimately this seems to have botched up our connection, which I really regret.Amidst the general chaos of my life I've periodically tried to think of ways to patch this up and everything I consider leaves me worried that I could just make matters worse.  So I've done nothing and when our paths cross I act, as much as I can, like nothing happened.It's all an aggravating situation that continues to haunt me so today I asked the YiChing if I went forward with a plan to provide a better explanation, how would that be viewed?  The casting I received was:  Hex 2.1.3.6 becoming Hex 22.  This doesn't look promising, and  I take it I should just keep my mouth shut and live with what I've said already."
1065,"With regard to a fledgling relationship, there are issues of distance and other variables...but the connection is strong and valuable regardless. We've spent quality time together and get on well and lovingly. We've talked some about ways around the obstacles; then there have been financial and family issues, along with our fears and insecurities (from past hurts) in the picture that, at times, sidetrack our progress. I would like to continue and make the bond stronger, despite the present obstacles. X asked me for patience and I have it; yet I want to travel the correct road for myself and for this.Show me how to proceed now with X?13.5>30What is X's relationship to me now? 3.1>8Is this a relationship deserving of my efforts?17.3.5>5513.5 looks like it speaks of the struggle to unite two whose hearts are united. And I need to stay with this and work through the obstacles somehow? In fellowship, with common goals and with clarity?3.1 says that beginnings are difficult but that with proper allies, and by keeping the goal in site, things go well--leading to union, hex 8.and 17.3.5 seems to speak about making mature and non superficial choices and choosing truth in excellence and sincerity for what really matters. Could this mean I need to look at the choices I'm making in pursuing this, that they need to be ""stepped up""...? Or is Yi advising that this is a good, sincere relation for me to pursue if I make mature, wise choices?Can others please chime in with some possible illuminations for these readings here? Thank you,:bows:Last edited: Jun 19, 2010"
1066,"Dear all,in my painful divorce process I came to the epiphany that the real root of all my sorrow is my lack of sense of self worth derived by abuse suffered when I was a child. I coped went very far by myself, good job, good friends, but I realize now that all I went through in my marriage was due to the fact that I allowed him to disrespect me  because I have not a good sense of self worth, thus thinking that it was somehow ok not to be treated correcly ... how typical. So, since I realized that I asked the Yihow can I go out of my lack of self worth pattern?I got 57 unchanging .... and I have no clue. OK just one ... go to a therapist (harvest: see the great man), which I was already thinkng of doing. Any other input?Thanks in advance for your kindness and patienceScorpio"
1067,"Howdy.  I have recently asked the IC a question and found myself a bit confounded by its answer.  I asked ""Do I have anything fresh and new to say with my writing?"" and I received Hex 37.6 changing to 63.  If I am understanding line 6 of Hex 37 correctly, it's talking about setting a good example for others to follow.  I'm not sure what that has to do with my question."
1068,"i haven't seen my step-sister in over 20 years....we were quite close for a brief period in my life, but she is significantly older than I and we never were able to spend a great deal of time together. She recently contacted me to let me know she's been seeing me in her dreams a lot lately.  This is truly an odd thing to ponder given our lack of closeness and communication for so long.  I asked the IC for insight into why I'm showing up in her dreams and the response was hex 5.5 -->11.This really sounds like a great message.  patiently waiting for the right time (hex 5) while enjoying time with friends eating and drinking (line 5) leading to 11 (peace).This all sounds delightful to me right now...I'm currently in high stress mode, pondering and contemplating my upcoming life choices, having second, third, and fifteenth doubts as to the decisions I've made..all to the point that I'm driving myself crazy and am anything but patient, or at peace with anything...  Also, it seems truly inappropriate to choose this time full of my overwhelming tasks with impending deadlines to eat and drink with friends...although that sure sounds much more pleasant than doing what has to be done right now!However, given the lack of closeness to my step-sister and the fact that she's unrelated to any part of my life at all, what could this possibly mean in the context of the question asked?I find it interesting that I was unable to find many references here to Hex 5 with line 5.  That certainly doesn't happen often when I look in the archives here for additional insight!!Thank you:bows:"
1069,"hello dear people.   Having had an encounter with  X  I asked the I Ching which way things are going now between us . I threw Hexagram 2 with lines in the 1, 5 and 6 th place.  I feel quite emotional and I was the one who initiated the encounter on my way home."
1070,Hello Fellow SeekersI have possibly the most important book of my life to write. I'm presently doing my research but don't want to go against the universal flow and miss out on the moment when I should begin to write. The story is about a Chinese Goddess and I am writing it primarily to deepen my understanding of the True Self. When I asked the yi yesterday night whether I was ready to begin writing I drew hex 64 with first 4 lines moving changing to 22. I'm confused because the 4th line says act and the others advise against acting. So where am I now?Thanks for your helpBest for your QuestAnita
1071,"Hi Everybody,In a situation where acting or not acting is a choice (not a requirement), while it is closely connected to (possible) professional advancement, I asked: ""Should I act, or not?"". Another background on this question: I've already done a great deal of work which can advance my professional desires, but in my kind of work, it's not always necessary to ""go out and mingle"" (also travel) in order to get something more afterwards. The work has already been done. ""Acting"" would be a plus, ""not acting"" wouldn't be a minus.So, to resume, the question to you guys is: ""Is 15 unchanging giving any advice on moving/not moving, or is this a completely personal choice in this hexagram?""Any insights on this would be greatly appreciated.Eleven"
1072,"Help ...I am not sure I understand this?!  This past week I made a work shift to work (independent contractor) for another insurance agency.  It is actually one that used to be partnered with the one I was with -but I believe ""egos"" at high levels ended up breaking down.  Health insurance in the USA is in the midst of great change, so perhaps this is part of the answer. (I focus primarily on Health, Accident & Life insurance).Last night I asked the question: Energy of me making the move to go w/this new agency?  I received: 49 (unchanging)I decided to sleep on that one because of the answer (Changing - Revolution) and how this will bring even more change to my life.So this morning got a bit more specific in the question for clarity and I asked:Energy of the ""result/effect"" to my life of making the move to go w/this company for work.  And I received:  42.1.5 to 23This is where my confusion lies ...42 seems like the answer is: I made a positive move.  Both changing lines speak of positive attributes and and overall beneficial time (if I keep my ""head"" straight, so to speak)With it changing to 23 ... Does that mean it is SHORT LIVED?  And I will be changing again??  23 is what is throwing me off.Insight into this answer or if someone has an idea for a question to ask for more clarity, I really welcome that too.With many thanks in much appreciation!Beth :bows:"
1073,"This thread is really a follow up of all my threads I have posted to date, about X who I saw last night and we discussed our relationship, and I burnt my wings ever so slightly.. as a consequence I asked the Yi Ching  if X has feelings for me.  (I don't know if I should ask the I ching those sorts of questions)  I am a little puzzled by this reading Hexagram 22 with lines in the 1 and 6 changing to hexagram 15.  Maybe friendship?"
1074,"Hi everyone,I am again asking for some help here. I have had a long-standing health problem (for years) that I have found very hard to deal with. To cut things short, every now and again I have asked myself if it could be related to a specific body part maybe not working correctly. In case you are wondering what doctors are saying... well, it's testing waters for them too. Years and years of tests and little definite answers. But this thing might explain pretty much all the symptoms I have. I just called the doctor, and apparently it's one thing we haven't checked yet. It might be a deficiency that's causing a huge imbalance. So I got this nagging feeling that this might be where it all starts. Just because I have a lot of pain coming exactly from that organ... I asked the i-ching this question: ""I think it has to do with ...: am I going in the right direction?""I got 59, no moving lines.Dispersion. I struggle a little to interpret this. Wind blowing over flooding water. The wind always gives me an impression of scattering confusion, clearing the air. Entering the Temple... I am not sure here. Might it refer to me handing the matter in the hands of my doctor? Or to trusting my own intuition?If the wind is supposed to carry me through the great water, than this would seem to tell me that by scattering doubt, I will break through the current structure (illness?).On the other side, dissolution might just be telling me that no, I am getting this wrong, and this simply isn't the right direction. What is interesting to me is that ""flooding water"" immediately reminded me of the problem being solved. Sort of, metaphorically,  ""now it's a dry land, but it should be flooding water""... in literal terms, I am now in a ""dry land"" situation... this very closely resembles my current health.I don't know. I guess I am quite emotionally involved and don't want to influence my own reading though my willingness to think this is solution to the problem.Any suggestion would be very helpful...Thanks a lot!turandot"
1075,"After an intense period of activity that raised a bunch of challenges, opportunities and questions, both in my work and personal life, I rather intentionally entered a period of ""limbo"" about eight weeks ago.  I knew that I'd done my best to influence various situations, and now I'd just let myself go with the flow, sit back some and watch, see what further information I could gather - especially about what *I* now wanted to do - by not steering for a bit.Now I feel I've learned a lot, but I'm not quite able to rouse myself to start initiating again, to take much action. Perhaps I still haven't found the depth where my new motivation will arise, or perhaps I'm just deliciously tempted by this state of induced paralysis...So I asked... Q: What activity would best get me moving again?A: 44, 6 => 28"

Over the past few weeks, I have considered contacting my spouse to try to speak peacefully, but something inside me feels it isn't possible.

1079,"Two weeks ago I went on a date with a fellow who then left on a business trip for 6 weeks. The date went well and we spent the night together and I am very attracted to him. I have sent him a couple of emails just to explain a couple of things I said and to ask if he wants to see me again when he gets back. He's said both times he's really busy and will email properly soon. I expect he is really busy being on a business trip on a tight schedule flying between different destinations. But I also think if he wanted to see me, wouldn't he just say? So last time he said he'd email soon was 4 days ago and I've decided to back off. I feel like laying it straight and just demanding he tell me if he wants to hang out again because it is torturing me not knowing where I stand, but I feel the reading may be advising otherwise. My interpretation was that it is saying - allow him to meet me half way and the relationship may seed if there is fertile soil. The question I asked the i ching was for insight into the present situation and I'm interested to hear other people's opinions about the interpretation. Thanks in advance! "

This time however, it was impossible for me to rest my shoulders since the course that i am on is intensive and I am not allowed to miss even a single day. So i'm feeling really helpless!! My real fear is that the injury will linger on and off - this will not be good since it will greatly hinder my real enjoyment of yoga and possibly prevent me from doing some of the more advance asanas..So i asked ""What do I need to know about completely healing my injury?"" 14.2.4.6 > 36Hexagram 14 seems favorable enough, but 36 suggests otherwise..

1085,"Hi all, I'd like some feedback on a couple of readings that I've just done on a topic if anyone can help me in my interpretations.  I'm now on holidays after studying my first semester of a diploma in nursing. I'm feeling a little bit frazzled and tired, and I'm contemplating if maybe I should take six months off next year just to work and hopefully save up enough money to move out of home (I'm 22). I'm liking my course, although it's not easy, but I kind of want a break from studying for a while. The questions I asked were:Please tell me what you think of me continuing my nursing study next semester?Answer - Hexagram 46, Line 5 changing, resulting hexagram 48. I think this tells me to just continue my studies next semester, to keep going. Maybe to pace myself so that I don't get burnt out and stressed so much? Any thoughts?And my 2nd question...Please tell me what you think of me taking 6 months off study to work and move out?Answer - Hexagram 62, Lines 1 and Lines 4 changing, resulting hexagram 36.I feel like the i ching is saying to keep studying next semester, rather than take time off. Maybe I would lose momentum and never go back if I did that. I find this interpretation uncanny: 'Leaving home, doing your own thing, being independent or headstrong will not lead to good fortune in this issue. You are not ready yet.' (dreamhawk.com). Interesting...is it commenting that I'm not ready to move out of home yet? Any thoughts about this line, and line 4? And the relating hexagram 36? I don't quite get what 36 is about or how it might relate. Before starting this course I was studying an arts degree, which I never finished. I guess I just feel restless, and it's november and all. I've been having some doubts about whether I really want to be studying...but I think it's more because I'm being confronted with things that I never have before and I worry that I don't have what it takes. Perhaps I'm just tired.  Good thing I'm on holidays then I guess?My answers were surprisingly clear, I think. Anyone have any thoughts about other possible meanings? Thanks,Alyce"
1086,"Haha. Simple question.. confusing answer. You see, I really like my place that I live at but they charge WAY WAY too much. I'm trying to do some negotiating with the management to get them to offer me about $100 off of rent. So far I've knocked off about $50... I told them I would get back to them later after our last discussion. I asked the I Ching if I should look for and decide to move to another apartment. I received #2 - Kun - Responding with changing lines alternating to #29 - Kan - Darkness.I'm not sure if this is urging me to continue with my pursuit in a lower rent price before settling or what. Any thoughts/questions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all."

1088,I would like him to be my lover ?  And the response I received is  Hexagram 31 lines in the 3rd and 5th place.  Changing to 16.  Does this mean he cannot reciprocate?   even though he initiated the whole interest  in the beginning.
1089,"My mother and sister both plan on being cremated. I am more inclined towards donating my body to science. I have read however that the soul doesn't completely leave the body immediately and I certainly don't want my corpse disturbed while I'm still trying to navigate my way to The Light. So I asked the I Ching, How should I intend to dispose of my remains?I received 34.6 - 14.34.6A goat butts against a hedge.It cannot go forward, it cannot go backward.Nothing serves to further.If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.Gosh, that sounds like the soul trapped in the dead body! Wilhelm says of this line,""If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable to advance or to retreat, and whatever we do merely serves to complicate things further. Such obstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties. But if, realizing the situation, we compose ourselves and decide not to continue, everything will right itself in time."" Does this sound like IC is saying the body should not be disposed of immediately, give the soul a little time to adjust so it can leave peacefully?Hmm.. Maybe I'm going to die in a coma and the key question will be should we put her on life support?14.Possession in Great Measure.At first I thought this hexagram was referring to the body - certainly that is a man's greatest possession! - but then I read Wilhelm's words about the image, ""Man must combat and curb evil, and must favor and promote the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of God, who desires only good and not evil."" I could stretch this into saying in God's eyes the Possession in Great Measure is the soul. Therefore it doesn't really matter what happens to the body because God's concern is only that the soul go on?I then checked the fan yao, 14.6. It seems to be a comment on one's soul at that tricky 34.6 moment when consciousness still needs to agree to release the body. Perhaps it describes a guardian angel come to help at the time of transition? 14.6He is blessed by heaven.Good fortune.Nothing that does not further.In the fulness of possession and at the height of power, one remains modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of the world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence descending from heaven, and all goes well.-WilhelmAnyway, none of this seems to indicate any method of disposing of remains being superior. Seems like it's just saying it's important to let folks know how long I'd want to be on life support, I don't want anyone to pull the plug too quickly but likewise I don't want to hang around when it's time to leave. Well, that's my morning meditation for today. Comments?RosadaLast edited: Jun 8, 2010"
1090,"My significant other has been acting distant (VERY distant) for the past couple of days so I asked the IChing where does he stand regarding our relationship. I got 20.1.6 chanching into 3My take on it is that he is backing off a little bit because he needs to think before taking the next step. From line one i get that he is not very stable yet (he is like the child) so things are not clear for him. From line six i get that eventually he will grow into the noble man and get his act together, though the road ahead is not without trouble (Hex 3).This is my take on it but i might be FAR off, so i would apreciate some insight.

I have since come to stay with him for a few days as he is in the same town where I had a job interview and he offered a spare apartment to stay in in his block. I read more into that than I should, as since being here things have been awkward between us and he's made it pretty clear he's not interested although he's polite and gentle. Too nice though I think - in the sense of not being careful enough to discourage special attention if feelings are not reciporocated.It has been a painful shock. I have been depressed and awkward as a result and thus a terrible guest. I am going to leave tomorrow, but I just feel humiliated.

1100,"Hello.  I asked the question: Will I ever have a ______?  The I Ching gave me 22.3.5 changing to 42.  Also, I should say that what I asked about would include me and another person.  Thank you to anyone giving any insight."
1101,"As the subject line says, of of the friends of my ex, someone I got along with but do not know well, contacted me last week, out of the blue with an email.He has asked me to meet him for a coffee next week.I am wondering why..This ex I am talking about is the one I wrote about last month, the one I wrote a letter to. But he never responded so I left it. I feel great now, good that I spoke my mind and said what I needed to say.It is very odd to me that his friend suddenly contacts me. We haven't spoken in many months.I asked the I ching about it:What is G's intention in asking me to meet?Hex 55.1.3.5 leading to 45andIs X somehow behind or involved in G asking me to meet?17.1 leading to 45I am utterly confused by the lines in 55. The relating hex is the same in both answers and ""gathering"" is not a surprise.Any idea?"

1103,"Hello Fellow Seekers,I'm back with another question that involves my novel - Here Be Dragons.  A highly recommended publisher has asked to take a look at the novel - this based on a story I sent in which she rejected for various reasons but really liked my writing and said she looked forward to more proposals from me.   So I wrote her two lines about my novel, not even a proper query or synopsis, and she said she'd love to look at the whole ms and not to bother sending her sample chapters.  So here I am with butterflies in my belly again!  I drew today at around 8:30 pm - Indian time (June 15) hex. 64 - lines 1,2,3,4 changing to 22.

Seems simple, I could just call him back and ask, right?  Having no clue whatsoever as to what on earth he could want or want to say to me throws me in a tail spin though and I simply cannot just call him back. However, I'm also deeply curious as to why he contacted me at all at this point in time...so of course, I asked the IC for insight...Response:  hex 24.3.4.6 -->30A ""Return"" to ""Separation""?  i see 24 as a return to self..perhaps this sad and misdirected man has finally seen the light and hopes to return to the decent human being he once was?

1108,"Hello there,Will you please help me to see clearly these answers? Maybe it sounds weird that I used the I Ching for this question, but at this moment I am unsure of what to do and I asked for help to the I Ching.Well, I have one cat that stays alone three days per week during the day (sometimes more). She's almost two years and I thought that it would be good for her to have a little companion. I did all the necessary investigations for this and I have a lot of information. And actually, I reserved a male kitten three days ago. All is well so far, but I cannot stop wondering if this will be good for my cat. There's no way she can tell me so... I ended up asking the I Ching.What will be of my cat's life if:1. I bring the kitten: 46.4 > 322. I don't bring the kitten 49.6 >13Will you please let me know what you think about this?Thank you very much in advance,Thys."
1109,"Heya allI was offered some job in a political party, in fact, they have plenty for me. It's a volunteer job and I accepted it having in mind different things: to see how things work in this environment which is unknown to me, to meet people with (maybe) interesting ideas and commitments and last but not least to improve my chances to find a paid job (through relations).But I also have a paid job from time to time in a big hospital, and some personal projects. So I am wondering if this volunteer job is worth the time I spend in it, and if it will bring me something useful (like work opportunities).

1110,"Hello Everyone,How are you all?! I hope all is well and that you're enjoying this glorious June!!So, I'm definitely moving back home to L.A. from London. It was a difficult decision, but, thanks to all of you wonderful members of this forum, I was able to see the ray of hope and hop on back over the Atlantic to where I belong.Anyway, I'm leaving in weeks. Resigned on Tuesday, making my social rounds with all of my friends before I leave and I'm hopping on the plane in less than a month! WHOA! What a transition!I'm SO excited, scared, terrified, everything! But mostly excited and absolutely exhilarated!It's going to take a little while to get my stuff together when I get back home initially, but I'm starting to apply for jobs now, etc. I applied for my dream job, but I'm not expecting anything too much, I'm just being open to whatever happens.Anyway, yesterday, after I finally sent my application over to the dream job, which I'd been waiting to do for months, I asked the Yi: ""What will be this company's perception of my application? How are they likely to respond to it?"" I got 51 unchanging. I thought, OK, they're going to be shocked! But I love this hexagram, because it's always a good shock, even when it's scary. It's just so danged fertilizing.Then I asked: ""What is the likelihood of this company advancing me through to the next stage of the application process?"" I got 27 unchanging. Nourishing is such an interesting hexagram to me. I get it quite a lot when I ask about career questions, related to what I do, which is writing/publishing.Today, I had some dinner and drinks with a good friend of mine who happens to be a Londoner born and bred. LOVE HER. She came and visited me a few years back in L.A. while I was still living there. We had the BEST time ever, so many legendary memories! I was inspired, I didn't realize how much fun I had in L.A. when I was living there. I asked the Yi today: ""What is the likelihood of having high quality fun this time around in L.A.?"" I got 61.2.5 to 27. That's kind of WHOA. I'm thinking that this is saying that I just need to be my charming self (hahaha) and it'll be all good, I'll get droves of cool people to kick some socks off with. I think it's also advising me to be cognizant of the people around me (whether they are good people, or really fake Hollywood types with bad souls) and to watch what comes in and out of my mouth. I also find it odd that I got 27 twice in two days--I figure this indicates that I may meet a lot of people through my future employment somehow, or a lot of people to network with?So, to finalize this whole move back to L.A. transition reading, I asked, in relation to the 51 Shock reading I pulled yesterday: ""How will the shocks that were brought up in yesterday's reading affect my professional life?"" I got 58.1.3 to 28. Well, I think it's clear from the first hexagram that I can expect a little bit of joy from the shocks! It also indicates good natured exchange. The first line I think is all about being confident, peaceful internally, and from this sunny, secure place, I'll be able to radiate good energy and not be so rattled by undulating circumstances. The third line slightly freaks me out though. Don't know if I get it so much. I think it says not to try to force things, just go with the flow. Finally, the relating hexagram, 28, indicates to me that I'll have to make a decision quickly. WHOA, it kind of sounds like I may have a few options to choose from! That's exciting! But, of course, I may be wrong.Anyway, WOW that was a mouthful! Talk about nourishing! HAHAHAHAHA!Thank you so much for reading this! I would very much appreciate any further guidance anyone could give me on these hexagrams. Speak to you soon hopefully! Have a fantastic day!"
1111,"After much talk with my family and friends this evening, i wanted to contact my friend E who i have not spoken with since early April.  just a few emails here and there but very quiet.I sent him a vm on his office line.  and stated that i wanted to keep the bonds of communication open since we have been quiet lately and i feel bad about us not talking.  In drawing Hex 32, Last i see how Deeply Desirous i am wanting still, Long Continuance in our relationship.

I do not know what happened.  He has emailed me before, actually and we were playful, but this is not really him.  He is definately more deeper in speaking with me about things, but i feel distant and something is going on.  i am not sure but i hope to get a favorable response with my friend.  want to be able to talk to him again and have him tell me that we are ""cool with each other""  something hurts my heart too much to let this guy go away again for another 33 years and this is what i also mentioned.thank you for looking at my post.also, i think i asked before...are there any times/months to these Hex""s Hex 32Hex 11  just curious:bows::bows::bows::bows:"

Like the oracle was telling me that I need to ensure that my more vulnerable and nurturing aspects could be easily taken advantage of if I didn't take precaution.LiSe's interpretation seems to make reference to making sure the conditions were right for the seed to bear fruit and form correctly. In other words, guard what is precious to you, or you will not reach the full potential of what you are hoping for?If anyone has input, I would love to hear it Namaste"

1115,"Hello again .. I feel strongly drawn to a trip to the Sinai Desert to do a 3 day solitary retreat in October, when it could be, if my husband does leave, the beginning of a new life alone so to speak.  Trouble is, it clashes with a congress which could be a good way to learn more about my new profession.  I  could be in a state of needing to let go of grief and sadness at that time as that's when my husband is planning to go.  I got 25 with lines 2 and 3 moving relating hex 1.  Having read threads, I seem to get an idea that the I Ching could be telling me to just hold off on planning & go with the flow right now instead of planning.  But also it could be about letting go of all the emotional grief & pain that I am holding onto right now.  Either way, they are both different takes & I'm not sure which is more insightful?  I read Trojan's take in wikepedia and then got even more confused as that seemed to be saying something different again.  Any thoughts?  Yes, I am new to I Ching.  Hebe"

What kind of waiting is it actually talking about? Waiting and being unnoticeable, waiting and doing what you can under the circumstances, or something else?Thank you very much for your insights! "
1117,"Hello there.  So, as a couple of you may know, I'm going through some horrible stuff with the man I recently married.  He has taken off to Japan (where we are supposed to move together) and has decided to reneg on our four year relationship.  I am pretty sure it has to do with a fetish involving Japanese girls (boooooring!), and not for the reasons he's given me.Like a stupid, I've been asking the Oracle if we'd ever be together (because I want to get back with him.  Why?  I don't know!).  In my readings, I keep on getting hexagram 58 as a second hexgram.  None of the readings have been bad; in fact, they seem fairly encouraging.So of course today he tells me he's seeing someone else.  I ask about their relationship, and  I keep on getting Hexagram 11 (Advance) in and around the question.  (Specifically today I got 11 with no moving lines.)Then I ask if *I* am going to find romantic love (period, with or without said lying thief), and it gives me 58.What does this mean?  Why do I keep on getting Hex 58 (Joyous) when I ask questions about me and him getting back together again or when I ask questions about my own romantic general well-being in a foreign country?  After what I've heard today, it certainly doesn't seem like there's going to be much joy for me. Don't get me wrong, I would love this to be the case, but the situation seems to keep on getting darker and darker.Please help!Thank you,Mercedes"

Over the last couple of days I've felt a need to withdraw and wasn't sure if I was resorting to old habits or if this was a spiritual ""tap on the shoulder.""The question was:  ""Is this course of isolation and reflection the best for me to take at this time?""In response I got 32>50.

1120,"Thinking about Cris' question about finding her soul mate.I asked the I Ching, ""Just what is a soul mate?""I received 25.1.3.4 > 53.25.1Innocent behavior brings good fortune.I say this line incapsulates the idea that without doing anything special -just  being one's self - one will attract their mate. I like this cause it's a little less demanding than the idea that I must be totally absolutely and completely satisfied within myself alone before I can find happiness with another. Maybe just need to be reasonably self-sufficient...lol!25.3Undeserved misfortune.The cow that was tethered by someoneIs the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.Having a soul mate doesn't guarantee there wont be problems.25.4He who can remain perseveringRemains without blame.But it means that by being persevering the problems can be over come.This then leads to 53, the beautiful text about the woman being given in marriage.Usually we think of ""Soul mate"" as meaning there is only one, but reading these lines makes me wonder is the IC saying that if indeed there is a break up - the citizen's loss - then the seeker should remain true to themselves and they will attract another?Anyway, I think it's interesting that Hilary talks about disentangling with hex.25. As far as soul mates this suggests to me that in order to attract a suitable mate it is important we not have too many other entangling alliances. ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the classic example of ""soul mates"" and their love was sabotaged by their family's feud.-rosadaLast edited: Jun 2, 2010"

1122,"Greetings dear Yi friends!For those of you who have read a couple of previous threads of mine, well, the IC was unsurprisingly right: after a few months of struggling with memories and inner resistance, detachment has come. It’s been a natural process, like the healing of a wound or the decay of an apple. I find myself free – and empty at the same time, as usual after any big enterprise or emotional effort. My life, my thoughts are back in my possession – and although I can’t complain about the pace of my daily existence, I wonder what the purpose is if I can’t share it with a special someone.I casted a reading a few weeks ago, about how to change to attract my soulmate:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=10188A similar yet different question has been crossing my mind in the past couple of days, and the moment to ask just hit me. “Dear Yi, please tell me, what should I do to find my soulmate?”The reply: 25.2,6 > 58Innocence to Joyous. Once again, a reminder to be true to myself, and align my attitude to the will of Heaven – just like Hex. 15 had indicated in the previous reading on this subject. “One does not count on the harvest while plowing, nor on the use of the ground while clearing it…”. It looks like I should move on with my life, taking care of my affairs, without purposely “looking”. Line 6 sends a somewhat consistent message in warning me against untimely action: be patient, hurrying the natural unfolding of events would only bring misfortune. I tend to relate this to the last failed relationship as well: taking it easier would have possibly spared me a lot of grief.Joyous is translated by Lise as exchange: giving and receiving. “Thus the superior man joins with his friends For discussion and practice”.Rings a bell… the previous reading too had invited me to open up and share more with people. In a nutshell, in line with the first advise, I should just keep the faith, go with the flow, and try to not only maintain but to also express the inner joy lying inside of me. Overall, it looks pretty auspicious to me.This is just my quick interpretation. Any other views out there?Thanks in advance :bows:NightyCris"
1123,"Asking this question:  what's the best thing to do with my life right now?.... I cast:Hex 54.2.4 becoming Hex 24.  Having just foresaken all interests in the man in my life as he was not especially forthcoming; knowing that my rental home is going bye-bye on September 1 as it's being sold and realising that rentals are thin on the ground here and I haven't sold my house to buy a new one, having a job that I've come to terms with but that eats up all my time for slim return, having received another job offer in a country that is nominally at war, having received confirmation that my youngest child will graduate university July and I'll finally have a coin of the realm to call my own ----------- what on EARTH is the Yi talking about here?Marrying Maiden?  I'm not even trying.  I can, however, relate to the one-eyed hermit part. Sounds like most nights at my house.  Line Two I take to mean that I haven't got the tools I need to work with, I am working at a deficit, but somehow getting by.  All true.  Some days I even laugh about it.  Line Four would indicate something improves?  Somehow I gain some recognition of what I offer or find a way out at the last minute, past the time I would have expected a solution to surface?Hexagram 24.  Could mean returning to the country I came from?  Not likely, there is nobody there I know anymore.  Could mean returning to my old profession:  practically an impossibility as it is very clique-ish and my connections long expired.  Could mean I am in a position to think what I myself want?  That's true, but there are still limitations on that. I have family where I am which I would be hesitant to relinquish to just ""live the dream"" someplace else.  What other experience does anybody have of this reading?  Any one-eyed-hermits out there?"
1124,"I asked the Yijing to give me an oracle for my spinal health and received 62.4.5.6.I have had some back troubles in the past couple of years. I do yoga and it helps, but also makes me more conscious of the fact I need to pay more attention to my back/posture/etc. in my everyday life. I just finished college, and I can tell sitting in cramped desks all throughout my life has not been the best thing for me. I have a sort of scoliosis between my shoulder blades, and it has been both enlightening and frustrating since I've taken up studying/practicing yoga and seeking out other methods like qigong to help with my condition. The yoga shala I go to in town is instructed by a very experienced Ashtanga teacher who I trust, but I am realizing Ashtanga may be too physically demanding for me and may not be right for me to be doing, though he always encourages students to keep up with yoga.I'm just curious how others would interpret this reading. I feel like I'm in a bit of a transitional period and need to consider this aspect of my health seriously. Thank you:bows:,fr"

1129,"Hello,I’m new here and looking for someone to help me with a reading.  Following a particularly upsetting altercation with a friend of a friend, completely out of the blue, and feeling somewhat lost as what I should do about this I decided to consult the i-ching.  I do readings for myself when I feel lost for an answer, I can’t say that the answers I get make sense straight away, but mostly after allowing for a time of processing they have a strange way of unfolding for want of a better word.  However, this time and with desperate need for an answer I cast Hexagram 1.   Funny enough this made me think of two very unrelated, nothing to do with the Hexagram itself thoughts.  These two thoughts are sayings, one by a relative when I was a child and the other by a friend a few years ago, both of these people have now passed away and it is really strange that I should be thinking of these when I read this hexagram.  I would be grateful if someone would give me their understanding of hexagram 1, to help clarify my own thoughts on the matter. Thanks."
1130,"I just got 54 with no changing lines, in regard to an upcoming meeting with my ex-boyfriend, and whether I should try to seduce him.  I am finally going back to pick up some furniture I had left behind.  We have not seen each other in several months.He has a new girlfriend, but in my opinion he actually “traded down”, especially in looks, and not to mention that they live several hours apart and hardly ever see each other. He broke up with me, but I am still sexually attracted to him. I admit, I just want sex. I think 54 is giving me a strong message, but is it advising me not to have any sexual acts with the ex? Or is it just a commentary that I am now the “other woman”?Any insight about 54 (with no changes) would be greatly appreciated.I already know that everyone is going to tell me it's a bad idea, but I am more interested in what the I-Ching says about it.

1131,"Hi there,I asked today, 'what do I need to understand about myself right now?' and got 51!Not quite sure how to understand this...that I'm in a state of shock? that things are quite shocking and suprising right now but not to panic because its just a storm that will pass and leave laughter and relief in its wake? I'm also aware that 51 can be the start of a new phase, of dramatic changes occurring, and I wonder if this is the storm that has been proceeded by the year so far being relatively quiet and calm...I've had a few disappointments and shocks workwise recently (and 51 unchanging in relation to them), and things have been difficult, so I'm feeling a bit disconcerted, I wonder if that's what this is referring to? What is your experience of 51 unchanging in this kind of context?Thanks!E"

1142,"needing a little help decoding this one.  62 has never been a hexagram that resonates with me, so I seldom get clarity from it.  brief scenario:  a friend and i have a rocky relationship. I really appreciate his creativity and his energy, but he can be really erratic, moody, temperamental, and not really empathic to how he is impacting me.  Our relationship seems to go in cycles.  I however tend to be quite passive, largely due to his unpredictability.  He will initiate contact and we hang out for a couple of months, then BANG he does something weird, and we go back to not talking or connecting.  Then a couple months goes by, and he toddles back into my life.  It is however getting to be a bit much, to be honest. And is beginning to feel disrespectful to me.  He is used to roller-coasters -- me not so much.  I asked Yi: what does he want from me?  And got: 62, changing lines 1, 2, 5 to 43. 62: Could be small steps to an end or the end of a journey.  Nothing big. ""The small affair"".  I am not really that important in his life so he takes a ""whatever attitude"".line 1: not sure how to read this in the situationline 2: not sure how to read this in the situationline 5: well, he comes back into my life (hit with an arrow), but he is largely shooting in the cave to see if he will catch anything. Connection, disconnection, reconnection.  At the point of re-connection, it must feel like a shot in the dark.  43: proclamation or decision. In short, I got nothing.  Help!"

1145,"Greetings to you all. A couple of months ago I came across the reference in the Ta Chuan (Wilhem/Baynes) to the nine hexagrams by which the I Ching indicates the formation of character and i have been studying them every day since. About a week ago i woke up in the morning with a dream recollection of Hexagram 14 but without any dream context or reference. I looked it up but didn't understand what it meant. Then a few days later i asked the I Ching the question ""What does the I Ching suggest as a keynote for today?"" the lines 2 and 5 were changing into hexagram 13. I feel that 14 is somehow related to my study of the nine hexagrams of character formation but i'm still puzzled as to its meaning. Do any of you have any insight into this matter? :bows:heh yu"
1146,"I always cringe when trying to interpret a (hopeful) romantic relationship casting.  As some of you may remember, Terry, a fellow who has had a similar painful romantic past as I have had is the one that has my attention.  Everything came on quickly for us and it was amazing, but scared the beejeebees out of both of us, especially him.  As both of us were in serious committed relationships previously (me, a 7.5 year live-in situation, and Terry, a 5.5 year marriage) that both ended in our other halves cheating on us, to find this kind of connection and intensity right away was a bit much to take in and to trust.  So, we decided to take things very slowly.  I mean, excruciatingly, slower than a snail's pace slowly.  Needless to say, this pace is too slow for my liking.  I'd still like to take it slowly, but I'm looking for more interaction, more time together so I can assess the situation and know if he is one I want to be with.  The time apart and intermittent contact drives me nutty.I decided to ask the IC today ""What can I do to advance this romantic relationship between us more quickly?"" and got 26.2.4.6>55.  55 honestly scares me, as a lot of you interpret it as a ""flash in the pan"" kind of relationship.  I do not believe this is what we have here...or at least I hope not.I interpret this casting as the IC telling me to chill out and to play a little hard to get with Terry.  Make him guess how I feel about him a little, so I'm not coming on so strongly and all will work out successfully in the end.  What's your take on it?  Thanks in advance for your interpretations - I appreciate it!"
1147,"I thought of the question that suits me best right now, because ater a long while, i have been thinking of a change in our relationship.  He has been emailing me and corresponding with me again after a while away.  I have been busy at work and also dating others.

Doesn't that mean a change sometime?In my Hexagram 15, lines 6, 5, 4, 2 and 1 were all divided.  forgive me for not being too bright (with anything these days) but this is still confusing to me.  If anyone can shed some light on this and i will go back to the ""drawing board"" and see if i can't make it out some more. Thank you - we are still very friendly with each other and we still talk and email alot when we are reunited again.  but i just stopped emailing today because we just went nuts emailing and talking after a ""quiet spell"" don't want to repeat old patterns again, i want it to be different this time.

1148,"Hello everybodySince the last couple of months I have been returning this website almost daily, leafing through its pages and experiencing a very playfull and creative learning process. I don't often feel the need to share my personal ups and downs with others, not in real life or online, but this fascinating website has provided me with great insights and changed my perspective about online communities. I consulted the Yi Jing this morning about my relationship. We started dating almost a year ago and after 2 weeks he moved in with me. We love each other very much, but living together has been a real trial for me at times. It seems as if all the responsibility falls on my shoulderds and sometimes it's just to much for me to bear. He comes from a very warm nest where everything was taken care of for him. So this is his first time living alone and oftentimes i feel he's just a boy in a man's body. That's cute, but in harder times it's just plain childish. We're about the same age but I have been living alone or over 10 years now. Sometimes I feel myself being pushed in a 'motherly' role and I don't like that at all! I don't want to end our relationship just like that, but I need some answers.So i asked the Yi 2 questions;a) What will happen if i keep investing in this realtionship? Yi says: Hex 24 unchangingb) What will happen if i end our relationship?Yi says: 29 unchangingThe Yi seems to imply for me to have some faith, talk about it to him and give him a chance, and that ending the relationship would be like jumping into danger?Any insights or advice would be very much appreciated!LoveMyladythunder"
1149,"I still don't know what to make of what happened tonight - it was a mix of stalking and high school ""I got a new girlfriend"" antics that creeped me out.  I had split from a man who I spent 7.5 years with (lived together) last December and apparently he's found out where I now reside.  I cut all ties and kept my location secret from him as I knew he'd most likely stalk me in some fashion.  Well, it happened tonight.There is a back road behind where I live that is not traveled often, but intersects with a more major thoroughfare with shopping and restaurants.  I am certain the ex-boyfriend saw me disappear down that road once to figure out that's where I live.I was headed out and saw his truck (the only other vehicle on the road) creeping along slowly in my direction.  The truck lurched ahead as he hit the gas and immediately he and his girlfriend (who, by the way is a married woman with three kids and a husband currently fighting overseas for our freedom in the Army) kissed in a very animated way, to ensure I saw them.  What made it even more creepy was that where I was headed and the time that I left was very predictable.  For the most part of the year, the ex watched me leave each Wednesday evening for the past four years.  He knows that schedule, and it was almost as if he were lying in wait for me to leave.Um, that was odd.  No hyperbole here, folks.  This is exactly as it happened.  The ex cheated on me while we were together and I had to find him out and call him on it to end the relationship last year.  I wanted out and now after more reflection, I have reason to believe that this woman is not the first he's cheated on me with....but I can guarantee she was the last.  I want nothing to do with him ever again.  I even let him keep our home (after taking my share of the equity) that I loved so much - I just wanted away from him for good, as he abused me in many ways for too many years.  I deserve so much better and will not ever go back to that kind of life again.So, I casted the IC after my appointment tonight to see what that was all about and got 15.6>52.  The only thing I can take away from this is that he is still unsettled, his soul is uneasy (perhaps because I'm not pining away for him as he had hoped?) and that perhaps it was a reminder to me how far I have come and how much peace I have found in my soul?  Any insight would be helpful, as I'm still dazed and confused as to why a man who is madly in love with someone would waste his time eight months into this relationship by parading her in front of an ex-girlfriend?  I'm also confused as to why she would want to go along with it as well - wouldn't she wonder if he's still pining away for me instead of paying attention to her?  If I were her, I'd think that way.  Regardless, it's childish and for a man who is 41 years old and she, nearly 50 years old, it's time to grow up.  Apparently, I'm the only one here who has moved on in the last eight months.  (And for those of you confused about this situation and who this man is, it isn't Terry, the gentle soul whose ex-wife did the same to him.  We're still friendly, flirtatious and he's still trying to figure things out...)Last edited: May 27, 2010"

1158,"Four years ago my child rented a university accommodation that turned out to be just short of a death trap.  She had to call nearly every day for the first several months just to keep door locks working and appliances running.  Periodically the electric shuddered and lights dimmed.  Other times the electric  just wouldn't work at all.  As she was in the same city she did most of her laundry at home since nothing operated and on nights that there was no electric she just stayed at home with her roommate sharing in with friends.  Their food was ruined by a fridge that stopped functioning and so forth.  Her roommate went to school and held a job so, by default, my daughter was the only one available to call day after day for help -- calls that were mostly recorded at the university offices and ignored. About two months into the lease, my daughter was at the school accomodation drying her hair and heard someone screaming over the sound of the drier.  Her roommate had come home, started making food on the stove and walked briefly into her bedroom to change, leaving her mobile phone in the kitchen.  When she tried to leave the bedroom, the door handles fell off and she was trapped.  By the time my daughter heard the screams, the pan in the kitchen was on fire.  It was three hours before university authorities sent anyone to reach the trapped girl and she became hysterical.  The following week my husband and I were to go out of the country on holiday when my daughter called in a panic, the electric had shut down completely and there was a strange odour throughout the building.  We called the fire company, who refused to go saying it was university property.  Finally the electric company agreed to go and found that the wires had set fire and fused together in the mains box with further melting/fire travelling up some of the wires.I removed my daughter from the student accommodation and thus began a protracted argument with the University housing authority because I said she would not be living there during the second semester and in my estimation all agreements were cancelled.  We argued by mail for a month, then I simply wrote to the university provost about what was underway.  He fired the accomodation manager.  We heard one further time from the finance officer for the school and explained what had transpired.  He said that he would investigate and, if he needed anything further from me, he would be in contact.We never heard from him again.  Even when we moved out of the country we had our mail forwarded and there were no follow up messages from him.  Now, four years later, we are mysteriously in receipt of a letter demanding a semester's rental payment and saying we have been contacted multiple times and, since we didn't answer, prepare for a lawsuit if we don't send the money in 72 hours. First, it's not true that we were contacted before.  Second, it was a travesty in the first place and we owe nothing to them.Anyway, I will answer the letter tomorrow, probably by telephone, but before I do, I wanted to know from the IChing, ""What is the best way to handle this situation?""The casting:  Hex 26.1.6 changing to Hex 46.  The 1 changing line seems completely opposite the 6 changing line, as the first seems circumspect and the sixth to be quite animated and active.  So one is saying WAIT and the other to CHARGE AHEAD?The first would indicate to me that maybe these people are just trying this on?  Maybe the lawsuit business is rubbish?  I don't know what to relate this to.  I do know that the universities here have had their funding reduced drastically, so maybe any old claims they think they can drive home are fair game?The outcome Hex 46 seems positive enough -- says over and over not do worry or doubt, all resolves to the good.  Still, the question was ""What is the BEST way to handle the situation""?  So it's looking like, stop -- but also go ahead briskly.  Anyway, I'm stuck on this one."

She is the fiancé of one of the employees here. I liked her and the communication was very easy. Also she seems a very smart person and when I saw her the things she has to do , she actually were very quick to grasp them. We have agreed to start from Monday. First to help me finish some delayed projects and then being responsible for some of my current duties. Because I got a strange restless feeling which I can’t detect from were exactly it comes from I ask Yi. ( perhaps the relationship with the other employee worries me or a recent bad experience from another person)“X as an employee here. What do I need to know? “ 45.6 >12 Hmm, doesn’t look very nice , no ? Although Wilhelm say the alliance at the end is achieved, does Yi says to be prepared for some difficulties at the beginning ? could be 12 read as temporary separation , or as the alliance I’m seeking for or just as a more general difference of interests Any thoughts ?Thanks in advance,Maria"

1167,"So wrote Pablo Neruda in Poem 20. It applies perfectly to my case, as I'm apparently still struggling to get over the very short relationship I shared a few readings about a couple of weeks ago.The interpretation of those readings was discussed on here and left some aspects open, however I was reluctant to ask the Yi again as the overall message appeared quite clear, at least about the current status of the relationship (I'm no longer in touch with this person). I only gave in to the temptation to consult the Yi on this subject again once, to receive a response consistent with the previous ones and hence not requiring any additional insight. Needless to say the thought keeps coming back. In addition, I have been invited by a friend  to consider a different view of this situation. As a result, I have recurred again to my wise guide with the following questions. When I started I was not intending to ask a few, I just followed my impulse after the first - I sincerely knew I could rely on the Yi's patience and gentleness with slow learners like me.  I don't know if the questions were appropriate - they came out spontaneously, and I think their value lies really in the meaningful answers received.I am adding my brief gut interpretation of the responses very vaguely based on Wilhelm's translation and some related threads on here. They will most likely be superficial and possibly mistaken... anyone's help in having them right will be as usual appreciated.1. Dear Yi, please show me an image of my situation with x.32.1 > 34I guess I am being kindly ""told off"" for being stubborn in expecting duration from something which only had a hasty beginning and was soon over...2. What are x's feelings for me now? 11.3,4 > 54Looks like he is no longer resentful (Peace), maybe there is even some kind of affection, but 54 does not appear promising.3. Did x ever have feelings for me?6.2,4,5,6 > 2Never received so many changing lines! To me this speaks of an inherent conflict, as in basic differences between our personalities, intentions and expectations of our relationship, inevitably resulting in mutual mistrust. Maybe hex 2 refers to some feelings on his side, although I tend to interpret this more as his desire for someone submissively accepting his ways.4. Is there anything else I need to know about this situation with x?59.0Dissolving... The Yi couldn't have been more loud and clear. What a great hex for the final response!As a side note, hexagrams 6 and 59 are recurring from the previous readings... as if they summed up the situation.Thanks in advance for your precious insights :bows:CrisLast edited: May 12, 2010"

1169,"hello. I was involved in a relationship with a girl for about two months, she had just gone out of a longer relationship and I felt caught in the middle. After a while she decided she still loves her old partner and want to get back with him. This made me very sad but I accepted because if she loves him I wished them to be happy together. I did not hide that I still had strong feelings for her but I respected her decision, only now she has come back and realized her wanting to revive her old love was caused more by nostalgia for what the relationship used to be like. She now wants to be with me, but I have tried my best to contain my emotions and move on, and now I am not sure anymore that I want to get back with her.I asked the I ching what would happen if I got back with her and got 30.2.>14. I was tempted into asking again - how would I be affected if I don't get back with her and was answered 52.2.3>4. I read the first answer as telling me to hold on to my love (passion, fire) which will lead to great posession, especially the second line ""Yellow light. Supreme good fortune"".As for the second answer I'm not sure, I read the changing lines (2 and 3) in mountain warning against trying to fight something bigger than you (love?) and smothering a fire that will turn to suffocating smoke. However the lines change into youthful folly and there lines 2 and 3 warn against weak women who cannot decide? (no offence to any ladies).My heart is sending me conflicting messages, I don't know where to go. I'm sure you will see things that I don't.."
1170,"I just graduated from college, lack funds, and do not currently have a ""grand plan""; I simply want to take a break, reflect a bit, work, and figure out my next move.

I asked:What about moving back into my parents' house?:Hexagram 18.4 to 50A bit taken aback, I thought about it and it made sense to me. I then asked, How to respond to ""what has been spoiled by father""?:Hexagram 23.6 to 2I feel it would be more challenging, but more beneficial for myself to stay where I am settled and work hard to stay here (as I just graduated, I'll no longer receive any financial support from my 'rents). I admit to having feelings that by moving back home, I might be able to have a positive influence on my family, who seem to be experiencing rather tough times (my sister and grandparents also live in my hometown). This outlook increasingly seems to have little validity though. It would hopefully be ""only for a certain period of time"" but everyone I speak to says, ""Don't go back! You'll just get sucked in!"" and I'm beginning to agree after a recent visit home.So then I asked, What about staying in ____ rather than moving to _____(parents' house):Hexagram 14.1.2.3.4.6 to 2So, two relating hexagrams of #2 (and I've received that as a relating hexagram probably 7 times in the last 2 weeks..)I am really leaning towards staying in my college town where I feel more settled now.

1172,"As the footie fans on this forum know very well, tonight there will be the Championsleague final between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.

Maybe there's a hint that the team will lack the unity required to put in place it's playing tactics.9.3 as the fan yao reads:The spokes burst out of the wagon wheels.Man and wife roll their eyes.Wilhelm's commentary on this line is perfect for the question: Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness that the obstructing power is slight. But since, under the circumstances, power actually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive is doomed to failure. My take is team X will not win. The interpretation based on Shao Yung's method (which I used to cast the reading) confirms this negative outcome through consistently conflicting relationship between the hexes' trigrams.Anyone care to give it a try?  I'm going to disclose which team X is after the match "

I feel that this person is the love of my life.  We are in different places as far as our relationship goes, but I still feel like we have so much more to experience together as a couple.  My question was basically, what do I need to do to get my ex-girlfriend back?  I guess I mean, what sort of attitude do I need to adopt, what should be my plan of action to bring about a reunion.  The answer I received was Hexagram 50 'The Cauldron' with lines 1, 5, and 6 changing into 43 'Breakthrough'.  I also asked simply 'Will we get back together?'  and received Hexagram 38 with line 3 changing into 14.

1179,"Hello,Not at all sure - seemingly no breeze pushing me in either direction decision-wise, just lots of ifs and buts. I am currently teaching English to 8-11 year olds. It's fine. I'm definitely riding the waves ok. Sometimes it's good fun, other times I feel like I'm messing things up. It's hard to gauge whether I'm any good. There's no feedback or evaluation about our teaching (a pretty slack school really in that respect - not that bothered about what we're doing...). I'm enjoying the lifestyle though - meeting new people, travelling, being in China, working part time - but I'm pretty broke too! I've been offered a contract teaching in the city of Ningbo - seems like a great place to live and slightly more money - but it's for a year and the teaching sounds more pressurized (I'm not sure my teaching standards will be good enough for the rich parents sending their kids to me for extra tuition!) But the people there sound great, I've emailed teachers already there for info, seems pretty trustworthy, and a conscientious school. There also may be an opportunity to get a writing gig as one of the teachers at the school is also a magazine editor! So that's a big pull. But I also know that teaching is not for me long term - so perhaps one year wouldn't be a good idea? I just don't want to go home, and I don't have a plan B. Basically I have no idea! I have about another week to decide I think. I'm also still looking around at other vacancies, but with the magazine opportunity here maybe it'd be best for me (I'm going to email the editor to find out what might be available to me).I asked for a general diagnosis of me and teaching: (today I had 3 good-ish lessons and one lack-lustre one.)6.2,4,5 > 23Hmm... eek. Grating? Deteriorating? Or maybe I need to... let go? Not fight it? Maybe I am fighting with it rather than it with me? I just don't know if I'm... following the right path for my 'talents'. The lessons in this new job would also be longer - so the lesson plans would need to be more thorough, although it might make class more relaxing (feel like I'm cramming at the mo with 45 min lessons) - but I also have no idea, if I have my head around teaching! But there would be a month of training with them prior to starting...Go home/Plan B? (move away from teaching)53.2,3,5>4Could this be saying that I need to work harder on advancing where I am at the mo - ie with teaching - and that there's more to learn and that can only be successful through experience? I'm sure I'd get job satisfaction working in a school with high standards - more motivation perhaps. Or that finding out what you can/should do is a slow process? Great, but what to commit to now!!???Would working in this school and location be a good opportunity creatively? (considering the opportunity to contribute to the magazine)31.3,5 > 15Does this reading suggest I shouldn't run after this just because it seems attractive? Or to trust my gut instincts, but maybe play down my expectations? Hex 31 is generally about a good, inspirational and creative influence though isn't it?My main reservations are the low-ish wages (although it is only part time so I could work a second job with it I think), and their high expectations of their teachers. Also, if you want to leave you have to work a 3 month notice and there being a penalty fee because of expenses to the school. But then I suppose if I was terrible they'd just ask me to leave! I've also been told also that the parents get involved - ie expect to see their childrens' progress through a presentation given by the students and teachers every few months or so. Eek! Don't know if I'm up to it! Feel like I only want to/can scratch the surface of teaching at the mo! But maybe it'd be good to commit; get deeper into it? I just don't know how capable I am to develop in this sphere! And like I said, it is not my life vocation, I'm sure. But it feels worthwhile, and it's good to challenge yourself, and like I said, I have no idea what else to do! And the lifestyle's pretty good.... Thanks for reading and any advice will be so appreciated!Em  :bows:Last edited: May 18, 2010"
1180,I am new to the site but have worked with the Yi ching for many years.   I am not a scholar like many here seem to be but I can often work intuitively with the Yi.After 25 years of marriage to a wonderful woman who meets many of my life needs I am feeling the pull for a new direction.  We manifest on the earth plain fantastically but do not fulfill the tender places in each other hearts  we both desire and deserve. We both recognize this.  I have now met a woman that  has touched my heart in the ways I have been missing.  She and I have agreed not to have contact with each other until I sort out my life.  Last night I asked about the love I felt for this woman.  The response was Hexagram #1 Heaven with all six lines moving to #2 Earth.  Just a big wow was all I could say.Help if you can

So I thought I could ask for your help in interpreting this answer.I asked: how is it going to be next week at work? 23.2 was the answer.Well, I work in a place with two more people (Yi don't say good things about 3 people, I remember that!). Both are the owners of the place, and they are a married couple. Lately it seems that the man is if not in love, at least interested in me. I'm not interested at all, since he is married and a lot lot older than me. And worst, his wife works with us everyday. I am a foreigner, so I thought that maybe my ways of expressing myself made him feel like I was interested, because I am quite easy going and accept diferences very easily and play with them as a way of adaptation. Also, because I was being myself, since he was being himself from the beginning.This week it was very difficult, because I had the impression his wife and him had a huge argument, because he was shut in his room and not friendly as he usually is. I felt like working in a place about to explode. That's the worst feeling ever! Even worst when you think it's your fault. I feel like leaving, but I don't really know what to do. I haven't got any other job until now, and I have been applying for jobs for about 4 or 5 months, and nothing.So I asked: What should I do to deal with these problems at work?

1198,"My most recent readings about my relationship with my ex have been very profound. I'd like to share them and see what the community thinks. As background, see these threads:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?p=111128http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?p=113513In my most recent readings, the Yi speaks very clearly that nothing can develop for us right now and I must go forward on my own. But I am curious about previous readings that imply there is still a strong connection and hope for us that I should recognize and not lose sight of. Is there a contradiction here, or am I just looking at different levels of time -- what is happening now, and what might be possible in the future?How do I proceed with X?52.3.4.5 > 8This feels like a suggestion to be calm, not attempt contact or communication. But 8 ""Grouping"" has always seemed to me like an indication of a positive outcome for getting back together in the future -- am I reading this correctly?What about giving up on my relationship with X?46.2.3.6 > 56Wow, this one is intense. I use Karcher's translation primarily. Obviously the resulting hex ""Sojourning"" suggests I'm going to be alone for now. But I am trying to figure out the changing lines which say ""Do not stop now, have no doubts, etc..."" -- does this mean do not give up hope on the relationship, move through the ""darkness""? Or do they mean I should continue on my own path without looking back on the relationship I have been focused on for so long? It seems more the former than the latter, but I am biased in what I want to read in this.What is the nature of our relationship right now?6.4 > 59This one really struck me. Very clearly I feel the Yi saying I need to stop all attempts at influencing her, at rekindling the relationship. The ""quiet your heart"" line in Karcher is very meaningful for me in this situation, it's been brutal. But I do feel a sense in line 6.4 of ""waiting for something to return""... this is of course interesting for me. There seems to be hope in this line within context of my question.Is pursuing a relationship w/ X the best thing for me?45.3 > 31Wow -- loud and clear. But how am I to understand this in relation to the other readings above (and others I've received in the past months) which indicate a possible reunion for us? Is this simply advice for ""right now, and the others remain valid? Also, what about Hex 31 here -- does it seem like a suggestion of future reunion?I appreciate all the help this community has provided me during this incredibly difficult process. These most recent readings feel like the ""tough love"" answers I need to hear right now to get back on my path and move forward in my life. But it is important to me to know if the Yi is still suggesting a future with this person down the line, despite the obvious need to go on alone for now. Any insights are deeply appreciated...Blessings,ST"

1201,"Hello all,I cast a reading some time ago March 7th to try and help me make a decision between 2 different courses (each 4 years long).  The most important thing for me is that the training gives authentic results in healing & a treatment/practice that I value & trust.  And that I am engaged & trusting of the content.  At the time I was more drawn to the Rosen Method  for which I asked if this would be a good path for me - and got 7 with lines 2 and 3 leading to 15.  I was also very drawn to the Barbara Brennan Healing training but it was a more costly and difficult path in terms of location.  For that path I got 23, lines 1, 2 and 5 leading to 61.  I have tried many different paths without much training but its now time to find a true professional training.  I am now more drawn to the BB training as I am wanting to learn more about energy - but from all that I have read over the weeks, it would seem that the I Ching recommends the Rosen Method more than BB.  Would you agree?  An underlying current is that I feel a kind of urgency as my husband is leaving & I will lose my job/house and feel panicky as in another reading I asked about.  I really appreciate your help."

1204,"I paid some attention to an area of my house that I had ignored for the past six months - the front door.  I cleaned off the pollen and cobwebs, shook out the welcome mat, wiped down the door and added a green, happy plant to the right of the door.  Curious of the positive Chi that would be flowing there now, I asked the IC ""What will come as a result of the changes I made at the front door?"" and received 26.2.3.6>24.  I take the 26's lines to mean that recent changes would bring about better things, but there must be a period of waiting to see the result.  Kind of a ""reap what you sow"" mentality.  Makes sense, but the 24?  What's returning?Since the IC has this knack of getting around my words to what's on my mind, the first thought that popped in my head when reading the 24 was Terry.  This is the fella that has my attention, but has remained distant due to his own issues with relationships.  We're still friendly and at times flirtatious, but we're nowhere close to what I'd consider in a relationship at the time being.  Could it mean that he's what will be 24'ing?  Or is this about health or wealth?  I appreciate your help into how you'd read this as well.  Thanks so much!"
1205,"It doesn't get any cooler than this, IMHO.  I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism six months ago and have progressively been getting more ill - until I discovered a connection with how I take my meds and my diet.  I feel like a completely different person now that I'm doing everything right, including cutting out soy in my diet (which prohibits the thyroid hormone from being absorbed into my system).  I have also started working out nearly daily and I am already seeing results of my hard work in the gym.Out of curiosity, I asked the IC ""How will my health be for the remainder of this year?"" and got 27.3, Nourishment changing to 22, Grace.  I thought this was incredible, as I believe the IC is telling me to keep focused on my diet and that the superfluous exterior isn't as important as what's inside (a/k/a my health).  I found it ultimately ironic that the primary hex was nourishment, which has become my primary focus in the past week and has been the key to my health - looks like it'll continue to be the key, eh?"

1210,"Hi allI would appreciate any help regarding my reading.From January 2008, there was a leak because one of the water pipes was broken. Because it was bared in the ground we couldn’t see it and we find it out when the bill for that period was mailed to us. That happened ( with a lot of delays) on October 2008. Immediately we fixed it and went to the Water company which is Public ( belongs to the Mayor City) to solve the matter. Part of the responsibility is ours , because they say that we have to check the counting machine , although is something nobody does it, unless a problem occurs. But a big part of responsibility is to the company because its their responsibilities to send the bill to inform us if something goes wrong. The problem was obvious because when for 20 years we spend 400 lt , the most and suddenly the consumption reach to 1500-1700 cm3 then There is a problem. Also because of a campaign to save water, the company had to send letters to citizens that spend much water and I know that many people have received those letters.Anyway , we made a complain to the director of the Water company and because we saw that she tried to avoid any responsibility he had to go to the mayors office. The Major showed that he realized the things when wrong from their side and asked some time to give us an answer. Few days ago, we received a letter saying that we ought money and the amount is the same as the initial bills. The only reduction they have made is the money they added as a delayed payment interest. In other words they did nothing. I asked Yi “ what is the best way to proceed toward the resolution of the matter “ and got 46. My first impression is that I have to go straight to the Mayor. Its funny because his office is one floor up from the water company and since a image of 46 is stairs I thought Yi says “go upstairs"" yes? Based on that interpretation I gave, I also asked “ What best to say to him” and got 38.2.4.6 > 24 Looking at Wiki Hilary comment re line 38.2 readsNot a planned meeting, nothing formal. No-one has said, ‘We must sit down together and have a serious conversation about this, because it’s of vital importance.’ (That wouldn’t be a good idea: ‘small affairs, good fortune.’)Click to expand...Well, this was exactly what I wanted to do but seems its wrong unless it says that to proceed by asking an informal meeting and not do any written claim and just talk “off the record” which might give him the chance to protect his employees and find a solution to our problem. This has confused me a bit and “can’t read” the other two lines. Given the situation , any thoughts about 46 and 38.2 ?ThanksMaria"

1213,"For everyone that contributed to the thread I started asking for insights about the situation with my missing friend (ex).an update: I decided to be brave and contact him and ASK directly for the PEACE I want to have between us.I wrote to him just, ""I want peace between us."" and then I opened my heart, told the truth and just asked for peace.That was this morning. I expect that if he replies it will take him a few days, I know him..he needs time.But I asked the Iching this evening: ""How IS he reacting to the mail I sent today?""And the answer just warmed my heart and made me smile:17.1.3 leading to 31 Line 1‘An official has a change of heart.Constancy, good fortune.Going out of the gates, joining with others, there is achievement.’Line 2‘Bound to the mature man,Letting the small child go.Following, there is quest and gain.Settling with constancy bears fruit.’By the way, He is an Aries, I am Leo.I find it interesting that according to two of the best astrologers I follow, May is a special month as Mars is in Leo. The time for creativity and true love. It's interesting that the title of his horoscope for this month is: ""A Deeper Story"" (considering I actually wrote a story about our experience and exposed myself, giving him a ""deeper"" truth) - And the title of my Leo Horoscope for the second half of this month is: ""There Will Be An Answer""."

1220,"Hi. I have been deliberating on whether or not to post this, because it feels like a weighty dream, one of great importance.  But I don't get it, and you all don't know me well.  Perhaps I'm overreacting.  I dreamed that I was visiting with my parents in our old home.  I was getting ready to leave when I looked up into the SW sky (from which tornadoes come in the midwest US where I live) and instead, there was a huge (I mean, like ten mile high) network of electrical power lines and poles.  It was menacing in the extreme.  I knew I'd had that dream before but hadn't remembered it.  Then I was transported in place to the southwest US.  There were still huge networks of powerlines, but this time, I understood that they were something like a matrix (as in the movie), there to guard and harness power for the elite, and to harm and keep the non-elite under control  I looked around and there were cliffs and canyons, and First People were able to slip under the radar.  They were extremely flexible and knew places to go where the ""network"" couldn't.  The power was dark, dry, almost giving off a kind of powder that was cancerous, threatening.  This dream bothered me for days.  I finally asked the Yi what it meant, and it said, 2.4 changing to 16.  I have to say that I really don't get it.Like most people, I have dreams, then I have Dreams.  This was a DREAM.The only thing I can think of would be that it must feel like this to the honeybees and the other critters that depend on electromagnetic readings to find their homes.  Then, we are filling the airwaves with our electricity, which is harming them.  But I don't see how 2.4 or 16 would have ANYTHING to do with this.  I'd really appreciate any help on this.:bows:"
1221,"Hi all,I’ld like to hear your thoughts about some readings I got. It has to do with a drawing class I attend and thinking of quitting. The good thing is that its close to my home, almost free ( a charge of 5euros for the whole session ) and very convenient in terms of time. What I don’t like is the work is done there. We are 9 people and 6 of them they just copy paintings from books and I’m the only one that wants to learn how to “see” colors and put them on the paper. ( the other two people use pencil and coal ). The teacher tries to find a balance but to me seems not enough. So every time , after the end of the lesson , I leave with an empty feeling. She is paid from the mayor office and its normal that she tries to keep a low profile and keep her job. There are those weird dynamics in such programs.Also there is no exchange at all. It seems that is forbidden to make any comments about others work ( even positive, lol). From words I have heard here and there must be some misunderstandings or fights in the past. ( I enrolled after 1 ½ months after the course started). In the past I was attending to some writing classes and with respect to the other’s effort constructive comments was a must. This is how one learns, imo. So, I asked Yi1. What if I quit? 51.1.2 > 40There is a sense of release at both hex and it makes sense to me because I go there with a heavy heart and I feel I force too much myself to do something that deep down I can’t find any joy. Another view is to release my self from those expectations .2. What if I keep going there ? 45.1.2.3.6 >1 The question behind the question is to find a reason, I don’t see now, to stay. How I can benefit from this classYi’s answer troubles me a lot. Funny when you ask for a group and get 45 for an answer, lol. And what bring this specific group together a creative expression. At a first glance reading the lines especially LiSe’ commentaries, I hear Yi telling me “make it work” What is your impression re those readings. Am I missing something ? How would you read it ?

1228,"Hi,Anyone that read the other thread about my situation and relationship will have the background to this question already.At the end of the discussion, Trojan gave some concise advice..or more, a very accurate observation. This has lead me to try to ask different questions, to  understand myself better..and my own impulses and impressions.I mentioned in that thread that I was moved by yet another dream of my ""missing friend"". Previously, in the months before, when he was very bitter and angry towards me (and life in general I believe) I had three dreams in which he was very angry with me. Those didn't surprise me at all..as I knew he was angry so I saw it as a subconscious reflection of what I already knew.Then I stopped thinking of him that much for a few months. Most recently, not at all.Last week I dreamed about him again, but this time it was more profound, it was like the dreams I had of him in the past, always before a significant event (dare I say ""psychic"" dreams? I am no psychic though but with him..the dreams are of that nature)So, suddenly last week I dreamed of him but instead of anger it was beautiful. He came to me and told me ""things have changed in my life. Circumstances have changed. It's ok now, I'm not angry with you anymore."" Then he told me to look up a restaurant, he said ""find out the name of the city the restaurant is in"". So in the dream I looked it up and the name of the city was, ""Union"".I thought this was symbolically significant.Now, in an effort to understand why I am so bound to him, on an energetic soul level. I decided to ask ""What was that dream trying to tell me?It answered: 59.3.4 leading to 44I like Hilary's translation on the Hexagram:it is as if a great thaw brought the floods, and everything solid were swept away. All the walls – whether they divided, contained or sheltered – are goneClick to expand....The lines here are:Line 3‘Dispersing your selfWithout regrets.’Line 4‘Dispersing your flock,From the source, good fortune.Dispersing gains the hilltop,No barbarian has occasion to think of this.’Click to expand...This is my interpretation of the reading taking the context of the dream into consideration.He and I have been blocked by his anger and my fear. In the dream he said ""something has changed. It is OK now""I have had no news whatsoever from him so this information in the dream, could not come from ME. I believe it came from him. As other info about him has before via dreams.I see this as meaning that walls have dropped and a new energy has entered the situation. One that could lead to transformation. Also, that we both have reconnected to the source and by that, to our true selves?But why does that lead to 44? 59 seems spiritual a shift of energies, 44 seems so physical and primal. What is the connection between those two hexagrams here?The only connection I can see is that 59 speaks of energy flows and dispersal, dissolving of walls and borders and many other things...and Hilary's comment on 44 just happens to be: ""What would be an adequate response to this new energy?Click to expand..."

1230,"Hi guys, I have not posted for a while as I have gone into seclusion for a few months due to an apparent inability to improve things in my life and to move forward.Some of you may remember that for 2 years now since my split from the father of my son I have been trying to move on and provide stability and peace for me and my son, a process effectively interfered with by my ex partner's obsessive refusal to let me go, by my own insecurities and feelings of guilt and worry about my son.  It feels like I have arrived at this point of time on all fours, exhausted by fear and stress.  This has got to be the turning point as it surely cannot carry on any longer.Although I have made attempts in the past to move on (eg. moved out of the town where my ex lives to a place 2 hours drive away) I only found that the same nightmare has been moved with me.  My ex still continued to apply pressure for us to get back together, becoming agressive and abusive every time I refused to consider reconciliation.  I have considered a restraining order in the past but never carried it through as I thought we will be able to build a relationship as parents and friends for the sake of our son.  I am going to see a lawyer tomorrow to get advice regarding legalising my ex's contact details with my son and to discuss the restraining order if necessary.  Because this process has been going on for so long I have become very overprotective of my little boy and am now very anxious to let him stay overnight with his dad (line 2 describes this quite nicely?) due to my ex's outbursts of bullying and verbal abuse in the past.I have cast this hexagram to try and find an answer regarding the best course of action right now, i.e. a drastic action like a restraining order to stop my ex controlling my life or more of a softly approach i.e. trying to get on with him and see if we can come up with an agreement for his contact with Oli (my ex wants 50-50 custody where I just want him to have contact rights i.e. take Oli away at alternative weekends)I am not sure what the advice really is here...

1233,"I'm currently scraping by trying to finish up my BA in history (1 week to go!). Just the fact that I'm describing the completion of my 4 year degree thusly might help key you in to my current situation. This has been a tough semester, and i've found it increasingly difficult to stay focused on my academic studies throughout the past year and a half or so. I've been losing interest and often found myself questioning my major and what I'm doing in college, but at the same time feeling I must persevere and finish out my degree.My grades aren't good, and I'm at a ""make it or break it"" point in the last week here to simply make sure I graduate.

I feel perfectly capable of this, yet I'm finding it strangely and almost agonizingly difficult just to make it through these last papers/exams. I'm getting burnt out, frustrated with my subjects, and have been pulling too-many all-niters to function at 100%. I'm finding I'm certainly not the studious student I was just a few years ago.I asked ""How can I navigate the next week of my academic studies?"" and received Hexagram 54.A little tough to swallow, this one always is, and also a toughie for me to interpret clearly.What is your reading of this? Thank you,fr"
1234,"Question: ""how do i maximize my chances of getting X?""60.1.2.4.6 > 12aside from the 4 changing lines (confusing), does this mean that even my best bet course of action (60) will still meet failure (12)?ORdoes it mean doing 60 will end in failure, BUT another course of action may have another outcome? so its actually a warning NOT to do 60?"
1235,"Hi allAfter my initial reconnection with IC and a rather torrential period of casting, I decided to take a step back and try and ponder and analyse the readings I got only casting once at a time. I still have problems deciphering the huge depth and wealth of information but have come to the conclusion that I should trust my initial views and with time and experience deeper understanding will come. I have also started a journal of my castings so I can look back and see whether my interpretations were insightful or whether I was completely off the mark.So this brings me to today's casting. To give a bit of background after 2 years of 3monthly contracts I have been given a years contract at my place of work where I really enjoy going to work everyday probably for the first time in a long time. This has eased my stress levels tremendously as I can now start placing some roots and get my life back in order as I have been living out of a suitcase for the last 4 years.Also my friendship with woman who I first posted about has moved on and is more relaxed now. And I have another close female friend too so life is looking quite relaxed and positive.I am due to go on holiday to Mongolia next week, meeting up with S. in Berlin for couple of days, and wanted to see an image of current situation. On asking ""Please show me an image of my situation""  received 51.1.4 -> 2.My perception is that this will be a shocking and scary to start as I have never been to Berlin and speak like German, also will be independent for some of the time due to S. family commitments but it will will be a fun time through the rest of holiday. Line 1 I can understand, and see it as being about going out and challenging myself to see and do things, which I will enjoy once the effort is made. But Line 4 I am having trouble with. From LiSe, my reading is unless you allow yourself to be shocked life will be very dull.And the resulting Hex2 is to be receptive to the whole experience(s) along the way.Of course I could be completely wrong!  Look forward to you thoughtsRegardsTom"
1236,"Ok, so we undoubtedly reached adulthood a while back, yet our life companion has not shown up yet. I usually wonder whether in my case he’s hiding on the other side of the world (Amazonia? Tasmania?) just to make sure we don’t run the risk of bumping into each other! Surely there’s something to do about it? Time to consult the IC…So following again this website’s suggestions I asked:“How do I need to change in order to attract my soulmate?”The answer was 15.6 > 52.Modesty… hmm… how evocative. The JudgementModesty creates success.The superior man carries things through.The ImageWithin the earth, a mountain:The image of Modesty.Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,And augments that which is too little.He weighs things and makes them equal.To me the hexagram appears to speak of the ability to see oneself objectively, and to work on one’s own weaknesses (the too much’s and the too little’s). Moderation maybe, other than modesty? Rings a bell… I have often been described as “extreme”, so I guess the Yi is saying I should try to avoid my black and white views and become better balanced. This would be perfectly confirmed by 52, Keeping Still – finding my “centre”, inner silence and peace of mind.In a less intimate interpretation, the Yi might be talking about any imbalance in my life – for instance work’s importance as opposed to family and personal interests. I wonder whether it could be even referring to physical appearance?... (“He weighs things…”).Six at the top means:Modesty that comes to expression.It is favorable to set armies marchingTo chastise one's own city and one's country.This line suggests that modesty and strength need not be opposite, and conquests can be made without being aggressive – a good reminder for a single working woman. It also seems to invite me to start my “campaign” from the home front – a confirmation of the above. LySe offers another angle to Hex. 15: “Give and Take”, team-words, cooperation. Substituting ‘words’ (part 1 of the character) for ‘bird’ gives Jian1, a mythical bird with one wing and one eye. Two of them could fly: the perfect cooperation. Who has the gift of qian can fly to higher places than he would ever be able to reach on his own.which to me sounds like the perfect omen for finding my soulmate.These are just my modest two cents  Any other input would be very helpful!"
1237,"Hello again,as per my last thread, I'm waiting to hear about a big project, there's another one too and the combination would sort a lot of things out for me. In the meantime, my financial situation is completely terrifying! I asked for a picture of my financial situation: 48:3 to 29well no suprises there, it really is a picture of my financial situation, feels very 29ish indeed! My sense with 48:3 is that its telling me I haven't been careful enough with my money, and I need to sort out a lot of stuff so that the well can be drunk from again, 29 is the consequence, so its really a call to action, to get myself out of the pit?The second project I'm waiting for has been put on hold for a week or so, and I'm waiting to hear from them. I asked, what is likely to happen with project y? 10:6 to 58.Seems to be reminding me again that I need to be careful with how I do my work, to look at what I've achieved so far, but the outcome looks good generally.I'm hoping that the combination of these readings means I won't be i the pit for ever!!!!What do you think, am I missing anything?E"
1238,"Perhaps this hexegram upsets me because the translations of it seem overwhelmingly negative.I got 23.2.3 changing to 18 Repairing what has been spoiledtoday after asking about an action I made to clear the air and come to a new understanding with an ex. I wrote a short story based on our relationship and what happened and published it. The reviews were excellent, people wrote to me telling me howtouched they were by it...men and women alike. The story is about an elderly woman, recalling an affair of her youth. It is an obvious allegory for my relationship with my ex lover.I had two male friends tell me, ""There is no way he could read that and not be touched.""He has thought, that I betrayed him but the truth is not what he thinks.I feel now that he has read the story, just this week in fact. A mutual friend sent it to him.I asked the iching IF  he read it and it answeredI got 23.2.3 changing to 18 Repairing what has been spoiledMy initial reaction to this hexagram is to be upset. I almost started to cry. There is no way to read the story and be angry or upset. We split ways one year ago, time has passed and I wrote about him with enormous love. I can't post the story here because it would reveal my identity.I am hoping that the answer is speaking to me about what happened in the past, what the past situation has been (it was definitly so 23) but this past week I had a dream about him. He came to me and held me and said ""everything is ok now"".Is this Hexagram saying that he read the story and is angry and splitting even further away from me?I asked: How will it (the truth/the story) eventually effect his view of me, of us and what will happen?It answered 42.1.3 Increase Leading to 53 A steady paceLast edited: May 8, 2010"

Here is what I understand : I will have a new opportunity, a new beginning. It will be a subaltern situation and I will not be recognized as a valuable employee, at least in the beginning. Success will come later (35).Well, I am not sure of my interpretation. Maybe this could mean that I will stay unemployed as my qualifications won't be recognized and if I keep a positive thinking success will come ultimately.Hey guys, I could use some of your wise view on this.

1242,"Hi,My friend's girlfriend has ended their 2 years love relationship a few weeks ago. My friend is a bit shocked and has hopes of them getting back together, although she moved back to her country since to pursue a bohemian career / way of life. Wanting to know if this break is for good or not, I asked the IC :""From now on, what forces are at work in this relationship?""21.1.3.6>62The lines seem to be talking about her and the choice she's made. How does this answer my quetion about this break being for good or not?Thanks :bows:"
1243,"Hello all,Could really do with a little help here. I am currently living in China teaching English to children which I have overall been really enjoying although I don't feel I'm the best teacher and that I'd want to do it forever! However at the moment it's a way to earn money (well not enough to save on my current salary but basic needs covered), get work experience, travel, meet people and explore a country that holds much interest for me not least because of the I Ching.My current position ends in July and I am seriously considering committing to another year teaching, but in another location in China and for a higher salary. Last week a job came up that I felt really enthusiastic about. However, this past week was a holiday and we returned for teaching on Thurs and Fri only. I was v tired and also, for the first time really, felt I didn't want to be stood up there teaching. And children are so perceptive! If your energy, enthusiasm and sincerity are down they can tell!! So the last couple of days of teaching have not been great, and I feel quite ambivalent about my life/direction, but still that I want to see more of China and that it doesn't make sense to go home (no plan B to speak of and it'd be good to make some money at it).I had the interview yesterday but was not able to be my best on the phone due to lack of teaching enthusiasm this week, and am not sure I'd be the best for the job although I was offered it. It would be in Ningbo - one of the best sounding cities here and a good starting point for places in the South I want to visit. I was warned however that I would be in a group of about 25 other foreign teachers in Ningbo, of whom I would be the youngest and only 3 are girls. However he said there was a lot to see and do there, entertainment and culture wise. I also mentioned my interest in creative writing and we even talked about getting a group going as they're creative people etc. Sounds good. But at the same time, the pay isn't great as you have to pay for your accommodation (better than here though), but primarily I wonder at my teaching interest/ability. I also am not sure how it'd be socially but that's always pot luck so am not too worried about it I asked the I ching for a reading after the phone interview60.4,5 - 54I then asked whether I should just do it4.4,6- 40I later asked should I reject this offer? (I said I'd confirm either way by Monday)18.1-26It would be a year commitment and wouldn't start until Sept which suits me well as it'd allow me to go home for a month before beginning. It also is only part time hours.I have thoughts on these readings and especially reading Lise's interpretations has helped (and he uses the subject of teaching to describe hex 4!) But as I said, I feel completely suspended here with no internal wind pushing me in either direction Thanks so much for any help and for reading!!Em :bows:"
1244,"Hi,My husband and I split over 12 months ago, he picked up with another woman straight away, I was heartbroken and cut off all communication between us except once to discuss our sons school fees.Over the 12 months my husband still chose to ring me and be quite horrible and if I didn't answer wld leave a nasty msge, until I got the police to step in and that brought a stop to it. Now again I will get a phone call and whoever it is hangs up on me, recently I found out it was him but chose to let it go. He is still with his new partner and as he isn't abusing me just hanging up so I have let it go.Recently my son and husband had a run in over his schooling so my husband rang me leaving a msge which was neither bad nor good. My son was very upset about the exchange he had had with his dad so I intervened thro txt msge to his father even though I really don't wish for contact, my sons well being comes first, nothing nasty, just stated the facts and mentioned what beautiful children we had and what a lovely job we had done bringing them up.  I hoped this wld just settle things down a bit but instead 2 days later my husband sends me a very, very nasty msge having a go at me personally and nothing really to do with the run in he had had with our son.I ask Ichingwhat is the cause of x's nastiness towards meI received  hex 32.2.4.5>39I am just starting to overcome this breakup of a long term marriage and get my life together on many levels so I wld love to know what is going on here.

1245,"Good morning everyone!As some of you will recall I recently started a thread about some money I could no longer find, and am still looking for... Now, a very similar experience took place again in my family. (I promise we are all usually quite attentive people ). I am spending a couple of days at my parents', and yesterday morning my father realised he no longer had his wallet with him. We looked for it around the house and in the car, even called the last shop he had visited the day before, but couldn't get a hold of it. He was getting very anxious - no big money in the wallet but id, driving license, credit cards, etc. so a lot of red tape ahead - and depressed as he could not remember anything about the previous night.So I asked the I Ching:""Dear Yi, please tell me, where is Dad's wallet?""Got 35 unchanging.I was not familiar with this hex (quite unfortunately I had not received it before ), however the first two lines of Wilhelm's translation were clear enough:35. Chin / Progressabove LI THE CLINGING, FIREbelow K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTHThe hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever widening expansion and clarity.Needless to say, I felt immensely reassured. Ten minutes after, while we were already on the phone blocking the credit cards, the wallet was found on the living room's bookcase. My happiness was twofold: all the family felt relieved, and the Yi had been right again! I thought I'd share this success with all of you.Have a great Sunday!Cris"
1246,"Hi all!I rarely ask questions like this as it never accurate for me anyways.But now there are decisions to be made, important ones, and I guess I need extra help, all the help I can get.So I askedWhat will happen to me in the nearest months?Got 45.1.3.5 => 55 ?????Grouping, accident, death ( based on Lise's site?)Any ideas? This time I do not even know what to think.Thank you!"
1247,"Help!I casted, but I'm in serious need of a venting session, and hope you guys don't mind.  I just got off the phone with my Mother, who has spent the last 32 years alone.  She dated briefly when I was an early teen (maybe 2-3 months), but since then, she returned to her ""anti-men"" mindset.  There are some VERY unhealthy attitudes here with her, ones that I'm trying to ensure I do not adopt through a lot of soul searching, reflection and therapy.She's not a happy person typically, but seems to perk up and get lively when she knows that someone else is miserable.  So, each time I speak with her, at least half of the conversation revolves around how the ex really screwed me and the second half is how ""nothing is ever going to evolve with Terry"".  I remind her that perhaps taking my relationship with Terry back to a friendship for now is the right thing to do for us.  Neither of us is ready at the current time for anything more serious.  (And let's not forget how none of my love life really is her business!)Once I tell her that I need time to find myself and that I'm not just going to go out and spend time with men that I'm not interested in, she replies with a ""but I'm not telling you to do that"".  Um, but you did just say that Mom.  You said that Terry and I are going nowhere and that I ""need to get out there, circulate and spend time with all sorts of men"".Most of my days and nights are spent working in my real estate business and I do go out with friends and socialize, but not on a weekly basis.  I have activities I'm involved with, I do community service through my volunteer work on a board of directors, so I'm not a total hermit.  But the truth be told, I don't hit the bars and go out with just anyone.  I'd rather be at home than be miserable on a date.  I believe that now is my time to heal, reconnect with myself and to let things unfold the way they should in my romantic life.  Each day I'm discovering and learning about things and getting emotionally healthier (which prepares me for a better relationship in the future).  But, ARGH!  Mom!  You're so dysfunctional, it drives me nutty!  Okay, vent over.  Thanks for listening/reading.  I asked the IC right after getting off the phone why Mom is so against a relationship developing between Terry and me and got 7.2.6>23.I think it's saying Mom (as leader) is out of touch with what's going on in my life and what's best for me.  I think it's also saying she's abusing her position in the family here and that 23 is telling me I need to cut away that that does not benefit me (her ""advice"") and remain calm.As a side note, earlier today I asked if Terry would be pursuing me again in May, and got 19.2.6>27.  I take that to mean that we are at a crucial point, chill out and don't rush anything...as this relationship will have what we both need to nourish us in a balanced way.  I think it could also indicate there's still a lot of work to do and/or one of us will always be the one to lead the way a/k/a pursue (probably me), but in the end this will be a relationship that could truly be one to bring us happiness.  I like that idea.I feel so much better sharing this with you.  Thanks for letting me rant!"
1248,"Hex 18 has been coming up a lot for me lately. In fact, just when I see a good answer, it changes to 18: Corruption. This hex seems to indicate some source of misfortune that I somehow bring upon myself. What is more, it mentions ancestors and honoring them, sayng that one's failure to do so may bring progress to a halt.I am naturally quite prone to depression and sometimes get so down / wrapped up in my own misery that I tend to be my one worst enemy. My mother, i.e. my closest ancestor is the same. Could this be a warning? Be more positive and practice positivity or let your life remain sad forever?"

1253,"Hi,I'm very new to the I Ching.  I've been consulting every day, but still have a hard time with the language and making sense of things.  I wonder if there are some general guidelines people might offer in how to make sense of what often feels like cryptic language.  Today I asked if I should let go completely of a romantic interest.  The brief backstory is that we met, hit it off, and started falling (in love? in somewhere, at least). Then he realized he couldn't do it, wasn't prepared for a serious relationship after a 6 year marriage, in which he lost himself.  Says he needs to be alone and learn how to be alone. Instead of running my usual rejection story, I'm choosing to believe him. He is heartful and loving and has assured me it's not about me (i.e. there was nothing about me per se that he didn't want). He just needs space. Anyway, I'm respecting his needs and it's turned out that not seeing each other is the least painful for both of us, tho' I have wanted to see him and wish to give myself a way of keeping it light, to enjoy the moment for what it is and not have to desire a serious relationship. Even tho' ultimately that is what I am looking for in my life. I have reaching and grasping tendencies and am working to not employ them. For my own well being as well as his.Today I asked ""Should I let go completely of A.?""  My hexagram was 59.  Dispersal.  No changing lines. Soften my ego, don't run my usual story.  And?Any specific guidance is welcome, as well as more general guidance on how to ""read"" the text. Thank you kind ones.K"
1254,"Hi there,I've been trying to cope with my challenging relationship for a while now, and after getting a bit freaked out about how things would progress (as those of you who were kind enough to look at my last post will know), and feeling simply exhausted and miserable about the situation, I decided to try Jesed's diagnostic questions. I'm at the point where I don't know whether to give up completely, let it go and move on, try to be friends with the possibility of it being more practically possible to make it work in the future, or just stay with it and not expect anything much right now. He's under enormous pressure, and trying to cope with lots of stuff changing, and I've been being supportive and trying not to ask too much. He's been struggling to find any time to spend with me at all, and I've asked him to try and make some space, which he has promised to do. I just don't know if he can and right now I don't know if its healthy for me to wait, or if I'm strong enough...It would be great if anyone has any thoughts:General diagnosis of the relationship between x and me: 10:2 to 25from huang ""this gua expounds upon the principle of ..fulfilling ones duty in a difficult situation"" . Is 10 about taking precautions? Not treading on the tiger's tail seems to be about mitigating a dangerous situation, but I'm not quite sure how. In Huang, 10.2 seems to be about being a recluse, stepping away from the world and the difficulty. Hmmm, and 25, all about honesty and truthfulness? My position to the relationship with x: 23:6 to 2I'm not sure if this is saying I should let go or that things are transforming and will eventually move into a new phase, so I should do nothing and wait...His position to the relationship: 29:3,5 to 46Well he's definitely in the midst of the abyss right now, and I imagine can't see a way out, 29:3 seems to indicate that there is nothing he can do right now, but 29:5 seems more hopeful of release. The image of growth and pushing upward in 46 does seem to indicate hopeful progression and being able to get stronger and more stable though.What is the best thing for me to do right now regarding x? 48:3,6 to 5948:3,6 - things aren't working right now, but the well isn't going anywhere and can be drunk from in the future? 59, dispersing: let go of it (again) or wait for the tension to release, the ice to melt?I'm not sure if I'm too close to this to be able to interpret effectively, which is suppose is also the way my emotions feel right now, I'm really stuck as to what to do. Previously my instinct was always to stay with it, but right now I'm not sure at all of the best way to go. All I know is that to let him go will be painful, and being here isn't much fun either!!

1255,"Thought I was done with this!  But no.  As the inertia drags on and on, I decided to do a conclusive reading -- one way or the other -- for the renowned ""relationship"" in my life. My last attempt at being ""radical"" didn't really work and seemed rather lame in the end.  Instead I was thinking, maybe forget the drama and just quietly walk away.  So I asked ""What happens if I just let this relationship go?""  The Yi gave me 2.3 changing to 15.  My reading of this was, to just let it go would have the greatest positive effect.  So, deep breath, resignation, just forget it, and go on.  Simple solution and I put down the coins and said, there, that's enough then.Minutes later, I drifted off to sleep and had the wildest dream about this guy.  The first time this has ever occured -- and I won't bore you with the details, suffice it to say quite steamy -- and not just ANY dream, but one of those very REAL ones where you wake up and it feels like it's still THERE in the room.  Rats.So I'm thinking, maybe i got 2.3 to 15 wrong; either that, or maybe my subconscious thinks this is very funny to play this dream now that I'm thinking it's settled.  Anyway, deciding to ask for clarification, I posed another question to the IChing:  Was this dream a premonition of the truth about this man?  -- since in the dream he was quite certain we should be together and left no room for doubt.  This time, I got Hexagram 12. 4.6 becoming Hexagram 8.  Which seems to say, this is a ""mandate,"" remove the block and get on with it, that if you push past the blockage, there is joy?  Then there is some sort of union or peace of mind in the future?  As Willow Fox has noted before, whatever is to get done to kick off the relationship [if there is to be one] seems to be my job.  He has been too reticent or afraid of something.  Is that the blockage?  OR, is wishful thinking the blockage and that was the thing to remove -- as I was thinking in the first place -- and get on with whatever comes next and ignore this dream?  Somewhere there is an end of this, one way or the other.  And I'd love to know where."
1256,"Hi,Just when I think something is sorted it has come back up to upset me yet again.I have just started a course at Tafe(adult education) and a student(male) and I became friends for study purposes only.Unfortunately he wanted to be more than friends and started harrassing me sexually and although I asked him to stop and ignored any further contact from him he continued to abuse me via txt msges and voice mail.So I did what we were taught to do in class and reported it to our head teacher.Unfortunately she dealt with it in a manner that said she didn't want to deal with it so as the contact did stop once she talked to him and all I really want to do is study to learn I let it drop rather than turning it into a major harrassment case.Unfortunately he told other students about it and for a couple of weeks I rec'd the cold shoulder from them which made it a bit uncomfortable but as they don't really matter to me outside of Tafe and we still managed to work together properly in class I thought it best to just let it work itself out.And so I thought it did and yday he sent me a msge asking if we could be on speaking terms again and I said yes but at Tafe only and breathed a sigh of relief.However he kept txting and ringing me but I chose to ignore it so consequently he sent to very abusive txts to me.I just want him to leave me alone and get on with my studying in a comfortable and harmonious environment.I don't trust the teacher so short of going above her head I have not reported it.So I asked the IChing -What is the best way to deal with the latest txt msges from xI rec'd Hex 51.2.4>19Please help me as I am near tears and just want to get on with things.My take on it is to just let it go and it will resolve itself but as I have already done this I am a bit hesitant.thkuMelissa"
1257,"Hello - my first post, although I have been following for some time.  My husband, who I love very deeply, is wanting to leave to follow the pull of his heart and cycle around the world, but without committing to coming back to me, as he doesn't know what will happen.  He wants to end up in his native NZ.  I understand his calling, but am holding back the grief & confusion and the fear as we work together in a job that also gives us accommodation - so I would lose all 3 not if, but when, he goes.  He hasn't decided when as he wants to make sure that I am ok and set up with some kind of plan & career training.  It feels frightening & yet I know its going to happen so I have to make plans.  Stating the obvious I suppose, I asked the I Ching for guidance ' it feels so chaotic with Paul's leaving plans, I don't know what to do or where to go.  Please could I have some guidance.' and it gave me 55 lines 2 and 6.  My initial fear was that it could see me in isolation for 3 years if I'm not careful..possibly because of being so fearful.  55 seems from all the threads to be about big life changes.. but it seems an awful prospect and now seems worse with line 6.  Please any help with this?  Hebe"

Here is a chart of the total hexes (first and second).I've gotten hex 15 the most.  Perhaps this is saying that I need to be more humble in my approach to the situation.

I got 15 unchanging.I also asked: What will be the effect of moving back home before my visa runs up? I got 35.5 > 12. At first I was like, YES! What a clear answer! Move back and you get progress, it's all good! UNTIL I got to the relating hexagram, 12 Stagnation.Like, what does that mean? Progress to stagnation? How frustrating! I've read archives, but I'm still confused. The road ahead just seems so nebulous!I then asked: What do I need to know about my life right now, or in the immediate future, that will have an effect on this situation?

1263,"I have become a bit confused by a series of discouraging impasses. I asked Yi, ""What should I do with regards to this situation?""The response was 3.2.3>5I am a bit confused by the message. Does this mean that I should wait for the right time to act, or that there is nothing I can do in the meantime?Line 3 seems to say I am lost and that my endeavor may not go well and even implies I should just give up altogether.Of course, hex 5 says to try to be patient.Am i supposed to do nothing and just ride out the impasse? Maybe line 2 is referring to me not asking for help in the past and then line 3 is suggesting that I would be better off with seeking outside guidance?Not sure how to piece this all together. Confusing."
1264,"Hi there,My partner and his daughter haven't been on speaking terms for around 5 years or so now. He would really love to rebuild their relationship and always sends her cards etc. for her birthday and at Christmas, but gets no response. I think she feels he's doing it out of duty, rather than because he wants to. From my point of view I gather it's more because he doesn't know what else to do, but I can totally understand it if she sees it this way. I thought that if he wrote to her it could help the situation. So, my question was - what would be the outcome if he wrote her a letter? I received 53.4.5>56My gut feeling was that it would be a positive step, but any progress made would be very gradual. Perhaps, if he was consistent in contacting her regardless of her lack of response, she may one day come round. I wasn't sure how to interpret 56, other than it being unfamiliar territory, although the idea of separation didn't sound too favorable. I would be really grateful if anyone could shed any light on the answer.Thanks in advance!"

1266,"Hello everyone, last monday something happened, at the beginning I thought it was really funny, but it's kept me thinking for the whole week. Last september, there was a meeting in my neighbourhood, a few days after that meeting someone I've known for a long time (our parents were neighbours and now we are neighbours too) told me that a guy who lives in the same neighbourhood and who was at the meeting liked me very much and he wanted to meet me. I thought it was funny and that my friend was exaggerating.Well, after all that, last monday, I was at home getting ready to watch tv and go to bed when the doorbell rang. At first I didn't answer but it rang again, so I asked and my friend answered, so I opened the door. Well, she was there with this guy and with a funny excuse related to my computer (he owns a computer shop and knows about computers). The situation was funny because he seemed shy and all that. I didn't know what to say, but I think that I was a good host.As you can imagine, and knowing myself... as I said, it has kept me thinking all the time... as I don't quite understand why o what is the purpose of this...Well, I asked a few questions and there they are:What does he think about me after the visit? (I shouldn't care but...) 42 (4) changing to 25. I think it is quite possitive, he has a good opinion about me.Why did he visit me? 53 (5) changing to 52. This, I don't know, 53 is gradual progress, which means because he wants to start getting closer to me?? but the 52 is keeping still, confusing, I don't get it.What is he going to do next? 2 (4) changing to 16, which I think line 4 means he is not going to do anything.What kind of future is there between us? 36 (1, 3) changing to 2. I am not sure, but after reading a lot of threads, does it mean that whatever happens will be kept secret or something like that?what should I do in this situation regarding him? I got 17 (6) changing to 25. Does it mean keep still and do nothing?And the last questions, sorry if they are too many... I have thought of going to his shop since I need something for the computer and since he came to offer help... I asked, what will happen if I go to his shop? I got 13 (1, 4, 5) changing to 52. Fellowship and then keeping still. Not clear.Thanks for reading, any insight will be really appreciated."

1269,"I'm having some problems establishing a long term relationship. I'm attractive and there are opportunities but nothing ever comes out of it or sticks. So I asked what are the chances of meeting someone to have a long term relationship with this year? I received Hexagram 41 unchanged which I interpreted to mean that I have to decrease something in order to increase something else. To clarify what it meant I asked:What do I need to decrease in order to increase my chances for a long term relationship?Hexagram 49 lines 1,3 and 4 changing into Hexagram 8I searched the forum but found nothing to help me interpret the meaning.

1271,"Hi everyone, I was looking to get some input on this reading. I had asked why this man feels and behaves towards me the way he does and received 8.2.4---47interesting. There is a possibilty that he likes me romantically but his behavior is very strange and difficult to read. His strange behavior is why I think he could like me, but i am definately not sure. I find it strange these two lanes change the hex into 47. The lines together would read for a very promising situation but how does exhaustion/oppression fit into this picture?also, maybe my question is worded poorly but I am unsure if I would interpret this as he behaves that way because HE likes me romantically and this oppresses him in some way or that he believes I want a relationship with him and I oppress him?? this possible interpretation annoyed me very much as I do find him attractive but do not flirt with or bother him in any way, I've kept it all inside!Anyways, as usual, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! :bows:"
1272,"Hi guys!I got to answer this now if I am going to book this ticket...There is a workshop called ""Path of Love"" in Costa Rica that I have been considering doing, it's kind of a therapeutic get together, with a sort of spiritual but cultish tinge to it, run by devotees of Osho and kind of a bubble.. Anyway I want to do it, but I asked the I Ching how it would be..first I got 61 unchanging, I thought I needed more information.How will this workshop effect me on my spiritual path?10.1,3,6-->28hmm tiger tails.. sounds a little dangerous?Finally I just asked... Should I do it??58.2,5-->51Well maybe I should just go to costa rica and hangout on the beach or something instead. It seems like this group may not be so good for me?

1273,"like ""what is the potential future for us"" type questions. each time it has come up it's been the 2nd hexagram.does that mean there's a chance we might ""return"" to being together?would you interpret it as being the future or the sea that the first hex swims in?(im kinda heartbroken so i ask a question about it every few days)"
1274,"I was driving back from a client meeting this afternoon when I passed a car going the opposite direction.  After I passed that vehicle, the driver tapped on the brakes and I saw him look back.  It was easy to see him do that, since his windows were down on the car.  As it all happened in a split second, I'm not entirely certain, but I think it was Terry.  It looked like him and his vehicle.  Hmm, makes me wonder....So, I casted this evening and asked ""Was that Terry?"" and got 39.4 to 31.  Not exactly auspicious, but I'd have to believe the 39 is in the past and we're entering into the wooing phase?  If so, I'd take that to mean a yes.I followed up with a fun (although a question that doesn't always get a straight answer) one, ""What did he think when he saw me?"" and got 24.4 changing into 51.  I think the IC is saying it was a shock to him.  If that's indeed the right interpretation, it certainly makes me giggle.  "

1280,"How do you guys deal with finding the right translation?  I have Karcher/Ritsema, which give a pretty good main hex description, but the moving lines are impossible to decipher.  However, their main hex description, while clear, often contradicts other translations.  And then I go to this site where you can enter the original and future hexagram and it will show you the judgment, image, changing lines, and future judgment/image, and you can select from Daniels, Legge, Wilhelm, or Crowley translations and go back and forth.  You can also view nuclear hexs if you're into that (I'm not).The site is here: http://psychicscience.org/ching5.aspx(note, I'm not promoting it, it's not my site.  I'm just sharing it cuz I find it useful to quickly enter your starting/ending hexagrams and see 4 translations with the click of a mouse).But sometimes they seem to contradict each other and I get confused.Like with hex 38, Daniels (and also Karcher/Ritsema in my book) say ""keep things separate"" or ""things that should not be connected"", which sounds overall negative.  But Legge, Wilhelm, and Crowley say ""success in small matters"" which sounds marginally good.Confusing!!!"

1283,"I see a lot of relationship questions posted here (which I've done myself, too!) and often the resulting hex will be something that sounds good, but experienced posters will say that no, it actually doesn't mean the relationship is going to go well.Like the hex will say something about a man and woman, so the poster thinks ""cool, that must be symbolic of us!"" but it's actually like a king and a peasant or something, or the hex will say something about ""great success crossing the river"" and they're like ""cool, my relationship will work out!"" but it actually means ""great success crossing the river to go back home, alone"" or something like that.Obviously I just made those up, but you guys know what I mean.Also, are there any hexes that you start worrying when you see developing, like ""obstruction"" or whatever that one is?Just wondering "
1284,"Hi Everyone,I hope you're enjoying the spring. The blooming is so beautiful!Some of you may be aware of my situation, but here's a quick recap: *My current job doesn't pay me enough, they don't pay me on time, I love it, it's what I want to do as a day job, but the fact of the matter is, I need to move on, 'cause I can't be poor anymore and I need to grow up and add to my coffers.*I'm looking for other jobs within the same industry. Have gone on interviews in the past, but, although I'm qualified, I never got the job.*I'm writing a lot of fiction. Got published a few years ago in a tiny magazine, but I'm much more passionate and proactive about it now, actively revising and submitting my work to lit mags. Writing fiction is what I REALLY want to do, deep down on the soul level, and what I've always wanted to do since I could retain a thought.I asked the I Ching if I should tender my resignation at the job I'm currently working on within the next two weeks and start looking for temp work. I got 33 unchanging. Should I retreat from the thought of going the temp route or should I retreat from the job I'm working at right now? I took it as don't make a move right now and make a strategic retreat, so lay back and formulate the plan, but don't act on the plan yet.I asked the I Ching what the likelihood of getting another job in my industry was? Like, the jobs I'm applying for and interviewing for? I got 29.3 to 48. Seriously, every time I ask the I Ching questions regarding working in my industry, doing what I currently do, I get ""Danger"". Oh great! That just indicates to me nothing but failure.So then I asked, what is the likelihood that my fiction writing career will jump off/begin this year due to the fact that my work will be published? I got 25.4 to 42. WHOA. I'm totally approaching this with innocence, as this is a lifelong dream, and only super lucky people get to do what they deep down want to do in their lives, so getting published is NOT concrete, it would be a dream come true, and I'm not expecting to get published at all. I'd LIKE to, but it's not in stone in my mind. And then the relating hexagram is ""Benefit/Increase""? GOSH, what could that mean? Another uncanny thing is that the I Ching has been REALLY supportive of ALL of my writing related questions this year. Lots of 1s, 22s, 63s, 51s, 55s, 58s, I mean, all complex, but really positive stuff. The changing line, is like ""listen to your instincts"" and 25 is all about listening to the mandates of heaven, following your fate, letting destiny unfurl, wait for the surprises.My final question, which was spurred by some weird inner need to ask it, was: ""So what do I do until then?"" ""Then"" being reaching my ultimate dream of actually being able to be a writer for a living, that I WISH would happen, but that I'm not BANKING on, 'cause it's a total dream. And I got: 62.1.2.6 to 14. Hexa 62 is all about handling details, keeping your head to the ground, being practical and then 14 is ""Sovereignty/Possession in Great Measure"". OH MY GOODNESS, how should I possibly read this? I mean, those changing lines, at least according to my super negative I Ching book, say:62.1 ""If you are considering an extraordinary plan, forget it.""62.2 ""Use whatever common affiliations you have with others to bring you into a secure position.""62.6 ""Your ambitions may be too great. In an aggressive attempt to reach an unrealistic goal you will meet with disaster.""But then it changes into ""Sovereignty/Possession in Great Measure""?! Those lines suggest this whole writing dream is a delusion, so is the relating hexagram my delusion, my ultimate dream, and do I need to dispel this thought or is the relating hexagram the outcome of small efforts?AAHHHH!!!So, as always, this was way too much information. Thank you for reading and please forgive me for rambling. I would really appreciate your thoughts. Much love x"

1287,"Still learning and wondering...Is a hex text a fixed prediction regarding a question or a guidance through a maze of future? As, for example, if you get a line which says something like ""... those who neglect their duty will lose friends...""

1292,"Greetings all,I posted a few weeks back about a recent breakup with a woman I still love very much. See this thread for the background:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=9940She has recently been more receptive to me, as some time has passed (3 months) and we've run into each other out and about on two occasions. The other day she sent me a text asking to meet for coffee next week.I'm not certain what her intentions are with this meeting. My desires are to share with her some insights and realizations I've had about our relationship that I think would do much to help clear up things for her. Communication has been an issue for us, and the breakup was abrupt and ambiguous -- no opportunity to discuss why or how things could be resolved. I've since had many understandings on reflection and wish to express these things, but I am concerned about compromising any progress that can be made here by saying the wrong things, or having the wrong attitude in this moment.She hasn't given any indication she's changing her mind or wanting to reunite. Our mutual friends have advised me to move on, that it's over. Not sure if this is just tough love advice, or if its based on things she's said to them. But I feel strongly that we have something worth giving another try, and that some open communication could help clear up the ambiguities that must've played a part in her decision. I don't have any hope of resolving things immediately -- I feel that she does need an extended period of time to be alone and find her center. But I just want the door to remain open for us, as I think there's incredible potential for another chance down the road. I've done much consulting of the I Ching (too much at times) on this situation. Here are some recent readings that I could use help deciphering. Some are a little redundant, asked at different times, and in some cases I have written out my own interpretations...What about X and I getting back together?3.1 > 8I’m told in the beginning of this process that I should “establish foundations rooted in the past” and enlist people to help me. My purpose is “moving correctly.”As a relating figure, 8 Grouping is about heartfelt and spiritual bonds, as well as relationships dissolving and reforming.Together, these figures seem to imply that somehow the basis of our previous relationship could lead to a reforming and reunion… I’m not clear on how to ‘establish foundations’ in the past, as much of the Yi’s advice and common sense says to let go of the past… perhaps there’s another way to understand that line.How can I open the way for this reunion with X?21 unchangingThis figure describes breaking through obstacles with tenacity. It says there has been enough contemplation, that the time has come to act. I’m really at a loss here. It seems counter-intuitive that I should do anything drastic in this delicate situation.What should my attitude be when meeting X to help reunite us?57.6 > 48I have to get from this that I should avoid going into the spiel I’ve been rehearsing about my insecurities in the relationship causing my reserved behavior. This seems to be the hidden thing referred to, that I wish to express to her. Perhaps the Yi is telling me that this could negatively affect “the Well” that could connect us and nourish our future relations…What about talking with X about our relationship?58.2.4.6 > 42It seems that opening this communication can lead to a flourishing time for us. As long as I follow my inner direction and be careful of her sensitivity around the topic, avoiding negative emotions, this will be a good thing for us. By expressing my ideas here I will be drawing out the discussion hopefully for future growth.Any help with these would be greatly appreciated!Blessings,STLast edited: Apr 26, 2010"
1293,"hello,following on from my question about my partner's plans to move to my city...I asked what will happen with our relationship when he does? 11:1,3,6 to 4.Intuitively it seemed to suggest that thing would move forward positively but 11:6 suggests some pretty serious ups and downs...also having read Topal's thread on 11:6 (http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=10071) it seems like it may even indicate a complete reversal or disintegration! Other ways of interpreting 11:6 seem to indicate that 'walls will come down between us' or that it means the relationship will become more real and honest and about what we or I really want...hmmm...as always 4 felt like a reminder not to ask so many questions and to accept that things are never simple, but I always get confused by 4...I'm pretty confused generally in fact and slightly panicked by the thought of wanting something for so long which is likely to fall apart just when it seems to be getting better!! So in the light of recent discussions, I'd love to hear what others think is a good way to interpret these lines!Thanks,ELast edited: Apr 27, 2010"

1295,"Dear I Ching community,What exactly does the first line of 55 mean? I enquired about a girl I like, we have known each other for some time now and I believe we have lots in common. Although she keeps saying that she doesn’t like me more than a friend, I can sense that we are on the same wave length and that there is a hidden connection between us.  My assumption is that she keeps her distance due to a possible mistrust towards me as she has a relatively low self esteem and doesn’t see herself attractive. She may think that I am interested in her because of her money or citizenship. On top of that she is concerned about her parents who won’t approve a relationship with someone from a different ethnic background.  My question was: “Is this girl my soul mate”?I ended up with Hex 55.1.2 changing to 32. As for the first line the confusing thing comes in the Wilhelm’s commentaries. “They can be together ten days and it is not a mistake- more than ten days is harmful” I don’t understand this bit. Could it suggest that we are not suited for a long term relationship?  L.2: I sense that it describes the situation and hindrance between us but promises an improvement as the power of the truth (destiny perhaps) will have its influence on the whole situation.Hex 32 seems to be about a long term relationship, possibly a marriage.Also, a long-long time ago I asked the I Ching “Who is my soulmate”? I ended up with Hex 13.5 being about 2 people who have some connection between each other but they can’t unite until later due to many obstacles keeping them apart.Moreover, I have also come up with the same reading when I asked the I Ching: “Why did this girl come to my life”?Thank you in advance for your insights and interpretations "

1300,"Hi all,Usually I scan the archives for readings, but I found little here on 14.3.5. I'm trying to figure out if I should continue contact with a past flame who has recently reestablished communication. This person has hurt me in the past, hence I'm cautious about moving forward. Things felt great between us when I saw him 10 days ago, but I'm not sure where to take it from this point. He asked to see me again; I said I'm too busy now, maybe later... 10 makes sense, obviously there is a danger to this. It's the moving lines that confuse me. Does the 14.3 relate to me; should I offer something up? Or is he the petty man who (still) doesn't have much to offer? And 14.5 talks about benevolence while maintaining dignity? I've always had trouble interpreting these two lines. Any insight will be appreciated! :bows:"

1303,"In my Karcher/Ritsema book, 27 is ""jaws/swallowing"" and the summary is open your mouth and swallow.  What?38 is ""polarizing"" and says ""things that are connected but shouldn't join.""Ok.For 27, I also see these explanation:Daniels - ""Provide nourishment. Allow yourself to be nourished.""Legge - ""Indicates that with firm correctness there will be good fortune (in what is denoted by it). We must look at what we are seeking to nourish, and by the exercise of our thoughts seek for the proper aliment.""Wilhelm - ""The Judgment: The corners of the mouth. Perseverance brings good fortune. Focus on how one may provide nourishment to fill one's own mouth.""So does 27 refer to oneself being nourished?  Maybe that's what ""open your jaws and swallow"" means.So now let's look at 38:Karcher/Ritsema - ""things that are connected but shouldn't join.""Daniels - ""Polarise opposites. Keep things separate and estranged.""Those two are pretty much the sameLegge - ""Indicates that, (notwithstanding the condition of things which it denotes), in small matters there will (still) be good success.""That one sounds more positiveWilhelm - ""The Judgment:  Opposition. In small things, good fortune.""That one sounds positive, too.What is ""in small things?""What has been your experience with 27 and 38?

1306,"Good morning!A little quiz to brighten the start of the weekend... Last Sunday (April 18) I had to catch a plane. I live in Western Europe, so, needless to say, my flight was cancelled due to the Icelandic volcano's ash and rescheduled to Tuesday 20th. On Monday I decided to ask the Yi: ""Will I manage to travel to my destination tomorrow?""The Yi replied with 18.6 (Work on what has been spoiled), changing to 46 (Pushing upward).Anyone cares to interpret this reply, and guess what actually happened?

1307,"Good evening everyone!First off I must compliment the regulars of this forum. The discussions you start and the contributions you make - which I've recently become an eager reader of - are absolutely fascinating in their different tones and angles. I'm really impressed with the quality of the interventions, and the willingness to share knowledge and provide support. I'm hoping some of you will want to shed some light on three readings I made today, after being inspired by other discussions and by Hilary's suggestions on how to pose questions (thanks!). The purpose is to get a better understanding of a situation I started the following thread about a couple of weeks ago:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=9944In brief, some time ago I started a relationship with an online friend who had shown what appeared to be serious interest in me. Immediately after this start, I had to leave for a long business trip. He turned cold instantly, which led me to end the relationship. I heard from him only once since. I still haven't been able to understand what caused his sudden change of mind.I asked:1) How did things get the way they are?59.6 > 292) What is the real issue here? The core of the matter?6.1,3 > 13) What does this person want from me (if anything)?12.1,5 > 21I had a look at the hexagrams / lines meanings on various sources, and also searched for similar combinations in other discussions, but I must admit I'm totally lost! Any clarification will be highly appreciated. :bows:Thanks,Cris"

I am looking for some guidance in regards to current situations in my life. Now for a little back round info. I just moved to a new state CA, quit my previous job that I loved, to work and support my family's business and connect with a girl who I have liked for some years now. My family business is new and there is a lot of energy behind getting it off the ground and running smoothly. I have been at the fore front of this push. I also have begun a romantic relationship (2 months) with this girl who i moved down to connect with. We have been friends for 3 years, and we have deep affection for one another. Before we began dating, she had her mind set on moving back to her home state AZ, in the summer time. I truly have deep feelings for her,and would like her to stay, but of course will support her in the decisions she makes, even if that entails her leaving. (which I have told her). I have been consulting the I Ching. I receieved hexagrams telling me to take it slow. which is great advice, and I am trying my best although I feel that the limited time is flying way too fast. I have had this energy of urgency in two big categories in my life. Work: getting it off the groundLady: building a healthy foundation to grow upon.anyhow, I just consulted the I Ching with my question being simply the title of my job and my girlfriend's name. I was thinking about how to balance the two, and be successful at accomplishing my duty for work and keeping this relationship alive and vibrant. I received hex 19 no changing lines. One thing to note is that if she did move back to AZ, she told me she would look to want move there this next coming winter. 8 months from now. with hex 19 talking about the 8th month, i thought that interesting. she did postpone her trip to stay over the summer.NEW QUESTIONSokay so, My girlfriend looks to be moving in to my house for the summertime, so we could spend time together. I have been helping as best I can by looking for jobs online for her, and finding activities in the area to fuel her passions.  She does not know if she is moving back to AZ, but she recently said that if she did move back it would be in the fall, and for most likely a year.I asked the IC 3 questions and it of course gave me 3 answers. Here they are.thank you for helping me. 1. when living together, what do I need to be doing? (by this I meant to make the time we spend great and full of peace)answer: hexagram 172. what does M need from me in order to make this relationship blossom and flourish?answer hexagram 543. Is this true love? and if so what steps do I have to take to make it sustainable and flourish?answer 20.3>53please excuse me for the long thread. thank you to everyone who helps me interpret these.walk softly.matt"

Due to the current strong relationship and the circumstances of moving to be closer to him, I have been asked this question by many, but always brushed it off without any real thought ....""Umm...no..it's not about that...we are *only* best friends now..this is about the children.""..is pretty much what I say AND think automatically to this question.And yet today, it somehow seemed different and I began to ponder this.....

1321,"Hi Everyone!How ARE you all?! I hope all is well! Mercury Retrograde is in full effect, but the forced chillaxation is so beautiful! Been nice to look at the sky without hearing the noise of the planes overhead OK, so random: I submitted my work to this writing competition months ago. On the submission form, it said that the winners would be notified at the beginning of April, latest. Haven't heard anything AT ALL. I've been checking out their website and their Facebook page from time to time, but no word, even though they're hosting events in the next four weeks to honor the celebratory-contest-related-issue. A person posted a comment on the Facebook page, asking whether or not the winners of the contest would be revealed now, or whether it was an Oscar moment at the event. They completely ignored that question and digressed on another topic. Also, another person asked on Twitter whether or not they've chosen the winners yet. The response to the Twitter question was ""Come to the event and all will be revealed!""I'm not OVERLY tripping on what the outcome will be, but honestly, I'm definitely interested in knowing what the results are, come what may. I asked the I Ching ""Am I one of the three finalists/winners of this competition?"" I got 14.4 > 26. That, shockingly, is a very positive response, at least from my perspective.Then I asked ""Has the magazine contacted the competition winners yet?"" I got 63.4.5>55. To me, this indicates that they in fact HAVE notified the winners already. So, if that's the case, why did I get such a positive response in the form of 14.4>26 (which I interpreted as a big fat ""yes"") to my initial question? If I may be a winner and they have contacted winners already, then why haven't I heard word? Of course, in reality, I'm probably not a winner, but the I Ching never steered me wrong, so I'm wondering what's going on.If I won or lose, whatever, at least I tried. I feel great for even submitting my work and having the opportunity for other people to read it. That's a serious blessing. Still though, I asked super direct questions and I got super direct answers that seem to negate each other. Am I blindly interpreting this? Kinda confused.Thanks for reading this! I would really appreciate your help. Have an amazing day! xx"

1325,"I keep getting Hex 2 for work and career situations. Does this suggest something like ""be constant, keep doing what you're doing"" or a, I getting this all wrong? And then, depending on how the question's asked, I keep getting 43 too. I don't understand what it is I need to accept as the truth. Do I need to be more assertive or not?And as for a couple of you who responded to my post few weeks ago - I did get a job offer and if I take it, I'd be moving to Paris in about 2 months. It's not permanent but it could be and it is with a really great company. You were all right in some way and, Willofox, you were on the spot!2 - it was a question regarding a very long, unchanging situation of doing jobs which seem pointless and feel humiliating, not leading anywhere. So it is not about just getting something, but really making a step up.43 - in regards to getting a sense of direction, so not a job per se, but just being on the right track in my career for once, not feeling so scattered any more. The main feeling is that of seeking stability and clarity, really, and 43 just keeps coming up!Last edited: Apr 22, 2010"

I am still in love with him but feel disappointed both at him for having taken advantage of the situation and at myself for having put up with it. He's not a bad person, in fact he has very publicly supported my work, and helped me in other ways (I'm a hard worker and have earned it, what I mean is he has always been extra supportive as far as work was concerned; but where our relationship was concerned he took advantage of my dependence on him to play ""on-again-off-again"" mind games).I have more or less reached the end of my tether and have backed way off, without saying anything, which has surprised him. He hadn't seen it coming because I always seemed so docile and accepting of his comings and goings. I had never complained.

1329,"Hi, I'm a new poster but I've been reading this site for the last few days to try and get some ideas.My relationship recently ended due to non-typical circumstances.  I've been trying to gain a better understanding of what happened, and from reading this site I learned that I'm not supposed to ask yes/no questions.  So I aimed my questions at learning what is going on and how to proceed.What can I do to best help our relationship now?52.3 > 23What can I do to restore our union?64.4.5 > 59What is blocking (other person) and me?57.4 > 44What will happen if I contact them tomorrow (Wednesday)?42 unchangingHere is my interpretation of my answers, but I'm new to this so I'd love input from anyone, especially the regulars 52.3 > 23 - I asked ""what can I do now?""  It says ""don't do anything now.""  23 also says ""keeping still"" and ""splitting apart.""  Is this saying that I definitely shouldn't do anything now?  Or is it saying if I don't do anything now, then the result will be ""splitting apart""?64.4.5 > 59 - I asked ""what can i do to restore our union?""  64.4 and 64.5 both say ""preserverence bring good fortune.""  But one of them talks about a victory being won.  59 is ""dissolution.""  Is this actually a warning that ""doing nothing"" (perservering) will lead to dissolution?57.4 > 44 - I asked ""what is blocking us?""  I have no idea what 57.4 means here.  The future hexagram is 44, ""coming to meet"" which I thought sounded good, until I read this line: ""One should not marry such a maiden."" 42 - I asked ""what will happen if I contact her tomorrow?"" (Wednesday, if that matters).  42  says ""It furthers one To undertake something.""  That sounds like a ""definitely do it"" answer, although that also would be a more fitting answer to a Y/N question, which I didn't ask.Help?"
1330,"I had initially planned to stay in this foreign country for 5 months, but when I bought the tickets I had not yet met the man w/whom I began a relationship  several months before leaving.

Twice. Unchanging - the marrying maiden. Implies it is a bad idea, no? That i wont have any power or say in events if i do this?Then, since this was a general/overall reading, I asked how returning early would specifically affect things between me and this man. The Yi said:   40.1 and 54.40 suggests ""going back to your roots and reconnecting with home and allies. When you know where you’re coming from, it becomes a lot easier to be clear about where you’re going."" Line 1 says no mistake.

He found two to apply for, both leadership positions in arts/culture for not-for-profit organisations. Both, on paper would be amazing opportunities, for which he is well qualified. So, I asked:What will happen with Job A - 42:1,5 to 23What will happen with Job B - 55:1,3 to 1642 sounds incredibly positive to me and interesting that it specifically refers to movement 'crossing the great sea', the lines also seem to be referring to sincerity and good intentions and being able to help people which also fit with the type of job he is going for. 23 can sound very negative, but feels quite transformational in this context, especially as this move would be an enormous change for him, in terms of location, environment, and taking our relationship to a different level, and leaving behind a lot of difficult stuff that's been happening over the last few years, very much a sense of 'peeling away' layers.With Job B I get a sense of an immediate positive response to his application but nothing long lasting or concrete.I'd love to hear any other opinions!E"

1334,"Hey Since all of you helped me a lot with the last reading I had trouble with, I'm asking you to do your magic again. Sometimes it's just hard to see all of the aspects of an Yijing advice.Here I go - first, the situation, in short:I'm having a fling or whatever with a man considerably older than me, which is not the issue. The issue is that he is married (don't judge me, please, since it's the very first time this has happened to me and I'm reconsidering my moral guidelines concerning relationships, as I've always tried to work as God and the people command and have been used a lot as a result). I don't want to destroy anything, I just want to experience - and considering the things I heard about him, I'm not his wife's only problem. Also, an even greater issue is that we became good friends as a result, and I realized he is a man of principles and truly a good person, a good friend to many. It's just that he is having ""problems"" with his libido Another dimension of the said issue is that we both mingle and work in quite a large circle of people who know us both by name and by deed - and like us both very much.Some of them know what's going on - some don't.So.What I asked was this:What will happen with my relationship with the community if I pursue my relationship with him?And the answer was:50. Ding. The Cauldron.Changing lines:1: (which I interpreted sort of like - it seems an untenable situation but you can handle it easily; proceed)2: (which I interpreted thus: you're fine, the problem is on his back, not on yours)...and the scary 4, which says to me my reputation will be diminished if I don't handle this properly.Changing to Hex 22; Bi, Pot of Herbs, which I perceive as quite a positive message (everything is fine in the end as what is within you is good or something like that) but am not sure what to make of it as such.So.Any insight? Everything seems quite simple and obvious, but I want to see what your minds make out of this combination and the possibilities.Thank you!"
1335,"By the strangest twist of fate, was invited to an event on my own and entirely by chance ended up at this gathering with the man I've been casting about on here over the past few months.  Spent several of the most relaxed and interesting hours we've ever had and came home even more confused about moving away, or not, which i've considered after serious issues at my place of work last week.  Have no idea how this evening sat with him but, to me, it was quite special.I asked the IChing tonight, ""What should I know about Xs feeling for me now?""  I hope that's a legitimate enquiry and not too confusing question.  The casting was:  Hexagram 35, changing lines 1 and 6.  This becomes Hexgram 51.  Sounds extremely wild to me.  Hexagram 35, Progress, the first line means to me that you have, or will, come up against resistance time and time again.  This might be the description of how things have gone thus far in this relationship?  We seemed in the beginning to keep going back to square one like each meeting was the first.  Sounds possible?  Line six to me is the end of something halting that has gone into a full blown campaign, attacking with ""horns""?  Like a bull on a rampage?  Could be good OR bad?And this is changing to 51, which I used to think was dire, dangerous; but have come to look at as possibly exciting change, something that goes through a radical ""earthshaking"" process.  So if I try to put this together, would I be safe in saying that tonight's gathering was experienced by him as a big change as well?  Are we making progress here, as the first hexagram would indicate [at least on the face of it?].  Please contribute your two cents if you will.  I'd love to have some indication from the IChing which way to head and, of course, I'd most like to think this relationship is going somewhere and the job issue isn't going to end up dictating my direction.In case that's not the best question to ask, I also did this enquiry:  ""What is the potential of this relationship?"" and I got Hexagram 49, moving lines 3 and 5; becoming Hexagram 51.  WOW more shock. Sounds like the latest volcano.  I think line 3 is about his attitudes and feelings needing to adjust, and maybe he's turned that corner.  The fifth line seems to me like a confirmation that there is something here, at last, to believe in?  And here's Hexgram 51 again.  LOTS of shocks going on.  But in this reading, a bit of a mystery again.  Wonder what the shock's about exactly?  Help.  Help.Last edited: Apr 18, 2010"
1336,"Thought I'd do a fun casting tonight to get a glimpse into the way I am.  My parents split up when I was rather young (I was 8 years old) and never really got to know my Dad.  I've always been a tomboy and enjoy activities that are stereotypically ""guy"" things, i.e., cars, power tools, building/remodeling stuff.  I recently got a garage and have been spending time organizing and tinkering around in it while listening to talk radio and have found it to be so enjoyable.  I haven't had a garage before in my adult life and have the feeling I've been missing out!So, I asked the IC ""Does my love for garages and tools come from my Dad?"" and got a 9.5>26.  I take that to be a yes, as the changing line says ""If you are sincere and loyally attached..."" I would interpret the loyally attached to be the interest being somewhat of a family trait, a/k/a ""from Dad"".  What do you think?I'm sure the IC is happy to get a break from my ""What about Terry"" questions these days!  LOL!  (Still moving slow as molasses there...) "
1337,"Hi, I have asked the i-ching: what does the universe have to tell me in this moment?

From what I understand, this is seems to be telling me to focus on inner truth and the oneness of the world around me. I recently posted about my recent break-up with my long-term partner and I am interested if there may be any correlation, in other words, to continue to seek inner truths?

I will not break even in the end, even if the book(s) are published, although I did not set out to do this for the money.

1346,"Just in case you haven't become totally sick of hearing about relationship issues, here's another one.  I've received a lot of help this past week on a reading about crazy times at work and determined maybe it's time to look around for other employment prospects.  Right where I am, there are no other prospects unless I create them, which isn't impossible, but I'd need to know a good reason to stay in this part of the world to make that kind of effort.  ON THE OTHER HAND, there is a cherished relationship with a man here, someone who's been grieving, as you may recall me writing on a few occasions before, and we've been friends all the while and it's unclear to me if there can ever be anything more.  If I leave the country, that's the ballgame for this relationship, I'm quite sure.  Anyway, before I blast off into the stratosphere rather than build a new job in this area, 'd like to know what's possible with this man, if I can.  I cast for: ""what do I need to know about Xs level of interest in me?"" and gotHexagram 55, changing lines one, three, four and 5, becoming Hexagram 8.  LOTS of changing lines.  I've looked at Wilhelm and LiSe's Yijing so far.  I read about Wu and his attack on the city of Shang, his breaking an arm, and etc.  WOW am I lost.  I know 55 is called Abundance and indicates rapid progres, but bears warnings about abundance not lasting.Hex 55 Line one says if you find an ally then stick with him and don't change course.  That sounds significant in this instance.  I'm all for that.  In line three the seeker is supposed to find/acquire/create inspiration.  If that's me, I've already got it, if it's him, that's the question mark we're casting about.  Line four seems to advise facing your fear head-on.  I don't know if that means he will or can face his fears of  new disappointments finally. And line five says it's Auspicious and recommends honouring those who deserve it so that all can see.  Hmmmm.  That could be anybody.  At that point, the hexagram transforms into Hexagram 8, for which I don't know any negative meaning, unless you happen to be Fang Feng.  Has we reached the Fang Feng stage and it's just too late?  -- I don't know.  Or is this really about a prospective Unity with a person who's been a friend now for a long while, and the point at which the situation solidifies?There was some speculation last time I read for this fella that April/May might be a significant turning point, but no indication of that so far.

A man jeopardizes his own life, and his family perishes thereby. However, this is not all necessary; it is only the result of transgressing the law of natural development. If one does not willfully provoke a conflict, but confines himself to vigorously maintaining his own position and to warding off unjustified attacks, all goes well.I am not sure what this means ultimately but I believe it is x that has rashly entered the struggle not me. I do not believe I have willfully provoked the conflict but have maintained my position20- Seems like he is considering it but hasn't told me yetWill I win lawsuit 18 unchangingThe noble one stirs the people and nourishes virtue (deng ming-dao translation)I just let x know my position and I think that is stirring him to behave virtously and drop the lawsuitWhat will x do about lawsuit 6.3-44Nine in the second place means:One cannot engage in conflict;One returns home, gives way.The people of his town,Three hundred households, Remain free of guilt.In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace. Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If, out of a false sense of honor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict, he would be drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and conciliatory attitude benefits the whole community, which will then not be drawn into the conflict.It looks like he will retreat Will x call me tomorrow (before court( 50.2.4.6-15)line 2 If a man concentrates on such real undertakings, he may indeed experience envy and disfavor, but that is not dangerous. The more he limits himself to his actual achievements, the less harm the envious inflict on him.I think that looks good for me, x is not happy about this but that is not going to harm menot sure about line 4line 6Thus the work finds favor in the eyes of the Deity, who dispenses great good fortune, and becomes pleasing to men, wherefore all goes well. Seems favorable to meWhat should I do about tomorrow 56.1.3.5-25Not sure about this but line 5 looks favorableIf he knows how to meet the situation and how to introduce himself in the right way, he may find a circle of friends and a sphere of activity even in a strange country.25 By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage.I think this refers to me, I am not trying to take advantage of the situation Sorry this is so long.What does anyone think?, I appreciate any comments about my interpretation."
1354,"Hi!Last year I lost my job as head of department. My boss offered me a new position within the company. Few days later my father died and a week later my child was in the hospital with severe infection. It was to much to handle at once + the recession, so I took this new position. During the winter I was sick quite often - my imune system was not in best shape.Now I have some energy again and I asked I ching - Is it good for me to start looking for a new job?The answer was 21 - 3,4 --> 22Can you give me a little help with this ?Thank youand have a nice dayKaya"
1355,"Hello good people, Last week I revised a contract with a vendor so it would be a non exclusive deal between us, meaning I can sell my ""wares"" to other vendors as long as it doesn't compete with this vendor and myself. Originally, this vendor had sent me an ""exclusive"" contract, but we had talked it over in detail and I told him my reservation was that I be able to continue selling my item to other vendors who are non-competative to him. He agreed he was fine with that and told me to just ""add it to the contract.""He was very amped to get the thing done and now, after I sent the revised contract, it's been a week since I've heard a peep from him.I send 2 follow up emails earlier this week: one a resend of the first and then one to confirm status and ask if the non exclusive clause was an issue for him, as written.No reponse...I asked today: ""what is my next action with mr. X and the contract?""and got60 unchangedI've read about 60 unchanged and understand it means setting standards and limits on things (like with a contract?) and that all involved have to be agreeable (which is why I wrote him a note asking if the wording was amenable and to advise). Our last conversation was that I would make these adjustments, he'd then look them over and comment and we'd go from there--a traditional negotiation. My intent is to sign a contract that works for both of us; I don't wish overstrenuous limits to be set for either party and I'm quite happy to deal with him to get there.So I'm wondering, what is the Yi advising I do next to get this contract in motion? Thank you,:bows:"
1356,"Hi allI have been seeing a wonderful man for the past 8 months - someone I could really see myself with, and who felt the same way (mentioned children often, said stuff like ""we have our whole lives to visit [insert place name here]"", took me to visit his family in the first six weeks of dating, and then twice more in as many months, talked of moving in together, called me the ""light of his life"", asked where I had been all his life, etc).However he broke up with me last Tuesday and I am still reeling.  He is 10 years younger than me but that was not an issue in and of itself.Everything I have been reading on the subject of reconciliation with an ex recommends no contact for a period of at least a month.  However I was wanting to text him tomorrow as it is a very sad anniversary for him of something in his professional life that happened a few years ago (and he told me he marks the occasion every year), just to say I hope he wasn't too sad.  When he broke up with me he said he felt ""not listened to"" ""glossed over"" (something no boyfriend has ever said to me before) and also ""overawed"" (ditto) and so I am torn between observing the no contact rule and wanting to demonstrate, by remembering this significant anniversary, that I did of course listen to him all the time.  Any time he seemed upset, I would ask was he ok, and he always answered ""I'm always ok"".  Ditto when I asked ""Are you upset with me?""  He would always say ""Sweetie pie, am I EVER upset with you?!""  So I just naturally assumed that things were ok.  His feeling ""not listened to"" was complete and utter news to me and the first I heard of it was when he was breaking up with me.I asked should I text him tomorrow and I got:  hex 55 changing to 52.I then asked should I wait at least a month before contacting him and I got:  18I then asked should I wait for him to contact me instead, and got:  49 changing to 37Finally I asked what would the outcome be of me waiting to hear from him rather than initiating contact, and I got:  23 changing to 4.What blows me away about 4 is the mention of ""the young fool"", which could not be more apt given our age differences.  Also the mention of my not seeking out the young fool but rather the other way around.  Of course, I don't think he is a fool, but I do think throwing such a fantastic relationship away without giving it (or me) a chance to change and work on whatever he felt was wrong is a bit hasty and foolish, given all of the wonderful stuff that was there and the beautiful 8 months we just spent together.  I suppose because I am older I know from experience how bloody hard it can be to find a true soulmate and someone you can really see yourself settling down with, and maybe he doesn't yet realise this.Anyway, any insights anyone has on any of the above would be most welcome.  Many thanksspecialKLast edited: Mar 29, 2010"
1357,"I had a very dear friend/co-worker.  We had a falling out last summer.  She betrayed me.  It wasn't what she did that caused me to end the friendship, which I valued so highly, but it was the huge sense of betrayal I felt.  I have been dealing with trust issues for some time now and trying to be very careful who I allow close to me and careful as to how many ""2nd chances"" I give after being hurt by someone I care for.The thing she did in itself wasn't important to me at all, but the knowledge that she was able and willing to betray me at all hurt deeply and I wasn't prepared to keep the friendship and allow myself to be vulnerable to that kind of hurt or betrayal again.I miss her very much and am still hurt over her betrayal, but I'm moving far away in June and doing deep reflections on people and relationships right now.  I valued her and her friendship very much prior to this incident and I would like to send her an email telling her so and telling her I forgive her and miss our friendship.Asked the IC for insight into sending her this email and received hex 34.1 -->32.The hexagrams seems fairly positive regarding this question...?  But line 1 sounds like maybe it's just not a good idea or not time yet...?(Added afterward)  I also asked IC how my friend would feel about the email if I send it and received hex 15.3 -->2.  Would really appreciate any thoughts on this as wellNamaste' "
1358,"Hi, This is my first post, and am seeking an advice/interpretation of this hexagram. I asked the question: what does the future hold for X and I? The background to situation is as follows: X is my ex-boyfriend. We broke up about three months ago and continued to live together until about a month ago. We were together for over four years, and had the friendship turned love kind of romance that we both expected would last forever. Our break-up was unique: we had just moved out of state for my grad program and I broke up because of these stresses and feelings I felt guilty having for someone else. We had mentioned working on things but have decided to go our separate ways at this point. I would like to continue to work on my self/school at the moment, but want to work on things at some point.  At this point, I am feeling very confused because I love and know that I want to be with him in the future, but what exactly is i-ching telling me about this (and him, at all)? Any help would be greatly appreciated!Many, many thanks in advance.Last edited: Apr 15, 2010"

1360,"How Does 23.4 become Progress...Hex 35?I've read some archival threads on this one, but can't find anything that really equates with the situation I am in.  This is about work and an incident which occcured recently. On two occasions, I brought a problem of liability to the attention of my supervisor who basically ignored me.  We are actually friends, but whatever was going on with her a few weeks ago, she just didn't want to hear what I was saying and gave an opinion that was 180 degrees from Company policy AND from where she was last time we discussed any of this.  She was fairly hot when I mentioned this problem a second time and the clear message was to ""can it.""  As the liability involved in the problem is enormous I simply addressed the question to authorities over her head, knowing if the thing blew up, the Company would have real trouble and I'd be blamed for not being more persistent.  The problem then was taken care of, quickly, by my supervisor, when higher authority insisted she would listen.  She did a good job solving the issue, but also sent an email telling me to never go beyond her authority again as it caused lots of trouble for her.  I explained to her why I had done it and that she had left the company, and me, exposed by refusing to listen both times I brought the issue up.  She seemed to accept what I said and we let it go at that.Fast forward a week.  I am called in for a meeting alone with my supervisor an hour before the office opens, to discuss new policies and procedures.  We are a few minutes into the discussion when she says that she has received a letter from a professional association criticising my customer relations techniques and implying that they are questioning their ties to our Company as a result.  I asked her to read the letter and she refused to let me see it.  She also refused to say WHY I couldn't see it, but just flatly turned me down.  I think this really unethical, but she says the only point she wanted to make is that I will be required to completely change my attitude and behavior on the job.I've thought about this overnight and today called her to again request the letter and she became quite furious.  We've scheduled a meeting on Monday as she refused to talk over the telephone about it.  There are several possibiltiies I can think of here.  I feel there truly is a letter that says something detrimental about our company.  I notice in the few days since she said the letter arrived, she has made some big changes in how she herself is presenting some of our product and behaving in customer relations.  In regard to me and my performance, however, I realise she may be reacting out of anger because I went over her head a week before, and now is telling me I have caused all this problem, exaggerating basically. Then again, it could be that I'm not really named in the letter at all, but she's using its mysterious existence to make a point of her authority.  Or another possibility:   these situation aren't related and she, as not only a supervisor but a personal friend, doesn't want me to see the letter because it truly is hurtful.  Or there could be other explanations.Anyway, I am baffled and upset that I still don't REALLY know what I'm supposed to have said or done that caused the criticism because I can't see this letter.  At the moment, a follow up meeting is scheduled for Monday, at my request.  I've asked the IChing -- ""Why won't X let me see the letter?""  The casting was 23.4 changing to 35.  As said, I can't find a previous situation that seems to equate with mine in the Clarity archives and I am stumped what this reading has to do with the issue.  Thoughts anyone?  All help is much appreciated.Last edited: Apr 10, 2010"
1361,"Some things which I interpreted would resolve themselves in a certain  way based on my interpretation of  I Ching readings did not come out  as I had expected. The situations are not over, but I had expected (also based on the readings) them to resolve themselves by a certain time, which is now past.  Anyway, that has led me to be less trusting of the I Ching as a divining tool and oracle.This is the second time this ""crisis of faith"" afflicted me. But this time i decided to turn to the I Ching for an answer.Question: What should i do about this crisis of faith?I got 13:1 (Fellowship with Men)>33 (retreat).Since I got Fellowship with Men, I thought that at least an aspect of an answer might come from posting here.Any help would be greatly appreciated."
1362,"Hi guys,something funny happened last night. For the last couple of weeks I had this strange thought: it's at least three-four years that I don't get the Abysmal in my readings. Well, here we go!!  I came back from my hols, asked a question, and I practically called the Abysmal my way!So, what's the situation? I went through a very painful breakup. I am doing really well and I used this to dramatically change many aspects of my life to the better so it's been the starting point of many positives. The big issue is that I am left with a lot of distrust and disillusion on the whole idea of being in a relationship again. I have asked myself many times if I could ever trust somebody's words again. On the other side, I have lately found myself wishing to... fighting with myself not to become cynical by giving up on people from the beginning. So, a lot of confusion, of strong contrasting feelings: on one side, the desire to believe in life; on the other, the impression that it would be unwise and I'd set myself up for further disappointment. I'm afraid of losing myself.Last night, I asked if I could have some clarification on what I was going through and how to get some peace and trust life, eventually, again.I got 29.2.3.6>53 (Sorry wrote 59 in the title by mistake!!).Could you pls help? I am still trying to interpret it and I didn't find past readings to look at... I am clearly very confused... Looks like it's shouting to me to just do nothing at all...Thanks in advance!!turandot"
1363,"This very well may be an incredibly silly question to approach the IC with, but the surrounding circumstances made me too curious to resist!  Will try to keep the explanation brief (I realize I tend to be very wordy!)Have been doing some major people ""housecleaning"" recently, with a particular emphasis of one man from my past.  I've deleted ALL contact info in order to prevent myself from any temptations to connect or communicate with this man.  He lives nearby and I even choose a different (sometimes longer!) way out-n-about, rather than even drive by his house. Such is my desire/hope to disconnect and sever this relationship.Today, I not only took this ""long way"" to the grocery store, but I additionally went at a time when I know is during his working hours... (not necessarily intentionally, but it's odd that I DID happen to note the time as I got into my car to leave and felt a sense of satisfaction that he would most likely be safely at his work during this tiime.As I parked my car in the lot, I see a car similar to his pulling in, but I didn't give it much attention because there was such a slight (to none!)possibility that it would be him.  Enter grocery store....grocery shop as usual....half hour into it(it's a VERY big store!), I run directly into HIM!!!!This seemed so positively inconceivable on so many levels that I was nearly floored by the shock!  So after so many ""precautions"" I had taken, I asked IC, ""why the chance  encounter?""Response:  hex 31.3.5 to 16.Reading on line 3, I see mentions of unhealthy addictions/attractions, which certainly describes accurately this association.  However, I can't seem to ut line 5 into the perspective of my question nor the resulting hex 16...Hope to get some thoughts on this confounding and way TOO coincidental and unlikely meeting of the very person I was trying so hard to avoid!!  It's interesting to note also, that I don't live in a particularly small town, there are many grocery store options here (even right in our neighborhood), and in all the many years I've known this man, I've not once run ino him grocery shopping before.  Extra funny, to not that there have been many, MANY occasions in the past when I secretly *hoped* to accidentally run into him...and NEVER did!!...Almost seems as though this was God's idea of a sense of humor.....almost!!!Thank you!

I just moved to a new state CA, quit my previous job that I loved, to work and support my family's business and connect with a girl who I have liked for some years now. My family business is new and there is a lot of energy behind getting it off the ground and running smoothly. I have been at the fore front of this push. I also have begun a romantic relationship (2 months) with this girl who i moved down to connect with. We have been friends for 3 years, and we have deep affection for one another. Before we began dating, she had her mind set on moving back to her home state AZ, in the summer time. I truly have deep feelings for her,and would like her to stay, but of course will support her in the decisions she makes, even if that entails her leaving. (which I have told her). I have been consulting the I Ching. I receieved hexagrams telling me to take it slow. which is great advice, and I am trying my best although I feel that the limited time is flying way too fast. I have had this energy of urgency in two big categories in my life. Work: getting it off the groundLady: building a healthy foundation to grow upon.anyhow, I just consulted the I Ching with my question being simply the title of my job and my girlfriend's name. I was thinking about how to balance the two, and be successful at accomplishing my duty for work and keeping this relationship alive and vibrant. I received hex 19 no changing lines. One thing to note is that if she did move back to AZ, she told me she would look to want move there this next coming winter. 8 months from now. with hex 19 talking about the 8th month, i thought that interesting.  she did postpone her trip to stay over the summer.any help interpreting the whole hexagram and its teaching for me would be greatly appreciated.walk softly"

1371,"Hi all,I’m new here, but have recently begun cultivating a relationship with that most sagacious spiritual oracle, the Yijing (Alfred Huang translation). Found this site a couple days ago, and am grateful to have access to the wealth of learning and support available here.My question is this: when one is faced with a “conflicted” reading between the hexagrams and the changing line, which takes precedence? Specifically, I recently cast 11 (Tai, Advance) in response to a question I posed about taking on additional duties at work. The changing line was 6, which altered to 26 (Da Xu, Great Accumulation).Unless I’m making some kind of beginner’s mistake, I read the decisions for both 11 and 26 as favourable. Yet that changing line has left me in a quandary. It forecasts humiliation, that the “castle wall returns into the moat.” Does this mean only that the transition between states will be fraught with peril, or does the danger of the changing line somehow cancel out the positive readings of the hexagrams?I guess what I’m looking for in this case is some sort of guiding principle for addressing such a reading. Any help would be much appreciated!Thanks in advance.--J"

Last night, as I was putting my daughter to bed, she mentioned to me that her father had hit her while she was visiting with him over the weekend. She is only 3 years old and I checked her for any marks and could not find any.Unsure what to make of it (and not wanting to rip her father's head off for what could have been a simple swat on the hand) I asked Yi if her father had in fact hit her.My answer was hexagram 44 unchanging.Does this mean that she was being a typical toddler and he disciplined her?Not sure what to make of that.Things are not so happy for she and I where we are living and I have been thinking about moving out of state.

I asked what I need to do to get a teaching job for next year, with the idea of am I doing enough, is there something else I should be doing.

I'm really keen to understand this and I'm obviously supposed to, or I wouldn't have received it twice.  I'd be really grateful for any insight or experience with these lines.I'm not having a brilliant time at the moment and on Saturday in a somewhat despairing moment and with everything (failed relationship, job I don't really like, feelings of having screwed up etc etc) whirling around my head, I asked 'What's the answer to all of this?' (17.1.2.>47)  I read the Wilhelm and Anthony translations, but at the time didn't have access to any others. I felt that I was being shown a choice of life path in 17 but what to follow? 47 was clear, - I am exhausted from recent events and I know that I have to pull myself together and 'stake my life on following my will' although I'm so confused I don't even recognise the true nature of my will at the moment.The following day, I asked again, - 'Please show me an image of my correct life path' and again 17.1.2 >47. The problem I have is that now having read Karcher, and also Lises wonderful translation, I'm confused with the two lines. 1. Leave your old life behind, following this influence will transform you2. You have picked the wrong impulse to follow, you will end up alone Karcher seems to imply negativity in line two, but both seem to me to bear equal weight, especially in Lises version. I suppose my confusion lies in sensing them as distinct options yet not knowing which lines advice to take or to what they refer.  Are they both about my personal development, in which case how do they relate to my external circumstances which at the moment seem sometimes unbearable to me and most definitely in need of change, - an attitude change or an actual physical change?  I have a certain degree of freedom in my circumstances and am no longer tied to anything really, other than a job which I don't really need to do, and a close, rather ambiguous 'friendship' with my ex.  I've always hoped that I could continue my art and writing, and I wonder if this is the path I should focus on to the exclusion of all others.I don't want to ask more questions of the I Ching until I have made a concerted effort to understand these lines and I'd be very grateful for some help.Thank youLast edited: Apr 12, 2010"
1377,"HiI've been struggling the past few days with my patience regarding something that I've wanted for quite some time (don't wanna get too much into detail) so I asked the Yi ""Why must I wait to get what I want?"" and got 50.4.6 > 46, now I see this as being somehow unprepared to get it, but line 6 talks about jade and something great, but I just don't see how that fits with the reading in general.Can anyone give me some pointers regarding this reading?Thanx!P.S.: Sorry to spam my own thread but I got the urge to ask the Yi ""When will I get what I want?"" (not think about an specific time but in maybe the conditions that need to be met) and got 35.2.3.6 > 32, I believe this reading talks about the path that I must follow (evidently since the relating hex is 32. Duration) however I'd like to know opinions regarding this, since I don't really want to interpret it (fear of getting either too positive or too negative).Last edited: Apr 11, 2010"
1378,"Hi all, I asked about my relationship in question, a general overview, and I got hexagram 16 with changing lines 2 and 3 and turning into hexagram 32.What do you guys think? I wanna think it's a positive one but I'm not sure if I'm being objective. Can someone help me?Thanks!:bag:"
1379,"I'm back with part three of my enquiry to do with a relationship central to my life since last year, that has progressed thus far to a friendship and I've been wondering if it ever goes any further.  He's been grieving the loss of his spouse for a bit less than two years and that seems to occupy a lot of his attention, although we've enjoyed each other's company and, in moments that he is more relaxed, we seem to draw closer together. But mixed messages are rife, like our last get together when he was brave enough to invite me for dinner, but had a neighbor join us for dessert.  On here, we all decided at the time he is just that gentlemanly and was afraid of overstepping the boundaries of our friendship.Willow Fox, last time I posted, had projected I could expect progress this month or next.  So far, the man in question has been away on a journey and just returned a few days ago, but we haven't yet spoken at all. I'm anxious to know whether he will be contacting me.  I've determined at this point to just leave it to him what happens next.Since I will be working quite near his home this weekend, and when I am over that way, he sometmes comes by, I asked, ""Will he be coming to see me this weekend?""  I cast Hexagram 45, unchanging.  So I read various opinions on what this means and it seemed more a spiritual connection than a physical meeting?  At any rate, not quite sure of the meaning, I asked ""Will he be contacting me soon?""  And in that instance I cast Hexagram 58 unchanging.What I know of Hexgram 58 would indicate joy and celebration -- maybe an actual DATE?  In any event, the fact that these are both judgment castings seems like the IChing is trying to get out a hammer and whap me on the head with the import of its wisdom.  If only I were smart enough to get the message!   Do I read correcctly here that he's definitely going to be in touch and this will be a joyous meeting?  I've fooled myself on more than a few occasions and would like objective opinion, please."
1380,"Hi all, I asked Yi what a particular person wants from me and received hex 20.5 changing to 23.I have a general idea of what hexagram 20 means but am a bit baffled by the meaning of line 5.Nine in the fifth place means:Contemplation of my life,The superior man is without blame.Does this mean that this person wants me to see how we are alike? Or does it mean that they want me to see how we as a whole are interconnected.The resulting hexagram to me represents a discarding of unnecessary elements to make way for something new, like in tarot The Tower card.A transformation that may initially stir up uneasiness and confusion but ends up being advantageous to the person undergoing the transformation.We are both politically minded individuals so I am wondering if it is the second interpretation rather than the former.Thank you."
1381,"I have been having a difficult time personally and professionally, so I asked the Oracle ""What does life hold for me now?"". I got Hex44, no changing lines. I read it as an indication that things will soon get worse, much worse. Am I right?As a follow-up, I asked ""How do I regain my self confidence"" and got 33.2 -> 44. That 44 again! And 33.2 seems to suggest that I should not really attempt anything now, merely yield to the situation and withdraw. I feel got into trouble in the first place by withdrawing into myself when confronted with trouble, and that my challenge in life right now to stand up for myself, make a change in my life and show leadership. Yet the Oracle seems to say the exact opposite. I am confused!ThanksLast edited: Apr 9, 2010"
1382,"Hello everyone, I hope you're all very well.Before I ask for some help, I thought I'd tell you a little about how I got here.I have always been interested in consciousness, dreams, and so on, but only very recently started to pay this side of my life any serious consideration (I have a very academic background, and have always struggled to shake off what became a quite annoying scepticism.) I have been reading lots of Jung, McKenna, and so on, and after paying attention to my dreams, their qualitative content really increased, which I found very surprising.My readings around this area led me to the I Ching. Now, I am interested in making a change in my life, away from a career that really doesn't interest me - I wondered if the I Ching could help me clarify what options are open to me, or what avenues I might find most rewarding.When it came to formulating particular questions, I asked a quite general one -(i) ""What do I need to know about myself? "" - I received the hexagram, 'Pushing Upward' (no. 48 in Wilhelm's translation.)The following day, I asked a similar question (prompted by the suggestion on this website) -(ii) ""What do I need to know now?"" - I received the hexagram, 'Grace' (no. 22 in Wilhelm's translation), with first and last lines changing.Could I ask advice on two points, please? In your experience, how specific a question might the I Ching answer? And what is the 'best' way to get 'inside' the hexagrams? How do you, as more experienced users, begin to interpret your readings?Sorry for the rather long (first) post, and for what might be rather naive questions.Thanks."

1384,"Hello all,I was wondering if anyone could please help me interpret hex 28 in regards to a question of whether I will get a specific job that I recently interviewed for. I have been looking for months now and have had many many rejections and agreed to volunteer in my area of expertise, just to do something. I had worked extremely hard as a student, prior to the recession, and sacrificed very much in the process. I think I might lose my mind soon. I understand that this hex indicates excessive burden, being over one's head but what does 28 mean in my situation? Am I on the right path? Will this be over soon? Thank you so much!"
1385,"Hi!I usually listen to my intuition when playing with Yi, but in this caseI need some smart  advice desperately.I asked all kinds of questions and kept getting this combination, for examplenot too long ago I asked 'What is my course of action regarding problem Y"".The last one was ""How beneficial is it for me to do X"" and got this reading yet again.I have to admit I'm lost here and I was hoping someone could help me out here, as hex 2 lines contain way too many allegories and metaphoreseven for my intuition.

1387,"Hi all, A couple of weeks ago, I posted a thread on a reading I had done about an acquaintance I had recently started to get to know better at a platonic level.I had asked Yi to show me the circumstances regarding this new friendship and received hex 24.2.3.4.5.6>1 as my answer.I was a bit confused about how to read this and decided to just see what happened with this new friendship.Well, this friend and I are actually spending a great deal of time talking and it's somehow having an affect on me and how I see the world. Hard to explain but I see his presence is helping me to overcome some bad habits I have accrued over the years.Maybe he is a positive role model for me?I was wondering if maybe that's what Yi was trying to tell me with this reading. Or am I way off base? The turning point of hexagram 24 and then the relating hexagram 1 seem to point to making changes and having the push to do so."

As this 2nd bully is a lot bigger and 2 years older than my son, my son did not do anything about it at the time as it was just in town one day.Now my son fears he will be bashed up by him and his mates and I have not idea how to help him, so I askedwhat action can be taken to stop the bullying and rec'd38.2.6>2.This is a very distressing situation to both of us so I would appreciate your interpretation as soon as possible.BlessingsMelissa"
1389,"Hi there,I've posted before about my relationship, which has some pretty difficult complications but is still good and developing. Because of circumstances (distance, illness, family commitments) we manage to spend very little time together right now, although the will is there on both sides for this to change over time.I'm really aware that my partner is trying his best to make time for me in very difficult circumstances but I often feel like I can't speak to him about how stressful it feels for me sometimes. I don't want to waste the time we have and also feel that you can only deal with so many challenges at once. If I'm honest I'm also frightened of making things more difficult than they are and that he might decide its too overwhelming (something that has happened before). Unfortunately this leaves me feeling quite isolated and also feeling that I don't have the full picture of what is going on, as he tries to be cheerful and not talk about difficult stuff too sometimes. I asked ""what if I talk to him about how I'm feeling, and what he's really dealing with?""I received 55:1,2,3 to 40.With three moving lines which seem either contradictory or developing from auspicious to more and more difficult I'm unsure of how to interpret this. It seems to be saying that honesty and sincerity is the best way to go but not to make a big deal out of the conversation, to maybe discuss as it comes up naturally. I also get the impression that he might find the conversation difficult but that this doesn't indicate its a bad idea. If I see 40 as the context to my question, this seems to imply that things will be made better, that tension and difficulty will be relieved by talking things through, that the hardship cannot last for ever. I'm not at all sure that I have this right though, its an intuitive response to what I'm reading...I'd really appreciate any thoughts you have on this...I've looked at Blofeld, Huang, and Lise so far but a wider interpretation would be great!Thanks in advance,Ep.s. I also asked a few days ago, ""what do I need to know about the relationship right now"" and got 23 unchanging. I didn't interpret this as 'we are splitting up' as in fact we are getting closer right now, but we are divided by distance and circumstance, and lots of old stuff is 'splitting or peeling off' right now for him in terms of massive changes in different parts of his life. What I took from it is there is nothing I can do to impact this process right now. Anyway, might help as a bit more context... "
1390,"Dear friendsI'd love to get your feedback on this.I asked Yi ching 2 questions, and I'm not sure it or rather I cam handle the questions or the answers.here it is:Should I prepare to spend my life alone?

1391,"I find this Tiger Woods commercial totally bizzarro. Three days after Easter and shows him being forgiven by his heavenly father. What the...?I asked, ""What is the message of the Tiger Woods commercial?""I received 5.2.3-3:5.2 ""Waiting on the sand. THERE IS SOME GOSSIP. In the end brings good fortune."" 5.3  ""Waiting in the mud brings about the arrival of the enemy""3. Difficulty at the Beginning.These lines suggest to me that a lot will depend on if he has much Difficulty with his game and how quickly he gets his swing back. 5.2 sounds like if he plays well even though there has been gossip in the end there will be good fortune. On the other hand 5.3 sounds like if he doesn't get back on his game real quick he'll be over taken by his competitors and no amount of positive publicity can save him then.I realize now I was hoping the I Ching would talk about how shameful it is Nike/Tiger are using his dead father like this but it seems IC doesn't give that a thought and cuts to the chase - it all depends on how well Tiger plays.-RosadaLast edited: Apr 8, 2010"

1393,"I asked, what is the root cause of this [emotional & physical block with my most intimate friend] problem? And received 35.5. It is such a positive hexagram/line that I am not sure how to interpret it within the scope of a fairly depressing personal situation.Memorably, and less personally, 35.5 came up a couple years ago when questioning the ambiguously positive outcome of a grant application. We got some but not all the funding requested, with no response to the proposal itself & no indication of whether more funding would come. Since then we have gotten more money from the same source, in the same fashion, at least twice. The sporadic nature of that donor relationship is maddening to me (hard to make a budget when you don't know when the money is coming, or what triggers it) but I am grateful for the support, of course.So how does this 35.5 principle apply as a diagnostic? Perhaps it is merely descriptive. Certainly the relationship is erratic in its emotional substance & also in its physical aspect, which very recently resulted in a mutual humiliation from which we are not yet recovered. Been thinking a lot about the triggers there & feeling pretty bad about myself, and I think he has also.Anyway, taking a slightly different tack I asked: what if anything I can do to help eliminate this block between us, and received 63.1.2.6 to 57. ""Penetration"" is always an ironic answer to questions involving sex!"
1394,"Hello all,I'm enjoying teaching but it is hard to tell how well (or not) I am doing. The children are good at chorally repeating what I say, individually they of course find it difficult to speak due to pronunciation, and I gave a written test to my older group this week and despite having spent the past two weeks teaching the same words they're still not quite getting it, aside from a few clever ones. I've been playing games with the older ones too which has proved complex especially in a big class and with prizes involved (sweets). Ah well, it's trial and error. To make it fair I've had to let each student play this particular game individually leaving the rest of the class to watch (talk) which wasn't what I intended! Just want to move past it! Plus I wasn't organised enough and didn't properly record who has and hasn't played meaning some could easily play again and I wouldn't notice (as there are sweets involved) but I think the rest of the class would put a stop to that! Should be over by the end of this week though I hope!Anyway, I asked for advice re. my younger students (grade 2 - 2nd year learning English)Hex 44I've been teaching them animal words and prepositions (not sentences just single words) but I think more often than not I have been introducing too many words in one go and not going over them enough. But I don't want them to get bored...Does hex 44 suggest I'm coming on too strong? I asked this before my lesson this morning which was quite successful but when we played Chinese whispers it wasn't the success I thought... I was whispering two words but each time they only came out with one (if that...)Advice re. my older (grade 3) students:Hex 59This could be to do with washing away the game that I'm trying to get through and making a fresh start (it's getting boring and I feel bad for those who did not get a sweet/have to spend the lesson watching but I have to see it through (rod for my own back situation). Does this hex suggest I need to move on from whatever I'm focusing on now? That would be nice...Finally, there's a guy here who I feel I get on with well, and have been wondering if there could be more as I am also physically attracted (darn). He's quite a catch but also sometimes a bit stubborn and maybe a bit of contention between us sometimes, but he's very kind and always positive! (opposite from me although I feel I'm getting there recently - was recommended a book called 'The Secret' by another girl here which sounds like I could benefit from - theory/practice though eh...)Anyway don't know if it's anything special as he doesn't particularly seek out but we seem to gravitate when together. Plus we're in a big group (where I finally feel accepted/able to be myself! Has been so long since I've felt that way! and if I do feel a change I feel I will be less sensitive as in the past because I feel I understand how things work a bit more. Namely think and behave as if you're liked and you will be! As someone else said to me before. Seems to be working!Maybe I'm starting to like myself too a bit more recently! And I feel less needy although still have love on the brain :/ But also more interested in concentrating on teaching and where I'm going next in my life, independently. Travel/change of environment seems to be a good cure for depression - because of course there's more going on outside you! But I know also demons don't die that easily - always keep vigilant as the I ching would say! (Maybe a hex 63 ref?)Anyway I asked what is the intended nature of the dynamic between me and this person?45.4,5 > 2To me this reflects that we are in a large group. He is probably the most influential in the sense that he is quite a quirky character, and knows the most Chinese! So maybe hex 2 is reflecting that we're receptive to each other but keep it open and gather naturally and openly? Does it suggest romantic attraction? Or perhaps just friendship. I think there was an attraction but it wasn't acted on when it could have been and it kind of feels like it's bypassed that and staying in friendship mode.. but I feel slightly frustrated by it. Plus I find it very hard to tell, and tend to get carried away with myself. Maybe when it is mutual there is less guess work needed... I don't remember though it's so long since I had a relationship!!Advice on any of the above would be great. Sorry for the waffling though!:bows:"
1395,"Greetings all,First off, I'm new to this board and a neophyte to the I Ching. This looks like a beautiful, supportive community -- I'm glad to have found it! I took a teleseminar on Divination last fall and was very intrigued by a talk by Stephen Karcher, which led to my buying one of his books as well as Wilhelm/Baynes.I hadn't had much pressing need to consult the oracle until the beginning of February, when my girlfriend abruptly broke things off with me. We'd been dating for a year and a half, but we'd previously crossed paths several times over the past 10 years, since high school. Our shared passions and interests are uncanny, and we're both Geminis. I definitely feel for the first time in my life that I've found my soulmate in her. The challenge from the beginning, however, has been a big one. She was separated and in the process of a divorce when we ran into each other and began dating. The divorce was her own decision -- there were too many irreconcilable differences for her. She was unsure if she was ready for another serious relationship, but we both felt it was worth trying. From the start, our relationship was imbalanced in my treading carefully with her emotions and giving her space to heal. There were several occasions throughout our time together where she would grow emotionally distant, and I would suffer silently. Eventually the tension would come to a head and she would reluctantly admit that her grief from the failed marriage was clouding her feelings. After these  intense outpourings, we would continue on. My hope was that this would grow easier with time, and I avoided raising the issue or pressuring her to talk through the emotions.Last fall I suggested we move out of our hometown together, for a fresh start somewhere else. She put her house on the market, and it sold very quickly. It felt like it was meant to be. We made plans to move at the end of the coming summer. Things seemed better -- there was no emotional distance, and we both seemed on a solid path together. But then at the beginning of February, she abruptly ended things. She told me she wants to be alone -- that she doesn't ""feel the same way"" I do, and that for the longest time she'd been attributing it to her divorce. So, it seems she has shifted from thinking that her pain/grief from the divorce was the reason for not falling fully in love with me -- to the feeling that there's just something missing between us. Looking at all this, I'm sure it could seem that it just isn't meant to work out. But without turning this post into a novel (sorry!), I will just say that there is amazing potential for us, and I feel that perhaps the timing was not in our favor. I feel that given another chance, we could more openly discuss and work through the emotions involved and grow intimate at the level we weren't able to before.It has been 2 months, and there has been some email communication, fairly one-sided from me pouring my heart out. I have gone through many shades of grief, and it continues still.Thank you for reading this lengthy explanation -- it still doesn't do justice to all the factors involved, but I felt it is important to understand my predicament in regards to the readings I've done.A few weeks back, I asked the Yi ""What about she and I getting back together?""I got 19 changing to 24 as a response. This seemed to be very favorable, indicating that if I used care and sympathy, and patience, that it would work out in the end.I recently asked the same question again. This came after an email exchange that was somewhat harshly worded on my part. I felt I might've fallen off the path that the Yi advised, and wanted to know -- once and for all -- if I should give this any more hope or energy, or just give up and move on. I also was hoping for insight on how I should proceed, if there is a chance.This time, I got: 32 changing to 40. This seemed to suggest that I should continue working to mend the relationship, that a reconciliation is possible. I was a little confused by the 32.3 line, which implies improper actions on my part and ""disgrace"" as a result. Overall, I feel that the Yi is telling me to not give up hope, to persevere. I was prepared for a response that conclusively told me it is not going to happen, so I could begin the process of healing from this. I realize I have little knowledge of how to properly interpret these readings, and don't want to draw the wrong conclusions in this important question.Again my apologies for the length of this entreaty, but any help or insight here would be hugely appreciated.Cheers,ST"
1396,"And they're off...British Labour Prime Minister, Gordon Brown yesterday declared (at last) a general election. I asked the I Ching last Thursday, ""Will the Labour Party win the General Election?"" and received 29.4 > 47. Superficially not looking good for for Gordon's party - The Abysmal moving to Exhaustion/oppression - but still ambiguous...? Does this point to an outright defeat (as I'm inclined to think) or possibly a hung parliament? Or just to the fact that it's going to be a difficult struggle either way?(I'm not voting for either of the three main parties, so I have no stake in them winning or losing)"
1397,"Hello all :bows:This forum has very much helped me in many situations and I appreciate everyone's assistance with interpretations. Just the act of trying to figure out readings has helped me too.I've been studying several interpretation for 42.6 as it relates to a mutually supportive relationship in which we've 'had each other's backs' that at the moment feels restricted/less open. We've seen each other several times in the last month and each time my friend has been supportive--but reserved. I was thinking time would turn things around but that's not been the case. The loyalty and caring we've built is very dear to me, a rich blessing.I asked ""what do I most need to know about this now?"" and got 42.6>3This line reading makes me wonder if I may have been careless with giving From the reading I get that accumulating increase but not sharing it stops the flow of good things; and that being consistent in heart, over time, are things I need to look at. I understand hex 3 to be about growing something new, which I am not sure how to apply here. Growth in our relating? Difficulties to overcome with nurturing and care?So, putting this together:Perhaps to grow together in a new way I am to be attentive to giving back the many blessings I receive and that consistency in my heart (caring, generosity of spirit) is needed in order to open up and keep the flow of good things going. That all this would be a good thing to do right now.Other insights?"

1400,"Some of you remember my desire for deeper connection with someone at work I could barely speak to whose last day of work was last Friday. I designed a special card and had a number of people sign it. My final gesture was to put my business card in the envelope with a message on the back of the card that said ""This card entitles D.... .... a motorcycle ride to any location in (name of city). Offer valid between April and October (motorcyle weather).Pending Weather!I really sweated as to whether to send it so asked Yi:Is it Advisable to add my business card to D's card? and received Hex 50.3.6>40. I have read this to be auspicious, in spite of the ominous 3rd line which states the cauldron with the places of its ears changed. The progress of its subject is thus stopped. The fat flesh of the pheasant which is in the cauldron will not be eaten, but the genial rain will come, and the grounds for repentance will disappear. There will be good fortune in the end.. The 6th line overrides this to some extent as it speaks of rings of jade. The resulting Hex 40 is Deliverance. I have concluded that I did the right thing by putting my card in the envelope, even though I haven't heard from him. One of his employees and friend said he would call me and things would work out right, which, of course, was my intention of putting the card in the envelope. I would love to hear from you your interpretation of the reading."

I asked in February - as I admit I do each month since he left:""Is there anything I can do inner and outer throughout the month of February in order to promote a favorable reencounter with M ?""16.4 > 2 Meanwhile I was getting very close to my dance teacher at the time, very slowly, and it felt good (but...trust!), so I asked:""This approximation feels somewhat strange and full of hidden agendas - where is this friendship heading to?"" again, 16.4 > 2 Sure enough shortly after that I discovered he has a girlfriend and he was somehow hiding her from me (there goes building trust...). I stepped away from his classes for a while but at some point felt I was loosing way too much because he is a tremendous teacher and just came back.But my unconscious got the best out of me and I had some sort of panic attack after his lesson, lost motor control, lost sight, the whole ordeal. I was so ashamed of myself that I decided not to go back to his classes, nor see him again. I put an end to ""it"" (whatever ""it"" was)Nevertheless I asked:""Please give me an image of what just happened at B's class and its consequences?""38.6  > 54 And then I had no teacher to work with, so I went into another school to meet a teacher that was always inviting me to work with him, and we hit it off quite well, and there is some chemistry even, and he seems to like me. But again he is the typical latin-gigolo-womenizer caricature, and I am growing fond of him slowly, but struggling with trust. Last night I asked, ""Before this guy turns into yet another Boogie-Man may I just ask if there are benefits in a romantic involvement with him?""And again... 38.6  > 54 Sorry for the lengthy explanation. It just overwhelms me that these were almost all man/love/relationship questions i asked in the last 2 months and  I got the same answers.... They are different scenarios but they all refer to man-woman dynamics with a lot of hidden agendas and mistrust, but also magnetism and desire. I want to let someone new in, but I can't seem to be able to overcome the unexplainable ending of the missing guy... What are your views on this? I could also share my own interpretations, but it's already so lenghty (sorry) and  i admit they are very manipulated by my contraction around the idea of a reencounter with Guy1 (the missing one). So I want to read 16.4 as ""partners join suddenly. No doubt"" - but then it makes no sense that there was lying and rupture with professorB. I'm also very curious about this mutation into 54, (both teachers) which for me means romantic involvement in situations I am not their emotional center. In professorB makes sense, he has a girlfriend, but with professorC... I don't know. Maybe he is hiding a girlfriend also! God, clearly confused... appreciate your insights... :bows:Yoana Last edited: Apr 5, 2010"

1406,"Having asked the question, What is the potential to sell my house soon? -- I got the baffling answer, Hexagram 44 unchanging.  I can't imagine what that means, so can anyone else interpret this please?I'm getting a bit anxious because there are so many reasons that I need to free up the capital just now, including finding a home for myself.  I'm in another country and renting, which is to my mind throwing money away.The property I'm selling is attractive, placed on the market at a really good price about eight months ago.  As in many parts of the after-the-recession world, there are many properties for sale just now, but it's coming into the season when this area normally has a lot of buyers.  How can 44 relate to this situation?"
1407,"Hey thereHope all is well here. I have been away for a bit cos of work and new man (I wondered about the connection between sexual abstinence and 27 a few weeks back and it was about him)...Now, after a couple of months of fun times and a few days of strife and stress, he called me yesterday to say he cannot continue seeing me cos he had a bad break up last year which he believed happened cos he didnt listen to his intuition and this time he wants to listen to his intuition instead and that's telling that we're not right for each other - I think he is listening to FEAR but I didnt press him on that...I am quite relaxed about it now cos this guy is the impersonation of hexagram 51 THUNDER AND LIGHTNING so it'll be good to get a bit of peace for now  but I did cry over it yesterday cos I felt our connection was beyond amazing. We're both intense people as we found out these past two weeks hehe...anyway, one thing that got him worked up was when I confronted him about what he was doing on Wed night. He told me he'd be working (he is a performer of sorts) but I quickly found out that he was not performing at the venue where he told me he'd be by making a quick call to the manager cos I got suspicious (daft to even expect to get away with that but he tried...and failed). In fact, during our telephone conversation yesterday, I left the ""best"" till last (to ask him how his show ""went"" on Wed), he refused to answer the question and then hung up on me. So, first he told me he wanted to break up and then he suddenly hung up on me leaving there like a lemon. Weird. This morning, I found out he deleted me from his friends on Facebook LOL! I mean...it is a bit extreme bordering on childish but whatever...Anyway, so I asked a few questions to our Oracle friend and I got some answers...would you be so kind as to check and see whther I am interpreting them correctly? I feel more confident than last year but still a bit wobbly Anyway, here they are:Does X have another woman?54.2.4>24Line 2‘With one eye, can see.A hermit’s constancy bears fruit.’Line 4‘Marrying maiden overruns the set time.Delays and marries at the right time.’Is that a blatant yes or what...someone that he keeps ""on the side""? Or is Line 2 about me and how my time with him went beyond what was supposed to  I have my theory on this, that he didnt foresee he'd feel so good with me and then decided to make a cut...men...you gotta love them Why did he go as far as to delete me from his Facebook friends?40.2.3>62Line 2‘In the field, taking three foxes.Gaining a golden arrow.Constancy, good fortune.’Line 3‘Shouldering a burden while also riding in a carriageInvites the arrival of bandits.Constancy, shame.’This got me stumped a bit...he is untying knots and releasing me from his friends list to make sure I dont know what he is up to? He does not trust me...not sure if I get this right..Will X change his mind about me?20.4.5>35Line 4‘Seeing the realm shining out.Fruitful and useful to be a guest of the king.’Line 5‘Seeing my own life.The noble one is without mistake.’Does this mean that after reflecting on it, there will be progress and so he will change his mind on the break up?Can X and I reconcile?41.2.6>24Line 2‘Constancy bears fruit,Setting out to bring order: pitfall.Not decreasing, increasing it.’Line 6‘Not decreasing, increasing it – not a mistake.Constancy, good fortune.Fruitful to have a direction to go.Gaining servants, not a home.’This seems positive but not sure about the servants...are they fans / followers...he is of a certain status, is known in a certain area of entertainment...anyway, confused about this answer...How can I improve things with X now?50.1>14Line 1‘The vessel with upturned feet.Fruitful to get the blockage out.Taking a concubine for her child,Not a mistake.’I need to clear up the negative stuff but is that what happened between me and him or help him clear up his fear of last year's break up happening again? I guess he should get over last year's bad experience first...so maybe the first interpretation would be more correct? What would be the outcome if I sent X an email to clear things?24.1>2Line 1‘Not far away, returning – no regrets here.From the source, good fortune.’Seems like he'll be receptive to that...? Right thing to do in order to improve things with him...Will X be back to me?45.4>8Line 4‘Great good fortune, no mistake.’Self-explanatory, maybe? A gathering that turns into a union...though it does not give me a specific time...but maybe when Mercury turns Direct again How can I have to deal with this now?59 unchangingI guess I have to let things go right now...let him stew a little and then send him an email...Is X’s decision not to see me final or will he change his mind?28 unchangingDoes this mean the situation is beyond repair or that he merely overreacted yesterday?Will X find balance again about me?17.1.2>47Line 1‘An official has a change of heart.Constancy, good fortune.Going out of the gates, joining with others, there is achievement.’Line 2‘Bound to the small child,Letting the mature man go.’Does this mean that he is feeling oppressed right now and that he has behaved childishly but he will change his mind once he starts milling about with people, friends, exchanging opinions and ideas...? How does X feel about me now?7.2>2Line 2‘Positioned in the centre of the army.Good fortune, no mistake.The king issues a mandate three times.’He is being forcefully using his power to show me that I should not mess with him. A strategy to put me in my place...changing to 2 might mean that he is still receptive to me though?Sorry about the long-winded message but I wonder whether I am grasping the meaning of the Oracle's messages better these days...Hope you are all well...Bea "
1408,"I have had another confrontation with my neighbor.  My house has been on the market for only 2 1/2 months.  I have had a lot inquires about renting my house.  There is a large demand for rental places in the area.  We are fairly rural.  But none about purchasing it.My question to I Ching:Should I rent my house out and move somewhere else?40.2.5 to 45I took this to mean a yes?  But not completely sure.I also asked ""Should I put up a fence between the neighbors and I?""14.3.6 to 54I took this as a yes too.My ex husband bought a new house and offered to let me rent our old one from him.

1409,"Just an addition to my question posted about How to stay cancer free: 10 years ago I was told I had three or less months to live, that I had a tumor in my lung pleura area...that the radiologist said was definitely bad news...so much so that they  thought it would be a waste of time to do a  biopsy.  I caste an I Ching which stated I would be OK but would have a chronic complaint and live on.  (I wish I had written the number of the hexagram down, but I think it can easily be found).  After much anguish this turned out to be true, and the tumor turned out to be what they call a ""loculation"" WHICH means a fluid filled area after tons of surgery for breast cancer(mastectomy and reconstruction etc)   3 years ago I was told I had a tumor in my heart...this news coming about after I innocently went  for a stress test as part of an ordinary health work up.  This was indeed horrible news, giving me almost options...but my I Ching again said, no...I would live and be joyful soon.  (Did not write the hexagram number down).  All during the ultrasound on my heart and the following procedure during which they stuck a small optical device down my throat to view my heart...I nourished optimism.  It was unbelievable they thought...a hardened area due to a blood clot from my chemotherapy port 10 years ago.  I would live...no problem and just get it checked from time to time. Never would I have known until then that the I Ching could also be so literally true.  Peace, Love, CNMN!"
1410,"Hi, I asked the i ching how my business would go and got hexagram 5 with 5 changing lines to 23. I am new to the business (I'm a psychologist) and have a lot of clients at the moment but am finding it exhausting. I am applying for jobs so I can try to get out. Can you help me with the interpretation please? What do you think splitting apart is likely to mean in this context. It says in lises page that if you are noble internally, it can mean improvement.   ""Lay bare what is in or behind things. It is dangerous when on the outside it seems all quiet and fine, and one does not know the inside. And when things do not work the way they should, then find out if there is something rotten behind the scene.   And also: the outside of things decays some day, but if there is a strong and true inside, this will survive and find a new form. The ripe fruit of the top line is not eaten, it will rot away. If there is a noble inside - the seeds - it is an improvement or progress. If there is no good inside - the small man, no seeds - it falls apart and nothing remains.""Or is it likely to mean the failure of my business or finding a new job. Or just that I will continue to find it exhausting. Any thoughts will be helpful and appreciated. Thank you."

1412,"A few months ago, I befriended a man who is very similar to myself.  So similar to me, that elements in our history or the ways we are make me feel as though I'm looking into a mirror at times.  I realize that this relationship with him has a much higher purpose than your run of the mill infatuation.  I have grown and learned so much about myself by seeing my behavior reflected back at me through this man, Terry.  I have been awakened and as a result, have begun the healing process in many different aspects of my life.  For this, I'll be eternally grateful for our paths to have crossed.  In my elementary understanding of the IC, it appears as though from my castings that it is telling/showing me this undeniable fact that the relationship is to help me heal and find joy and love within myself.As both of us have had long-term serious relationships that resulted in our ""other half"" cheating, behaviors and relating to each other at times is a bit dysfunctional.  We are both afraid of getting too close to someone and experiencing that level of pain once again.  About a month ago, Terry decided to distance himself from me (the conversation was odd, but understandable in light of this fear of intimacy).  However, since then, we've talked and texted each other and it's still apparent the spark is still there on both sides of the conversation.  I'm more reserved and find myself keeping my feelings a little more to myself (thanks to the IC recommending I do so and after the decision was made to take some space from one another).I believe we're both working through our individual paths to healing, and in my case, I feel stronger now than I have in years.  In addition to working through the past relationship issues, I am working through things that have plagued me my entire adult life (thanks Mom and Dad for teaching me how to be just as messed up as you).  I am healthier, but know I still have a way to go on this journey.  However, at this point, I think that I could be ready to stand beside someone on their path and walk together to find that healthy place to enjoy one another in a relationship.I don't know if that person to join me is Terry, but I thought I'd see if it is a possibility.  Here are a few castings - I'd love to know your interpretations.What is our long term potential?  8 unchangingWill we restart our relationship in April?  50.1 > 14What romantic actions can I expect next from him?  41.5 > 61Are both of us making positive changes in our lives that will bring us together?  22.1.6 > 15As both of us met via an internet dating site and we both have profiles on various dating sites.  I recently noticed after the times we've communicated in the past two weeks that Terry started ""taking down"" or hiding his profiles, one at a time.  So, I asked ""Why is he hiding his profiles?"" and received Hex. 20, unchanging.Seeing what I perceived as a positive sign, I went for broke and asked a silly question.  ""Will Terry and I restart things by this weekend?""  There is an event that could potentially bring us together, so I thought, ""why not?""  I received 31.2.3.5 > 64.  In a nutshell, I see advice to stay cool as he is evaluating things (hex 20) and that we are making progress in our individual lives (22.1.6 > 15) that could bring us closer to one another.  I also see that he's attracted (hex 61) and there is a potential for long term (hex's 8 and 31.2.3.5).  Am I reading this correctly, or am I way off and he's a horrible, mean man who's gonna use me...or it's completely over and he hates me?    I fear putting up my interpretations, as I could be totally delusional about what's going on here....Thanks for your thoughts in advance!"

It took me seven years to get over that loss and then i met a man who was also a widower. His wife comited suicide and he was no where near healed from the event. I helped him through his issues with his loss but he didn't feel he could stay with meHe felt that he needed to be with someone from his own culture and he went off looking for a new wife. At this point he is with her but i have heard their path is rocky. He has not married her as of yet. My problem is I am still in love with him and I cannot seem to get him out of my heart. I asked the i ching, "" Will he ever come return to me?""And i got this... Hexagram 50 third line changing to hexagram 18Believe me it's not the first time i have asked The i ching has been patient with me because i feel that although I am struggling with my pain.

I started dancing and I am getting into my creative side to pull myself out of the sadness i experienced over the loss of this relationship.

We're again split as we still live in the two countries but now the wish to actually keep the contact seems more serious from both sides.I've asked IC about the future of the relationship and got hex 31 unchanging.

Hexagram 35 has always seemed very positive and encouraging but line 4 talks about cunning ways and amassing great possessions in a greedy manner... I'm not getting it at all....

1420,"Hi all,I posted a few months ago about a man. Since then our relationship blossomed into something. It’s still very new. This week I had to board a plane for a 3-mo trip in another hemisphere. I wasn’t happy about doing it bc I really did not want to leave him or our relationship behind. IN fact, am considering cutting it short…Since my arrival he seems to be treating me more platonically. I am not sure if his feelings have changed, if he’s scared, or trying to protect himself, or if this is just the way it is. I am torn between telling him how it makes me feel and stepping further away to give him an extra long leash. In short I don’t know what’s going on exactly, or how to react to it. I feel uneasy & would like some reassurance from him. By the same token I don’t think assurance is worth anything if you have to tell someone you want it.How should I relate to Him now, given how I’m feeling? 40.2.6 and 35.Show me a picture of his emotional connection to me. 17.1.3.5 and 62. (Note: the same answer came to the question “show me a picture of if I tell him I miss him.” My question is about me expressing deeper feelings when he *may* be scared,changing his mind, feeling otherwise, etc. I do not want to pressure him esp if we are not on the same page now.)The 17 concerns me. That means he is following my example, no? In which case, if I want more communication I should step forward? But usually the Yi is not supportive of the woman doing that (and  I am not into being the “man” in the relationship either)…As for 40, the issue of letting go: letting go of the tension inside me, the worry about how he’s feeling (Ie it’s all OK, nothing to worry about?) OR let go of him/this relationship??Any insights here would be most helpful.Thanks, -E."
1421,"first I asked does XYZ like me or think about me, and I got 52.1.3then I asked: is a healthy loving relationship in my future?and I gothex 14 no lines..does anyone have any input they would like to share, please?"
1422,"Hi there, I applied for a job recently and I did a reading on how things will go and whether I will get the job. I got the hexagram number 6 song - conflict with no changing lines. However I was feeling in a dark moment when i did the reading. I find sometimes being in a bad state of mind when doing readings can get negative outcomes. So I cleared my mind and did another one asking for advice for the job interview. This time I got 14 ta yu - possession in great measure with no changing lines. So my question is, do other people subscribe to the view that a dark state of mind can influence a reading and therefore a second reading with a clear state of mind will be more accurate. I have read that you should have a clear mind to do a reading. But I have also read that the first reading should be the most accurate and you shouldnt do a second.

1423,"Inspired by another poster's question and my recent relationship struggles I asked the yi""why is it so hard for me to find a boyfriend?'I received Hex 46 unchanged.Hex 46 Pushing Upward Pushing upward has supreme success.One must see the great man.Fear not.Departure toward the southBrings good fortune.What does it mean when the texts says ""one must see the great man?""I'm reading this as to just accept things as they are.  and that I shouldn't worry and that I should continue to take small steps to further my self growth.  That every step counts and is just as important as the desired result. I know that I have been pushing through patterns that have gotten me in to the wrong relationships in the past.  Looking closely as to why I choose the wrong men.  I’ve changed a lot of my behavior by taking a more receptive role to dating (I used to be quite needy and clingy).  Now I respond rather than initiate and this has saved me a lot of man-pain.  So perhaps 46 tells me to keep going, stay on the path and realize that I’m making progress?"
1424,"Hi there!Been lurking for a while now, and this is my first post.  I absolutely love this forum and the info you guys provide here.I asked the IC today about a letter that I had sent to my clients, asking for their help in finding me more business.  It was a ""from the heart"" letter, telling them briefly about the transition my life had been going through these past six months.  Most of these clients do not know what has happened to me.I told them that I needed to build up my business more now since I had split from my boyfriend of 7.5 years.  He decided that he preferred the company of an Army Colonel's wife (the Colonel is currently deployed - nice, eh?) to me six months ago.  I basically said that I was not fearful of the economy, but healing from this betrayal and figuring out my life after spending it with someone for so long is what makes me nervous.  I believe that becoming more busy and helping others through my work would help me to heal.So, I asked ""What effect will I see as a result of sending the letters?"" and got 62.1 > 55.  I believe the 62.1 is referring to the cheating ex and the situation I have come out of.  Is the 55 showing me that there will be a big surge of business suddenly for me as a result of the letter?  Or is it the ominous interpretation?Thanks for any insights you could provide!"

Recently we have been talking casually and have had pleasant exchanges via email.Since I am trying to get the hang of interpreting I Ching readings, I am throwing coins for random questions and insights and keeping a journal to improve my relationship with the hexagrams and to see any patterns in my life.Well, last night I asked Yi for insight about my interaction person. My general question was ""Show me the general atmosphere of my interactions with 'Y'""I was a bit stumped by my result: hex 24.2.3.4.5.6>1This seems like an awfully complicated reading for a person that i have barely had any interaction with. Plus, I am not sure how there could be a turning point since we have only been talking for the past two days.Maybe we will become good friends and that's what the turning point indicates? How would you view this type of result and do the large amount of lines indicate anything in particular?Thank you!:bows:"
1428,"hi all,as I can feel capable of interpreting the hexagrams of the other ....so I am cautious in interpreting what I get in response.I would like to hear your opinion about a question that I did. I state that was the first time that I did.What have I expect that she (XY) intends to make with her marriage in relation to me?""I'm not her husband""I get 24.4 ->51coincidences want it to be just the fourth line to move .... the line represent how other will re/act or just re/act.the answer should be related to the core of this question:...she (XY) intends to make...am I right?Wilhem says about this line:you are in bad company. you are aware of the possibility of a reversal became aware for the better... and more determined to pursue this direction.be aware that your friends will not follow you and that your path can be lonelythanks in advancePatrodon't worry about my bad English...."
1429,"Hello,I'm studying creativity and have been getting rather tired of the dry scientific models of the Creative process.  I came across an article that compared Western and Eastern philosophical approaches to creativity, which gave me an 'aha' moment of my very own I remembered how the I-Ching speaks of creativity throughout and I wondered how this could be extracted to form an holistic model of creativity.  After reading Carl Jung's approach to writing Richard Wilhelm's Foreword, the uncertainty led to Jung asking the I-Ching for its judgement. I decided to ask the I-Ching about my dilemma.  After tossing the coins the Hexagram 35 with 9 in the fourth was cast, could anyone please offer their interpretation?  I feel like I'm far too biased to make a fair judgement of what this means.  Any help would be gratefully recieved. "
1430,"Hey!I was talking to some people today about investment decisions (I finally started making some money so I want to invest it, as some people say ""make your money work for you, not you for it""). Anyways after being presented a lot of information and different options about the topic I decided to ask the Yi ""In what should I invest in?"" and got 27.1.2.3 > 18Now since all the lines are negative (all of them talking about seeking nourishment in the wrong places) I assume the Yi is telling me that I shouldn't invest in anything, but since this is kind of important (it is money after all), I was wondering if you guys could help me understand and ""decode"" this reading.Thanx!"
1431,"Hi,My 15 your old has never liked school even as a pre-schooler. He is popular, social, reasonable grades, the teachers like him but he says it is so boring. He has suffered from depression over the years from this and has had a lot of time off school. We have tried several different schools but it is always the same outcome.When he is at home on holidays and weekends etc. he is pretty self sufficient, social etc.He was actually very excited about going back this year but after 2 days he is almost in tears and not wanting to go back. We have disccussed home schooling which he is interested in and also employing tutors to help with the more difficult subjects.So I asked this IChingIs home schooling the right way to educate Kasey at this time?I received Hex 63.1.3>8I have read line 3 as learning without the fear of boredom or depression representing the devils and although it will be tiresome etc. he will make it. To finish his high school it wld take 3 years.have I got this right.I wld appreciate your insight as it upsets me so much to see him unhappy.blessingsMelissaLine 3Conquering the Dusk – Riding forth into the dusk with no fear of devils, he takes upon a righteous cause and devotes three years to its attainment.

1432,"dear all,I'm new to the forum and slightly obsessed with I Ching lately. I'm seriously thinking of divorcing  my husband, but I asked, since he's threatening me to take away the children from me, ""what can I expect if I decide not to separate from X"" that is try to reconcile, surrender in a certain way.And I got 19.4 changing into 54Does it mean I have to take responsability for my marriage and my actions (faults - i have them as he has) and to try reconcile even if 54 means I will always ""come second"" to something? Or since 19.4 is ‘An end nearing,No mistake.’ I should end it even if i will not be that happy afterwardsand when I asked what can i expect if I decide to divorce him I got 29.3 (I do not have to divorce?) but the bucket of the well is broken ""48""?I know I do not have to base such important decisions on I Ching .. I just want more insight, something I might overlookPlease help if you canLast edited: Mar 29, 2010"
1433,"I just got an e-mail that I have to call somebody at my school asap, because they possibly have another internship for me.And I was wondering if the IC could give me a hint of what kind of company they found for me.So far I've been working at two estate agency's and now I am  at a company that has to do with healthcare.It's all adminstrative jobs I'm doing.So I asked the IC:""What kind of company will I have my next application with?""It answered: 3.1.5>2Line 3.1 Hesitation and hindrance.It furthers one to remain persevering.It furthers one to appoint helpers.Could this company be about helping people?

1437,"I did Clarity's Flash reading and then my computer was shut down -- this happens very rarely -- so I can't get Clarity's interpretation back.  I read through many interpretations of the 29.4 with the 4 change - and it gave me some insight.  I especially saw some Members say that the Abysmal is about going into the Unknown, especially about commitment, marriage, etc.My situation is very complicated... I'm 43 years old and have not had my heart open since I left my daughter's father, my ex-husband, some 6 years ago.  I have always focused my life on the transpersonal journey and am not into all that pining energy... but anyway the bottom line is this reading is about a soul-mate from high school that has claimed to be in love with me for the past 30 years.  We have always met up at cross purposes over the years... and to be honest, we are still probably at cross purposes.  I have lived in the UK for a decade and moved back to the US with my 8y ear old daughter 1.5 years ago.  I have not seen this man for several years.  He turned up in LA last week on business, and I realized that I have pushed him away for all these years in the search of the Great Adventure.  I think I never wanted to allow myself to feel personal love for him because it would be about going back.  I therefore lectured him whenever we had our brief but maddening encounters -- that it was not me personally that he was 'loving' but rather what I symbolized.  I told myself he doesn't know ME - he only knows his 'idea' of me. This was the story I told myself for all this time.  But now I am realizing I have always rationalized this 'away' from my own personal feelings... and I'm actually shocked about it.OK I know this is way too much information!  I am very sorry about that.  There are even more complications than I've indulged you with... but I'll stop whilst I'm behind!Anyway the way I read Clarity's version was not about Danger but really some endless Flow.  Wilhelm's translation is as always very different.  Does anyone know how I can get back into Clarity's translation so I can spend more time contemplating the Advice here?  Also any ideas of what to look at more deeply, I'd be immensely appreciative.Thank you."
1438,"HI, I've been hanging around a while but never posted. I have fondness for quite a few folks on here but you don't even know me! So I asked what should be my focus for today? 14 unchanging. cool! Then 7 hours later someone tried to rob me at gunpoint. As soon as the words were coming out of my mouth (after he asked me the time), I knew what was up. As soon as he presented the gun from his waist I turned and ran because I know the neighbourhood, there are robberies all the time but never shootings and where I live the criminals aren't that tough -- I knew he wasn't going to shoot me. WHat do you all make of 14? Then when I got home I asked 'Was it okay that I ran?"" (thinking that maybe it was stupid) I received: 64.4>4Opinions?"
1439,"My question was about resolving things that seem to separate us and this hexagram is about influences and contact, and on a first glance it seems positive but with all this changing lines I get an impression that there is not much that I can really do. And I know ""doing"" something isn't really possible in such a situation but I guess the need to ask was to strong...Does any body have experience with so many moving lines in this hexagram? Any insight will be appreciated The question was:What can I do to remove the obstacles between us?Answer: 31, changing lines 3,4,5,6 > 23Background: The obstacles I mention are mostly in his view of the situation between us, I don't feel them in myself. He says he loves me but is trying to suppress it because he thinks he shouldn't be with me (age difference, that inevitably I will want to have family with children and he feels he's passed through that phase of life already and doesn't see him self in such a situation again). Love and attraction on both sides are very strong but I guess that isn't enough."

1441,"Really thought I had gotten somewhere in repairing a very old friendship/ex-relationship with a man who was very important to me for many years...  we've had a rocky and difficult time with each other for so very long and things really seemed to be settling into a genuine friendship (not super close or anything, but at least not ""hateful"" anymore...or so I thought....so I sent him a message telling him we are moving in June.  I was really hoping that we could spend some quality time before we leave, just enjoying being friends and remembering the many good things we have shared over the years...minus the sad, hurtful stuff....was so hoping to kinda leave it in a really good place so as to not feel like all the crap from all these years was a total waste....Anyway, at first he was very apathetic, like, ""good luck..wish you well...""  which did kinda hurt after everything for so many years...guess i hoped he'd kinda care even a little that we very likely will never see each other ever again (not really a *bad* thing i guess, but still..lot of time and emotions were invested in this thing, you know?!).But then after the first very apathetic generic ""wish you well"", he then came at me blasting with mean stuff and old accusations of our break up, and denying there has been any good things between us since the official split so long ago.  It was terribly disappointing and honestly, unbelievably and surprisingly hurtful  To be totally straight and forthright, I was more hurt than I can say...and surprised too, to realize I guess our relationship hasn't gotten repaired in ANY way at all even after everythingAsked the IC..why was he so mean?Response:  hex 24.1.2 changing to 7I would really appreciate any thoughts into this in relation to my question:bows:Having a tough time with most of my ""relationships"" lately it seems and I am very saddened about it....Namaste':bows:"

One of them invited me to contact them if I had any questions, etc. Waited a week, didn't hear anything (although they said they were planning on hosting second interviews hopefully during the week of 22 March), and sent one of the women (the big boss) an email, thanking her for inviting me in. In that email I included examples of my previous work for her to peruse, if she was interested.

I feel like it's supposed to be out there, being read so I've went back and really, really worked on it, changing, editing, etc...anyway my question was - What is the situation around me getting an agent for this particular book? The Yi answered 17 with changing lines 3 and 5 to 55. I'm too close to see what it's trying to tell me as I have alot, I mean ALOT, of emotion wrapped up in this situation.  I know that Line 3 means to leave the immature mindset behind and embrace the mature (maybe?) and line 5 is supposed to be very positive. But hexagram 55, does that mean 'hey this is the best you can expect' or there are many opportunities for you ahead? Please, if someone could help me with this I would be truly thankful. "

I received Hexagram 9 unchanging to my query, will he pass this test/what does he need to know or do to pass it.  He almost passed last semester,  received a score of 6 out of 7(7 passes), a big  improvement from the first time he tried when he  scored a 1! This has been a hard long road for all of us with a son who refuses to give up.  This time though, these new rules may force him out of college if he cannot get a passing grade.

1461,"For a bit of background here: Over the past few years I have given alot of thought and research into soulmates and soul companions. Those familiar with the research of Dr. Newton and the Newton Institute (books such as Life after Life, Life Between Lives etc)I believe that soulmates are not always in romantic relationships. Sometimes a soulmate can be a family member or friend..but often true soulmates like to pair up in partnerships.Ever since I met a man who impacted my life greatly and of whom I had psychic dreams (the man who I ran into by a phenomenal coincidence this past week)..I began to wonder if HE was my soulmate.But then I let go of this and in fact, hope that he is NOT as we are not together in this life and I can't imagine that even being a good choice for me, even if it was possible.So I am hoping that my soulmate is indeed on earth right now. Sometimes soul mates choose not to meet in a lifetime or two because they have grown too dependent on each other. This doesn't mean we can't have wonderful marriages with people who are not our soulmate..not at all.And our soul companions from our Primary Soul Group can bring great rewards and enrichment to our lives.I would however like to know whether or not my soul mate is in my life or coming into my life. And if not, I would then like to use meditation and Life Between Life hypo regression therapy to find out more about my purpose and Soul Group dynamics.So I am starting now to use the Iching to go deeper into my life.I concentrated and asked the Oracle and feel that it was definately communicating with me about this. As if, it is saying that these really are better questions than whether or not my ex cheated I would greatly appreciate the guidance of the group here..and your interpretations.Is my soulmate living on earth at the same time as me in this life now?38.4 Opposition/PolarizationNine in the fourth place means:Isolated through opposition,One meets a like-minded manWith whom one can associate in good faith.Despite the danger, no blame.If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he is separated by an inner opposition, he becomes isolated.

1462,"Hi,What's the time frame (weeks, months, etc) for 23.3.5>53?Many thanks."
1463,"Today I had to do a demonstration at school to show that I can properly perform the techniques taught through out the year. I am sitting on pins and needles waiting to find out how I did. So I asked the iching how I did on it and it gave me Hexagram 10, treading with lines 1 2 and 5 changing to hexagram 35. The demo was seriously nerve racking because you can screw up an entire years worth of school in just a few minutes, so the image of treading on the tail of a tiger definitely hits home. Hexagram 35 seems positive, but I know I made several mistakes and I would be extremely surprized if I passed. They do give you a second attempt at the test, but if you fail the second one, you''re out of the program for good. "
1464,"It's almost a matter of scientific enquiry by now that I am plotting what is happening in a relationship by means of the IChing and using the information that I either find or am directly given on this site.  As divined by Willow Fox, this relationship went forward last week in the manner of a ""Spring thaw"", after a year of waffling and not really moving.  We actually had a dinner together at his place, BUT lo and behold, a third person had been invited to join us midway through the evening, which I found kind of unusual, believing when I went there that this invitation was something else.  Then it dawned on me, [being fairly dense I think in relation to male behavior] that the evening was perhaps just an attempt to say ""thank you"" for kindnesses received, not necessarily any more than that.  I was rather shattered really, but over the course of three more days I've decided I have to accept reality -- if that's the true reality of the situation.To be sure what is happening, tonight, I've asked for clarification of this relationship [again, O Lord, again] in this question:  Where and how do our lives fit together, if they do?I got 35, unchanging, which I know as ""Easy Progress"" with the implication that things just sail forward, and yet, I just don't see it.  Of course I couldn't believe I'd soon be seeing advancement of the nature WF foresaw last week either.  But, unless I'm totally off base in regard to the message being sent by this dinner invitation, 35 seems VERY optimistic.  Suggestions or interpretations?  Thanks in advance for all help.Last edited: Mar 20, 2010"

1466,"A dear friend of mine really confused me this weekend.  We have spent lots of time together lately and I really think highly of her as a person and felt we were developing a really nice friendship...  We had plans for this weekend to spend time together and it just seemed strange.  I felt like she was continuously putting me down in subtle ways.  She has never behaved like this toward me before, so the first few side comments that jabbed, my initial though was, ""gosh, I'm just being too sensitive"" and of course, I just ignored them and let them pass by.  After this continued for sometime, I finally realized it couldn't possibly be happening so often and be my imagination entirely...but I just continued to ignore them.... and just wondering why this was happening.  Tried to discuss with her and *really* regretted that, as it felt as though she just turned the whole thing around on me and I actually ended up apologizing to her for reasons I still don't really know why, but for the sake of keeping peace and valuing a friendship, I figured I should pick my battles...  So Saturday while we were together, it started happening again and I was just too frustrated to deal with it anymore, so I called her out on it and stood my ground.  Well, she doesn't see that she's done anything and I'm not going to apologize again for not wanting to take jabs at my friends trivial enjoyment (?? )...  really, just don't get it at all, as she has never treated me like this before and I am hurt and sad...and confused.... we haven't spoken since Sat. evening....Asked IC what's going on with my friend and for insight into why she was treating me like that...Response:  hex 56.1.3.6 to hex 51.Some of these lines seem to directly relate to this.  Trivial concerns...I did try to ignore it hoping it would cease...but one can only take that for so long before thinking something deeper is prompting this out of the blue like that...Any thoughts on this?

1468,"HiHere I am with another relationship question.i have been in a bit of an off and on relationship now for a while.This is with a girl i have had a relationship with a good while ago.The feelings seem to be there, and the communication is great, but we've had trouble trusting the relationship not to turn out as it did last time.As it is now it does not seem as if it will turn out to anything but when I asked if i should get involved with her a 100% as my feelings would have it I got:20. (9 on top)  > 8the 20 does seem to describe the situation right now, with the back and forth and the need to look into oneself, but the 8 seem to suggest coming together, love?is this us? someone else?Does it speak of a different relationship with someone else?I'd appreciate your thoughts on this"
1469,"I'm not sure I should ask this but I will anyway.  I very much appreciate the support of the community here, on my threads and on the threads of so many others that i've been reading.  I've asked qhestions about the same man before and the general concensus is that there's nothing there.  I accept that pretty much.  I take music lessons from him and some months ago he had started this conversation about relationships, and me being probably clinically phobic about getting involved in those I froze, said something jaded about them and changed the subject.  I've had this stupid crush on him ever since.  I use the music lessons to 1. learn music which I love tremendously, 2. learn to be around someone I have a crush on.  It almost doesn't matter that it never goes anywhere.  But over time he's become much friendlier and we hang out a bit after lessons.  The fact that he isn't interested is actually a huge comfort, despite being perpetually disappointed about it.  Yesterday was a day when I thought there could be something there.  When he didn't show up to meet me when he was supposed to, I expressed my concern/worry about him to him because I knew he was having a health issue.  He seemed to genuinely appreciate my concern saying he needed someone in his life to worry about him.  Today though he didn't seem particularly into my being there and didn't encourage me to hang out after the lesson so today I'm completely convinced there's nothing and never was anything.  So its always up and down like that for me.  I could stop taking lessons from him, but I really want to face this and learn to be calm/peaceful in these situations.  Because I'm certain I say and do things to push people away when I get so nervous like this.I'd like to believe one thing or the other and Yi isn't helping.  In fact Yi is egging me on.With wishful thinking I asked if there is any fate between us.  Something that is ment to be? to which I got 11.1.3 to 7.  Peace is an interesting hex, seems to suggest that we have a lot in common or are somehow attached, but are prone to ups and downs.  I'm not sure how 7 would fit into this.  There doesn't seem to be any real answer in this toss except to say that we are attracted to one another.I asked again today after feeling disappointed and wanting a definitive answer so I could set my heart on that course and find peace.  If I have to settle with being close aquaintences I could find peace, I just have to believe it completely.  So my question was specifically what was the chance of finding love/ a relationship with him?Yi said 11.5>5..  marriage possibilities if I just wait?  Why does Yi tease me like this!!  Its enough to make me drop iChing permanently.  Is Yi trying to get rid of me?  No looking to Yi to get myself off the razors edge of trying to find peace while liking someone.  I guess this is a case where Yi is showing a sense of humor."

1472,"Hello, everyone, I'm sorry I couldn't come up with a bit more imaginative name for this thread! I believe that i could use some help or, to be more precise, your impressions on a specific questions and the accompanying hexagram.Here's the thing: I'm not an I-ching reader but a Horary astrologer. Close enough, aye?!  And I have been analysing one Horary chart cast upon a Question asked by a female Querent this autumn for which the definite outcome is still not known.  I must say that i am very interested in I-.ching but I have never asked for a confirmation of my readings in any other divination technique. The truth is, I'm not doing it now either but it turns out that this client of mine is very fond I-ching and that she apparently double-checks all of astrological analyses with her I-ching reader and the other way around  . But, even more importantly, this time, I believe that both me and her I-ching reader are having troubles convincing her that the readings cannot be altered and that she should finally ""buy"" what we  are trying to ""sell"" her.  Well, sort of speaking anyway. Now, whilst it very common to have multiple conversations with clients who, unsatisfied with what they hear, tend to continously try to pull out a positive answer from a negative chart, this time, oddly enough, I believe I have the opposite situation as this Querent is very, very sceptical about my reading (or, should I say, our readings) that is actually very promising and positive.I'm not saying that she is wrong because, for what it's worth, we can all make a mistake but the truth is, i've been scratching my head over this chart for quite a few months and I still don't think that I can find a single sign of a possible negative outcome whilst the Querent is becoming more and more desperate. In autumn, when she first asked the Question, she admitted that she had already visited an I-ching reader and said that our readings were both very optimistic and alike. i didn't ask for any details at the time Unfortunately, last week, she ended up being very disappointed by the whole situation and wanted me to cast a new chart. But I had to tell her that it wasn't possible as Horary charts have a specific period of validity and, unles the circumstances had significantly changed (which they had not), she should rely upon her first reading. She then said that she had asked a new I-ching question  and that the situation, apparently, still looked promising only that she could not find a single reason in reality to support that. At that point I kindly asked her to share the results of her I-chin reading wirth me which she did. I am very, very interested in hearing as to what exactly an i-ching reader could have told her because we obviously agree that the general tone of the situation si very positive (and here I might have to add that this is really one of the most promising Horary charts that i have seen in a a very long time).Ok, so, the Question was asked by a female Querent, single and 32yo . She wanted to know if there was any romantic potential between her and a particular man whom she had been noticing for  quite some time only whom she had never actually met.  As some of you might know, Horary charts provide very thorough descriptions of situations with many details and additional informations which i will skip here but I will, of course, share my reading in general with you. her plan was to visit him in his firm as a client because it seemed like a good way to get to know him better (or at all) and was interested in hearing as to how the situation might start developing from there. According to the Querent, the man seemed to be more than interested in her as well. My answer after the  chart delineation was done was that her idea was actually very good as the encounters on his territory (home, office etc.) seemed like the best posible choice and that it would be a great place to organise their first meeting. The mutual affection between the two of them was more than obvious and the situation looked very promising. The way to his heart (and body! ) WAS open and the chart was clearly suggesting that a strong relationship might be born soon.  I finally had a chart where the two people from the Question might actually end up being together which, unfortunately,  isn't  all that common thing in our practice. I couldn't find a single sign of his coldness, rejection or of the  lack of interest on his side. The only thing that i was sure of was that there was going to be some sort of delay and that the things would not start moving until mid-February or, even more likely, mid-March.Just around that time, she finally decided to  go over there and to meet him. She phoned me when she got back home and she was more than disappointed. She said that she only spent about 15min there, that he didn't seem interested in  her and that he even said that he could not help her ( she thought that she would hire him for a specific project) which only sealed her main impression of a cold man who is not at all interested in her.The only thing that I, as an astrologer , now have, is that same old chart. Something that her I-ching reader has, is indeed a new reading but, according to the Querent, with the same final hexagram as the first time (I am not surprised to hear that, it happens in Horary astrology all the time). So, basically, i have a confirmation of my old reading in that i-ching reading because, since I decided to take this information seriously, the things have obviously not changed a bit and our client just might be a bit too impatient. but still, i would really appreciate your impressions and thoughts on this hexagram .She says that the result was: hexagram 11 with changing lines 1,4,6 resulting in hexagram 50.So, what would you, as I-ching readers,  say if you'd gotten this result for a question regarding a romantic potential between two people? Thank you in advance!aglayaLast edited: Mar 22, 2010"
1473,"So...I have this very strange relationship with a guy.  I guess I'd call it a CHS- Consecutive Hookup Situation.  Every time we are in the same place we end up hooking up and feeling a very deep connection- physically, emotionally, intellectually, artistically.  However, we live on opposite sides of the country, and he travels around the world frequently to boot.  In addition, he is involved in a relationship that is quite sticky (his partner is his accompanist for recitals); and I have been involved with him professionally both as a student and as a colleague in various situations.  I'm quite honest with myself and the situation knowing that there is nothing to expect as far as a committed/monogamous relationship goes (honestly, it's hard for me to understand why he even bothers being in a ""serious"" relationship to begin with).  I have applied to a summer program of study in which he is the judge of who gets to go.  Last year I was one of two selected, without even sending in application materials  This year I sent in a very good package that I worked hard on.  I also have some general questions about my field of study.  This man has not responded to any of my emails (maybe about 5 or 6?) sent intermittently between the end of November and now (mid/end March).  He also hasn't returned the 3 or 4 messages I've left on his phone.This guy is VERY notorious in our field for not returning calls/emails promptly, but often with me he has picked up right away in the past.  So I am wondering what is going on, and asked ""Why hasn't J returned any of my calls or emails since November"" and got 49.4 changing to 63.I am very confused how this one applies and could use some help.  Especially with 63- not sure if this means the matter is closed (he doesn't want to deal with me as all anymore, neither as a lover nor student nor colleague), or not.  Seems like the common sense answer to what is going on.  Or if I should continue to contact him within reason, not being super annoying, perhaps this is a way to get some of the desired results (advice for my studies, find out whether or not I will have to make arrangements to be out of town for a month this summer, maintain friendship/relationship).  49.4 points to radical changes and maintaining integrity, or so I see it.  Well, that is not a problem as I am in my field working hard to learn more, become more versatile, and get gigs!  Perhaps he doesn't see it as such [yet]?  Thoughts?"
1474,"I wrote to the district attorney and report crime, it has been investigation and now I m waiting for decision of district attorney.I ask Yi; how can I convince district attorney to stay on my side and I get 60.5 to 19.How to interpret it?"
1475,"Hello everyone,I just want to thank those that helped me through these recent hurdles for their kind wisdom and incredible insight. You guys have greatly benefited me and I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to help.If you're interested, I just wanted to let you all know what's transpired since the two previous posts I've made ""Line of Doom (29.4.6 > 6)"" and ""Move Back Home (39.3>8, 37"".OK, I seriously gave up. I was SO over it. My life was in shambles, I was weary, and I had absolutely no resolve, inner strength or motivation to attempt to rectify my situation anymore. I was prepared to move back home with my mom and get a job as a used car salesman or something. And then Thursday happened.I woke up stupid early in the morning this past Thursday, defeated. I asked the I Ching whether or not it could even slightly be possible to be successful in my industry (publishing/writing) if I moved back home to L.A. (where film is dominant and book publishing is fairly nonexistent--I live in London now). I got 51.4>55, ""Shocking"" turning to ""Zenith/Abundance"". I took that as a great sign that I would do OK back home, once I got there. But then, I had no idea what was going to transpire throughout the rest of the day.Got to work, bummed, thinking about how I was going to break the news to my bosses that I was planning on returning home. I had to drop off some posters to a photographer for a photo shoot for some book I'm working on, as soon as I got in. Met with the photographer at a train station: he was the most awesome person on earth. We had some coffee, made great conversation; his presence made me feel so much better about everything, his positivity was infectious. What a great human being.Returned to the office and WHOA: as soon as I stepped in a really awesome guitarist from one of the BIGGEST, most LEGENDARY BANDS ON THE PLANET was sitting in my office, discussing a book proposition with my boss. I met the man, shook his hand and, again, he was one of the most magnificent human beings EVER. That was THRILLING.Then, after he left and we all returned to the humdrum, my bosses followed up with a publisher that was ""seriously considering"" a book proposal I pitched to him at one of last year's book fairs (a book which I and a friend may be writing, if pushed forward). He got back immediately saying they're ""interested"" and that they needed more info on the market AND they were asking my bosses about schedules, asking when the book could potentially be delivered. Another serious WHOA.Then, an hour after this, a publisher who rejected my book proposal (I REALLY wanted them to take it specifically, but the sales people said they didn't know how they could sell it, so the editors had to reject it) randomly called and I just HAPPENED to pick up the phone. Long story short, they rejected one of my bosses' proposals because they couldn't sell enough of that title. We learned a lot about their market after this phone call and my boss asked me to come up with three ideas for titles, specifically geared towards this publisher, for me to pitch at the upcoming book fair next month.OH, it doesn't stop there: I submitted one of my poems to this literary magazine months ago. They rejected it. The magazine collects poems and then commissions illustrators to create a piece in response to the poem. My poem was written for their ""liberate"" theme, and it was about a brain trying to break through the skull, navigating through synapses, in essence, liberating one's self from the mind. Checked out their website randomly and, GUESS WHAT? The COVER of the issue of the magazine which rejected my poem is a BRAIN trapped in a corset with nerve endings dangling down. Like, WHAT? Sorry, I don't think I'm an egomaniac, but I find this extremely uncanny.I was really worried about my mom's health and that was eating away at me internally. She called me in the evening to let me know that she visited the doctor and that she has a clean bill of health. Her symptoms were all due to menopause. YAY! What fantastic news!In light of all these signposts, I asked the I Ching the next day whether all of this new energy could actually signify success with publishing/writing. I got 1.1>44. I get it, the dragon is underwater. I'm just going to have to do my thing behind the scenes until the dragon is unleashed into the world.Submitted one of my pieces to a really awesome lit magazine this same day and, they rejected it, because the editor ""didn't get what I was trying to do"". Although she liked the beginning, she said the piece ""degenerated"" towards the end and that it wasn't a good fit for their magazine. I found ""degenerated"" a bit insulting. My stuff is pretty experimental, and what I submitted to them was a flash fiction piece, under 500 words, anchored in loads of poetic device. I didn't think that being clear necessarily did the piece justice, but I took her advice and asked my writer friends for feedback. I replied to her, thanking her for her time and feedback. Anyway, in response to the rejection I asked, ""I'm not Hemingway, but I'm an OK writer, I think. Am I delusional? Will I ever get published?"" I got 22 ""Grace"" unchanging.Anyway, sorry for the longwinded update. Again, I just want to thank everyone for providing me with such incredible advice and insight. You really helped me improve myself and I appreciate you all so much.I don't know what's going to happen. Don't care anymore. I'm going to do the best I can with what I've got going on. Provide what is needed, keep writing and just let go and let the universe. My work's at least inspired a few people thus far (musician friend's writing songs, people drawing stuff in response to it), so, even if five people are feeling the love, that is incredibly fulfilling and I appreciate that profoundly. We'll see what goes down in the future.Infinite love to you all, thanks again.  xx"

1477,"Hi again guys,This is the second post I have submitted in 2 days . .  there's just so much to learn with the I Ching!I'm wondering what your thoughts are on specific moving lines.  For example, if you get hex 12 with lines 3,4,5 and 6 all changing, does this signify a CHANGE in the standstill as in does this often mean that the standstill is nearly over and that you are moving AWAY from hex 12?  I have rarely found that the relating hex signifies a future outcome although obviously this has not always been the case.  For me it varies every time, whether it be symbolic of how things are now, or perhaps if I act in a way that the relating hex is symbolic of then the changing lines in the primary hex may then manifest etc.I would be keen to hear your thoughts . .

So I asked .....""Why would he hesitate or cautiously?""I got 53.1.4 > 13 which I assume is about wanting to make gradual progress the natural proper way but I've seen various interpretations of this line so I'm not going to try to work this one out.......any help is appreciatedI also asked ""Do I need to do anything more at this stage or should I just wait?""I got Hex 13.3.6 changing to 1713 & 17 often confuse me! 13.3 talks about mutual mistrust and alienation?? which doesn't really make sense because we only met the once (in an industry workshop) and seemed to get on fine. Plus I've asked for advice so I can't quite place this.....13.6 talks about lack of warm attachment OR someone being sent to distant lands while the other weeps (he is going overseas soon to direct a film for several months so this might fit in.....but what's the advice?? and what's 17 about?Any input would be greatly appreciated as always and feel free to ask more questions if it helps....ThanksSofia "
1486,"Hi, Yet another ridiculous situation I need to deal with.So the story goes almost a year my son borrowed 2 plastic storage boxes worth about au$20-$30 from my ex-husband and his partner and now all of a sudden they want them back. I don't know whether its relevant but they have enough money to buy a warehouse full of plastic storage boxes.Not thinking twice about it we used them to store things long term about 4 weeks ago and they are in a storage shed until whenever.As this appears to be an ongoing theme for them of what appears to be 'how can I annoy the crap out of her'(me), just when I think they have moved on and forgotten I actually exist they come up with something else.Previous to this I have just thought 'whatever' and given in to whatever demand they are on about, but this time I have thought 'after this what next, I am just so over it'.Unfortunately my son is always in the middle of it because there is no communication with them in any way. See previous threads if you would like to know why but basically it is because of abuse towards me from them.So.....my son just wants me to go to the storage shed unpack the boxes and give them back just to he doesn't have to deal with it.I have said to him to just tell them ""he has passed the msge on and don't speak to me(him) about it again"" or anything else that doesn't concern him, as I am just going to ignore the request because otherwise it will just come up again and again about whatever bee they have in their bonnet at the time.So I asked What is the best action to take in regards to the boxes?Hex 18.2>52   This to me says Do nothing(52) and whatever troubles I(mum) have caused by not standing firm before he will no longer have to deal with.Right?I have now asked why are the return of these boxes so importantHex 57.2.3.6>8   this makes no sense whatsover to me.Blessings,MelissaLast edited: Mar 19, 2010"
1487,"(1)Oracle the destiny between S and me? Hexagram 18 unchangingThere is decay and rot. The source of it must be found for regeneration. It is imperative that this rot must be corrected.Great care must be taken before and after the correction. My conclusion here – there is decay that must be worked on.(2)Please point me to the decay that I must work on?Hexagram 21 unchangingBite through the obstacle with determination. The obstacle may be tenacious (as perceived by me perhaps).The fear of biting through the obstacle might then be my fear of biting through itself.My conclusion here – Either the I Ching is encouraging me to work on the decay. Or it is pointing that my fear of biting through the decay is itself the decay.(3)Is it correct to understand that obstacles must be cleared if S and I should come together?Hexagram 18.2 > 5218.2 – There is corruption. It is the mother’s pestilence. I must put myself in the situation to find and articulate the obstacles and from there find the way. I note that hexagram 18 also recalls the death of illness of the parent. I find it pertinent to my situation as the degeneration of our relationship started at the point S’ mother fell gravely ill. My conclusion here - Perhaps then that the I Ching is giving me a hint as to the point at which to start.(4)(Based on a letter I have drafted to S) Will I fix the decay with this latest letter that I’ve drafted?Hexagram 14.2.3.6 > 5114.2 suggests the letter will not be a mistake.14.6 suggests that there is a greater force helping.14.3 however says that small people are not in the position to make the offering. It is a mess of the heirachy and sequence. It correlates with hexagram 38.3 -  here, again, the position is wrong. It will be disadvantageous in the beginning, it will have an advantageous end. The resulting hexagram is 51 – here, there is something of a huge vibration. Ordinarily, nobody is prepared with a huge vibration. But as it is inevitable, the I Ching advises one to learn to maintain calm nevertheless. My conclusion here – Yes I will fix the decay by this way. Learn to cultivate calmness in the upheaval that will come.(5)I am confused – can I take time on this?Hexagram 2.2.4 > 402.2 says that The path is the correct one. 2.4 advises to tighten the pockets/pouch. It is not worthy of praise, but it avoids disaster. Perhaps it encourages caution so as to prevent disaster. My conclusion here – Exercising caution is good.(6)How is he feeling now in relation to this relationship?Hexagram 61.1.2.5.6 > 2The first thing that strikes me is that there are 4 changing lines. So the resulting 2 is the state of things that is quickly coming into place. Hexagram 2 is the supporting cast – not the main leader – the lead actor is hexagram 1.  2 is also earth, the earth is the basis upon which all things grow, hence the idea of fertility. 2 is also receptivity. Now to the changing lines61.1 says that the official’s has faith and it has not changed from the beginning to end.61.2 gives the idea of sharing. The white crane and the little crane both harmoniously sing that there is wine and they would like to share it with the other. The wish is true.61.5 suggests that the position is suitable and correct.61.6 The birds are chirping so loudly the noise reaches the heavens. There is danger. How can this situation last for long? My conclusion here – He is receptive. His receptivity will not last for long.________________I asked these questions over a period of time. Didn't rush into them. What do you think of my understanding here. In interpreting, I used mostly a chinese I Ching book which sets out the 象传 (xiang zhuan) and interpretations of it. A little more context and background is that I met S more than a year ago overseas. We fell in love. Its a long distance relationship. He is in a country that is very backward, it is even hard to get onto internet. Because of his work, he is also completely out of network (phone and email) for a stretch of time. The relaitonship has degenerated since the time his mom fell gravely ill - i did not receive emails and calls from him and panicked. I allowed my mind to take over - there was fear of losing him, my mind also entertained many horrible scenarios - needless to say, the actions (translated from this undisciplined mind) are possessory. Fast forward to today - he has not contacted me for a long while. I still send him weekly emails. I would be grateful if anybody can comment on the situation / my interpretation of the situation. Especially willowfox, gene, answeredquestions and lucia - all of those who spent time helping me the last time."
1488,"Hello,This is a romantic issue. There's someone I like again, but I find the concept of playing hard to get and being demure etc impossible. Once I like someone properly, I think they know it pretty soon. I don't keep them guessing - a well known successful tactic I know. But maybe when it really, finally is the/a right person - it doesn't matter how you interact because you always want to? But I think by being too needy, as well as turning away the wrong ones, you can turn away the right ones - personal tragedy possibly!?Basically when I feel a connection with someone I find it hard not to share my enthusiasm. When I was compelled to with this guy earlier, I asked the I ching for the go-ahead:hex 7I interpreted this as send in the army to support - well it would certainly be an expression of support/encouragement for him as a person!To be sure I asked again, should I express this enthusiasm or sober myself up and wait until the ball's firmly in my court?27.4 - 21I'm the hungry tiger alright!  But the yi says 'there is nothing wrong in such zeal',so I let myself follow my feelings and sent him an email...Now of course, I think well , you've done it again! Too eager. But then am I not also just following my Dao - my nature to want to give? Or is it my hungry ego wanting attention?I asked the I ching:What am I doing wrong in my approach to him? (for there must be something because I do want a relationship... not with just anyone though!)28.3,6 > 6I guess this reflects how I push things too quickly? Lean too much on the possibility of my 'dreams coming true'? But then line 6 talks of the necessity for risk taking because at the end of the day, there are more important things than being in a relationship? (Even though that seems top of most people's agendas...)How would he like me to act?32.1,3,6 > 38I think not to hurry things (probs too late) and expect everything at once (commitment, engagement ring... lol...), to remain consistent and dependable? (I am that - don't think he can be in any doubt that I'm interested/sincere - but lack of mystery isn't attractive/challenging enough to maintain interest??) and again that I am not restless and demanding of him...38 - Independence, going different directions... he wants me to leave his path maybe? Or act as if I am - play hard to get. But games aren't tao are they?As a result of my actions, what potential is left? (I haven't declared love or anything even close to that by the way - just friendly)Hex 39 - Road blocked. Well it is also a long distance thing...Have I drained him of 'desire' or interest?Hex 15 unchanging My results have toned down his interest?How does he feel about me? (sorry for all these - I really am trying to feel philosophical about this rather than despairing - after all it's happened before. More fish in the sea... though I only think a handful that could be right for you...)Hex 44 - the domineering woman - a temptation resisted? Or could I read this in a good way? lol...Finally, a general one on my 'seduction' style.I think maybe I am too obvious and thus remove the mystery/intrigue too early into the game... give too much away??Do I need to tone down my enthusiasm in matters of relationships?58.1,2,4,6 > 20I think this may mean that it is good to exchange with others if you and the other are sincere and find joy together, but that you shouldn't allow it to be a vain pleasure? That you should also pause for thought and not allow another person to be your whole source of joy and nourishment? It's hard though once you get a taste of that sort of happiness....I know this is a long one but advice would be much appreciated! I want to save my love-life before it's too late...:bows:"

1490,"Hi Everyone,My boyfriend and I are on a hiatus since January when we made the mutual decision to split because he didn't know what he wanted. The history is that he is a divorcee, the divorce is due to be final in April and back in January after he finally moved from living with a roommate to living in his own apartment, alone for the first time in ten years..he began to be confused and depressed and not sure if he should carry through with his divorce.Considering that when we met he was already seperated and that we had the biggest romance I have ever had..it was gutting to me that he started to have doubts. He had spent the previous six months telling me that I am the love of his life.He had asked for time to figure things out back in November and we took two weeks off. But I couldn't handle the insecurity so I told him ""now or never"". He broke down in tears and said ""now! will you take me back?""We got back together but it wasn't right. I realize now that I should not have pushed this at that time. But I was hurt and confused and wanted to protect myself.So in Jan when this behaviour started again I told him ""I can't take this. I feel that you are misleading me and being dishonest and it's killing me"".He left his office that day and came home to his apartment where I was and we spent three hours having our ""breakup"" discussion. He cried hard and so did I. But he said he feels unable to make a clear decision.Since then we talked once on the phone in Feb. During the conversation I told him that perhaps we were not meant to be together. He said ""it's not all over yet, we can't know that yet"". I asked him if he wanted to meet for coffee and he said, ""no, it is too soon. If I see you I won't be able to clear my mind and that is what I need to do"".Now friends are telling me to move on, to forget about him. One friend tells me ""oh I feel you will meet someone special soon""I finally wrote to him this past Sunday and told him that I need closure. That I can't keep living in this limbo, lingering. That we should meet to have final closure. He answered that if that is what I need, OK but that he doesn't see how anything he can say could make a difference because he has already told me that he needs time.I think he missed the point? That I need FINAL closure? Or maybe he just doesn't want to acknowledge it.He told me ""ok we can meet in about three weeks"". So I have been focusing my mind on moving on and on imagining a new person who will be good for me.But when I asked the I ching""Will I meet someone new who I will have a relationship with soon?"" It answered""HOlding Together - subject seeks union but no chance"" and something about moving forward with the toes""I got frustrated and asked again ""Will I meet someone new?""And it said ""the subject is not up to the task ..there will be no success""!! (I forgot what hex this was)This took the wind out of my sails as I needed something to give me a confidence boost.But then I thought I would enquire a bit more and ask the Iching what I should do then.So I asked, ""Are you telling me that I should be open to working this relationship out if possible?""And it said26 Taming the Power of the Great leading to 19 ApproachThe lines3 and 63 shows the subject urging his way with good horses. It will be advantageous for him to realize he difficulty of his course, and to be firm and correct, exercising himself daily in his charioteering and methods of defense; then there will be advantage in whatever direction he may advance6 The sixth The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition forces it's way out and achieves success. This refers to a man who is honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the world.""One attains the way of heaven."" Truth works in the great.So I am confused because I thought that line six is about moving on. But considering the total context and the very clear negative answers I got about trying to move on..I am really confused.I love him for sure but if he loved me so much, how could he do this? Everytime I ask the iching it says ""he insist on his restfulness""Okkee dokeeSo should I move on or not?"
1491,"Hi!I thought it interesting that only recently someone else through a 18.2 as well, although on a different topic. I've been working overseas for a year now, and due to the global recession have not been able to find a job in my profession. I have a job (which I am very grateful for!) but it is very very dull, and draining. I've been doing an online course in Graphic Design, which I've found to be a wonderful inspiring thing in my days... indeed at high school I excelled at art, but I didn't continue with it. I felt I needed a ""real"" job, whatever that is. I am considering returning home and taking on a two year course at university in Graphic Design, and I asked the I ching ""What if I took the two-year diploma at x?""I got 18.2 changing to 52, which has made me reflect on my career decisions as a young person (I was very concerned about money due to my own difficult childhood... I thought art was a risk). I can see that the course would be in many ways a re-enlivening thing, that I would discover a way forward with my career (which I desire so desperately given my current job circumstances). Given, perhaps, if I can reflect upon my own emotions towards wanting success and achievement (line 2)?Changing to 52, perhaps I will find peace finally with my career.... or the happiness to keep still and stop moving (which I have done many many times since leaving home at 17... it's been hard for me not to move for work or to seek out something better for my life).  Does anyone have an insight?"
1492,"I recently started communicating with someone that, to be honest, I never expected to hear from again. Everyone knows ""the one that got away"", well this is mine lol. The only girl I've ever managed to stay with for more than a month... and ever really connected with for that matter... It's been 5 years since we've communicated aside from occasional comments on Facebook, then one day this past December I offer my number, say get ahold of me sometime, and she does... Never expected it, but there ya go. Only problem is, I get the feeling she doesn't fully trust me. She's agreed to get together, but we haven't made it happen yet... it's hard to explain... it feels like there's some apprehension. So tonight I asked the Yi for advice.""What must I do to help bring us together?""The answer I got was 59.1.5 > 41I honestly haven't been coming on strong or anything, I'm trying to feel my way as I go, because I'm afraid of taking a wrong step or boldly rushing ahead. Everytime I think about this situation I get the feeling that there's something I haven't done... some THING that I'm supposed to figure out in order to move past this stalemate.... I feel like I'm being given a second chance, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do! lol  think, think, think...So 59 is about dispersion that leads to gathering together? There's some tension that needs to be dispersed, I know, but what's the key?!?! What's the rallying point in line 5??? Because that's the thing I've been looking for since the beginning of 2010... It's always there, on the tip of my tongue and at the edge of my vision, but I can't make it out..."
1493,I just wanted to get some opinions on a rather confusing answer I received today.  I consulted the iching and asked 'why hasn't X happened yet?' and received hexagram 1 unchanging.  I interpreted it to mean that there is a lot of creative energy running through the situation and it may manifest soon.  Although from reading other threads on hexagram 1 some take it as stagnant - energy not going anywhere.  I would really like some opinons on what this could mean.  Thanks.
1494,Could one of you lovely people please tell me how significant all lines changing for hex 11 are please?  I hope it's a positive reading as opposed to a negative . . . ?Thank you so much!Warmest WishesClaire
1495,"Any help members of the community would be willing to offer with respect to interpretation of the Yi's responses to my questions would be most gratefully appreciated.I broke off the platonic friendship I have been having with my former partner two weeks ago. I did this openly, honestly and peacefully. I recognized I could not move on in my life while still loving him and wanting more. The inner conflict was creating too much inner tension for me. He was present on his terms.  We most definitely had good times--dating as friends, but I want a full relationship. He likes things the way they are with limited commitment and intimacy, stating he does not want to be in an intimate relationship at present, can not offer me any hope for the future or work toward a mutual goal.It has been a worthwhile learning over the past 10 months on many levels. The big learning for me is about trust in myself: not to leave my heart when someone I love is not present or emotionally available.  I entered into the friendship knowing there was no promise of anything more than a friendship, but my feelings of love have not changed. It became clear that if I want to be fully embraced in a relationship, I have to move on. J. is not available for a healed partnership beyond our dating platonic friendship. I can not be sustained or fully nourished in a limited relationship, nor can I move on while I still love him. (I have often received Hexagrams 38 (Opposition) and 39 [Difficulties,Obstruction, Hinderances] and 60 [Limitation] and 12 [Standstill] as I have sought to understand him and our relationship, as well as many encouraging responses about our relationship using the oracle.) Many friends thought we were ""back together"" because we interact like a couple in public, share interests, dance like lovers, and have a level of emotional intimacy even in friendship. My close friends were aware of the imbalance and were concerned and spoke about my courage to re-engage under the conditions of the friendship.  J did not leave me for someone else but to live alone.  This is why this is so hard. He is simply choosing to live ""free"" and alone without expectations or a commitment to me. Friendship was welcome.Making the clear but difficult cut to end the platonic friendship due to my feelings for him and his limited reciprocity, was less devastating then when J aburptly left the partnership over two years ago,but shocking in its own way, as we have been getting along well.  My other posts have references, if any one who responds to this post wants to know more of the history of this relationship and process using I Ching.I know I can not continue or return to the platonic friendship while being true to myself and honest about my feelings for him. I realize I was at a disadvantage in the friendship, giving way and following his lead. It was okay for a while to learn more, to see what could develop and how I would feel. Now, I don't want to continue with the imbalance or be at a disadvantage. Yet, I still hope for him to see the light of the goodness in himself and the value of commited relationship. We share an incredible amount of compatibility...but there's the wall. I believe underneath is his fear of failure.  I believe my choice to end the friendship at this time is the right action given the circumstances, though it hurts.Using LiSe's site, I asked the I Ching today: ""Will J seek me out or is it over for good?""I received:Hexagram 64-Not Yet Across, Lines 2 and 6, changing to 16 Enthusiasm-Weaving ImagesLine 2 Dragging One's WheelsLine 6 To Be True When Drinking Liquor.

1496,"Hi,I'm on a teaching placement in China and sharing the experience with 6 others. 2 guys and 4 girls, who already seem closer to each other. This is all fine. I'm used to feeling the odd one out - often maybe I contribute to this feeling with an overly suspicious mind. But I also know people and groups and factions. I like them all, but I don't trust that there isn't something wrong - dislike behind my back. Even if there is it doesn't matter to me, I know the types of people I can get close to and trust and they say you can only have a handful of true friends, but I will be living with these people, and seeing them everyday - work and play - for the next 4 months. I don't to make any major errors as I have done in the past, or lose myself, and thus their respect, by trying to hard or doing things that make me uncomfortable out of a need to feel liked and accepted. Something it's taken me a while to grow out of. I do generally feel like a much stronger person now though, more self-sufficient and, know myself a bit more, than not long ago... I would also say that on the whole I'm definitely having fun with them! just can't shake that feeling too...I asked, why do I find it difficult to be liked and accepted in groups?11.1,2,5 > 39There is one girl here who I'm sure didn't like me when we first met. She's warming up a bit now but is still blowing hot and cold.11.1 I think could be saying don't force it. I know there's people out there I do connect with and trust to rally around me.11.2 Could this be saying I need to/will anyway because I'm a natural diplomat usually, stay in the middle? Be neutral. At present people I do connect with properly are not at hand, so I must work with them here, but not get too involved. I do socialize and enjoy their company but I don't seem to need it as much as others, and I don't feel as included as the rest. 11.5 Is about a union of high and low...39 I've heard is about being obstructed and friends not being able to or not seeing it as in their interest to help someone who is being opposed, so they don't come to your aid? Maybe some do and some don't like me in this group, I can guess who... There are a couple of them I think are genuine but another couple who blow hot and cold. But I can be Miss over-sensitive in these situations. But I can also recognise certain types...I'm not feeling too upset by this but I'd like to know what it is I do, why people dismiss me, or think it's ok to treat me as... minor. I'm not being Mrs self-pitying here, or even paranoid, but people do often talk to me sometimes in a tone they wouldn't with another. I'm not sure if it's me giving and impression of neediness, weakness, weirdness, aloofness, maybe even arrogance? That makes it feel that I can never fit in with groups, not that I even particularly want to anymore, but it would be good to feel respected, and like a presence rather than side lined. Lol, I'm being melodramatic here - it isn't that bad - but you know what I mean? And to not always be so nice to everyone, or at least a push over. I think I will always be a bit of a loner and I'm finally fine with that. Maybe it's just that people can sense that?What do you see in this reading say re. the issue of fitting in - being an individual while also a full member of a group?

1497,"Hi,My husband and I split up nearly 12 months ago. Within weeks he took up with another woman and has been with her ever since, moving in with her within weeks of their meeting and divorcing me as soon as he possibly could.As soon as he took up with this woman I chose not to speak to him or see him and have had one conversation with him over the phone, which was only about one of our children and nothing else, my insistence in not talking about anything personal. I indicate no emotion towards him at all. I still have not got over the heartbreak but at the same time have not hesitated to get on with my life as best I can.However my ex-husband, which I still have difficulty saying, still continually asks about me via our teenage children.My question to the IChing was -  'why is x so interested in my life'  I received Hex 61.4>10.Absolutely no idea what this mite mean.thku for your insight.BlessingsMelissa"
1498,"I've asked twice on this forum about a man who is of great importance to me and whether/how our friendship may become a romantic relationship.  He was grieving the loss of his wife when I met him a year ago, and that shows signs of abating, and then comes back at times stronger than before.  He talks of this less and less, and yet, our connection doesn't move on as I wish it would.  I've had recommendations of a couple types based on the readings I've submitted here.  One was that he is very much interested and just needs a little more time, various ideas of him seeing this mourning period in a spiritualised way that isn't going to change any day soon, and also that I need to take the initiative and court HIM instead of the other way round. So I've tried these ideas, assuming that if he never wanted to stop mourning, he'd spend no time with me at all.  When I say nothing and just let it be I suddenly see him  everywhere, as though waiting for me to say something to him.  When I open the door even a little, he is right there and seems so appreciative that I have any concern for him.  His demeanor and body language all say he is torn about being ""stuck"" and wants to initiate something stronger.  Still though, nothing truly changes.  The possibility of a more involved relationship is like the elephant in the room he just doesn't mention.  And yet he seems hesitant to just go his way.  The other day I resolved to change my mental attitude, just try to release him entirely in my mind, let him choose what to do.  Strangely,  he found reasons to drop by and see me two days in a row.  Now I'm really confused.Tonight I asked, what can I next expect to hear from him?  And I got hexagram 25, changing lines 5 and 6, which becomes hexagram 51.  Shock?  So what is going on here, do you suppose?Last edited: Mar 12, 2010"
1499,"hi all,I am new here and to I Ching as well so i am still learning about casting and asking questions properly as well as interpreting my answers.Recently I had an issue with a person who I had thought of as a friend. It boils down to a series of otherwise silly misunderstandings.I asked Yi ""How can i resolve this issue with X?"" and received hex 13.4>37 as my answer.I interpret this as just being in the background and letting the row die down on it's own.This friend and I had gone on a date a few months ago and it didn't work out. Our friendship was a pretty new one but we had connected (at least i had thought so) and I wanted to continue this friendship.Unfortunately things have not been the same since.If anyone can help me with this I would be really appreciative Thank you!"
1500,"Regarding a relationship with someone I've known for a few years but never got really intimate with. We've both been weirdly evasive of each other for the past 2 years, still friends though. We were close for a while before that (we lived together a while), but summer plans came in the way of anything serious and nothing really happened. I saw her recently and she was very friendly and really wanted to get together sometime, but I'm still wary of getting involved at all with her again. Maybe it's just me, but I keep seeing this as either we should try to be together or not; anything 'in between' always gets overly complicated:Oracle for letting her go: Hexagram 44, with lines 2, 3, 4, 5 changing (to Hex. 23)I then asked this question, as we've had many opportunities to ""start something"" but we're both rather reserved at times and I was always a little hesitant to really share my feelings with her because I was for some reason thinking we were just different sorts of people and it would lead to something negative..-Oracle for letting her 'in': Hexagram 12, lines 2, 3, 4, 5 changing (to Hex. 18)I rarely get this many changing esp. twice in a row. I've looked at the method for reviewing the top UNchanging line, as well as the bottom unchanging in the 2nd hexagram, plus just reviewed what was given. Is it suggesting it would be better to see where things go with her rather than staying away? I do get the feeling this is something that has been building for a while and it could be better to address it in some way rather than try to avoid it entirely and hope we just go our separate ways with no second thoughts...I'm just confused on what to do here and how I really feel about this..What are your thoughts?Thanks for your time."
1501,"So, I went out on a date last week with a guy with whom I had immediate chemistry.  But it's still early days; we are supposed to meet again today, and of course we are each seeing other people, too.  I felt that on the date, we were both somewhat guarded (we each have a lot of Scorpio in our astrological charts ), and I wonder if it is possible for us to get past that.  Again, it is still early, but I feel there is significant potential here...I asked the I Ching: ""What result if I pursue this relationship?""I got 48.2.5 --> 15My interpretation is that there is great potential here for emotional intimacy (48.5) but we are not accessing that (48.2).  I have to find a way to draw on this source, and persist in trying to establish a significant emotional connection (15).What do you all think?"
1502,"Asked IC ""what more do I need to know right now in regards to my situation/life/challenges/fears/etc?""  (pretty BIG question, huh?!?   )Response:  hex 13.1.4.5 -->52Fellowship leading to stillness?  52 makes me think of the 25 unchanging I got yesterday which seems to be reminding me to just ""stay still"", let go and continue just doing the best I can?Hexagram 13 isn't one I've received often, but it sounds lovely with its ""fellowship and honesty""..."
1503,"Last night I had a long talk with my daughter.  I am very concerned and frightened for her!  She is 13 and seems to be going through some kind of depression and she's scared of the way she feels right now.  I'm very scared as well, as I worry that this is connected to my struggles for the past years and my ineffective method of dealing with them.  On the other hand, she is 13 and of course is dealing with many changes in herself and her life all on her own, so I'm praying this is more about her and the typical struggles through adolescence.  We have a great relationship and I feel so lucky she has come to me to discuss this.  Typically, I'd not connect myself at all to this experience she's having (she's her own person, of course!), but I was grabbed roughly to attention when she described how she's been feeling inside for the past few weeks and her description was exactly the way I would describe how I've been feeling for the past five years!  I know why I feel how I have/do, but we couldn't really come up with any viable ""reason"" why she would feel this way.  She just doesn't get why she's having this feelings and I can't help but wonder if it's related to her watching me struggle with this for so very longI am very scared and worried about this!!I asked the IC why she is so sad and received hex 9.4.5 to 14.  Line 4 sounds very ominous..yet seems to fit well with the feelings she's described to me(she was crying as she explained it to me even )  Line 5 seems to hold some sense of positivity I think? And 14 sounds positive.....???Please help me with insight into this situation?Question 2:  We have decided as a family to move in June to Nevada where my children's father now lives.  My daughter seems to want this, but I know she's also a little worried about this drastic change.  So I also asked the IC about us moving and received hex 58.1.3.4.6 to 57.  It seems the move is a good idea?  Your insights would be most welcome!!  As a parent, this entire situation is incredibly scary and I really want to investigate and be open to all possibilities and messages the IC is offering.BIG thanks for the time and experience the people here offer to me in trying to find my way through the past few years and now...I'm so grateful for the kindness I've felt in this community that I don't have the words to express it adequately...:bows::bows::bows:Namaste'"
1504,"Hi all!I would appreciate your ideas on this one. My life is drastically different from what I want it to be, not sure why that happened though...So I asked a somewhat naive, but truly desperate question:How can I get the life I want?got 38Any ideas? I'm lost..."
1505,"Please forgive my self-centered bombarding this forum with my many issues and questions...really having a tough time lately...With consideration to nearly every aspect of my life today and over the past five years, I'm just at a loss and really starting to lose hope and motivation to push through....  It feels that the harder I've tried, the worse things get and yet doing nothing and accepting this ""place"" feels so very wrong as well....I've always believed I am in control of my own destiny and am responsible to make the life I want and live by my beliefs.  Just at a total loss...and overwhelmingly frightened by the lack of success regardless of my many and tenacious attempts to do better, get better, BE better...and get beyond....So, in desperation and fear that grows and grows, I pleaded with the IC to give me insight into what on earth I need to do...Received hex 25 unchanging.   Again, please forgive my desperate place and multiple requests for assistance.  I just don't know what else to do or try Thank you"
1506,"Forgive my numerous posts this morning..I'm having a very contemplative time lately...and really appreciate the thoughts/insight I get in this terrific communityWithout getting too terribly detailed into the situation...I asked the IC about writing a letter to someone and received hex 1.1. --> 44That seems a pretty loud and clear ""NO""  not a good idea at all.... So, I then asked the IC, ""is there ANY thing at all I *can* (or should) do regarding this situation?  Response 49.2.4.5 --> 11This sounds overall positive about major changes leading to the ""peace"" I desperately long for.  I can see that the message could be that the only thing I can ever do about any ""situation"" really, is change myself and keep making the most positive changes to my character as I am able.  The strange thing is that I really like this reading and yet it leaves me feeling empty and powerless today, as though I have to accept that nothing can be done really, except the only thing that can ever be done....change myself! I'm frustrated with the whole:""don't like your situation? Do something about it...change yourself, change your perspective, change YOU.""  I'm a firm believer in this as a life-style and way to address life challenges in general and at the same time, I feel that the work I've done on myself over the past several years really hasn't led to anything being any different at all..  Therefore, all my hard work and attempts at doing this either aren't ""enough"" or aren't working....I don't know.........hoping for some thoughts beyond my own point of feeling powerless, somewhat useless, and very frustrated....which I'm sure are affecting the way I'm interpreting this messageThank you all so much"
1507,"Hello everyone and thanks for reading. I am in a difficult situation and I asked the IC What should I do to finish with this situation? I got hex 62 (2) changing to 32. Can you give me any ideas? I read about 62 line 2 and my interpretation is stay still but I don't know what 32 means, can you share your thoughts with  me? Thanks a lot."
1508,"Hi all,I have met someone I seemed to have an ease and stuff in common with and yes he is cute  we are sort of emailing as he is far away...I'm worried about getting carried away/over enthusiastic... I know this is pointless ego based fear that I need to stand back from but that doesn't stop you from feeling it! Observing the workings of your mind/feelings that is... which I guess is rising above it and seeing the bigger picture and remember everything is transitory (I received 39-20 when the anxiety started up).I asked the Yi for a general commentary on it:11.2,5 > 27Seems good! I think saying that I must remember he's far away but still keep up the connection, and line 5 is good and I think corresponds with line 2. Hex 27 - I do feel nourished by him as we have stuff in common etc.The last email I sent, afterwards I thought eek maybe too long/enthusiastic.. I asked Was that too much?Hex 28- Something in excess to breaking point!! Eeek. Maybe the I ching is saying that's what I need to bear in mind... not to allow myself to lean on this too heavily... not to let the waters rise else they spill as tears!? lol...Then I asked what next ? (energy/approach wise)32.2 > 9I need to return to the duties at hand I think. Makes absolute sense.Any commentary on these readings would be great or general advice. I realise now that it's true when they say there perhaps isn't 'the one' full stop - that there are a few out there who could be - tick all or most boxes that is... but it also comes down to timing and circumstance... and also I guess your headspace at the time of meeting. I feel like, besides them being the wrong person which I see now, people I've liked in the past have led me to make mistakes etc. making me I hope stronger and more sensible for the future, but in the process those people go 'poof'! I don't want to keep doing that though... :bows:"
1509,"hello,i asked yi a question about my current housing crisis. i basically made a big move and am trying to find an affordable home and a job and am struggling. i've been staying with friends but mainly with my new boyfriend but am getting paranoid about being dependent on him and about my having nowhere else to go. i really like being with him and am happy in his flat and i think he likes having me around too. i would like to stay with him until i find work, so i can relax a bit and focus on jobs and not spend all my limited savings on paying full rent not knowing when the next income will be, but i don't know if he wants this. i asked yi today what i should do to resolve this feeling of disquiet.i read the answer as encouraging me to go alone and not rely on anyone else. and that if i do this then the crisis will pass. would you agree? how do you interpret this?thanks"
1510,"OK...My son who is a gifted musician but very learning disabled received his music theory exam back as I had earlier posted .  He has a serious math disability and although registered as such things went awry and he took his exam without his accommodations and received a 45, failed!  Much of the test was writing music in difficult time signatures...I think he needs more tutoring in this area. Friday, March12 is the last day to drop this class... An I ching for dropping the class produced hexagram 57, 1ST AND 6TH divided changing to Hex 5. The Hex for keeping this class and not dropping it was Hex 15, 1st divided, changing to Hexagram 36.  I am very confused and really concerned..."
1511,"I'm wondering something....and it seems I've read posts on this before, but can't recall what they said or what the general thoughts were..so I'm posting to ask myselfI did a reading this morning, mostly looking for some thought-provoking material I suppose... I asked IC for insight into the dynamics and energies surrounding a date I went on on Friday that was very nice.  The response was 31.4 -->39.  31.4 seems to be a nice, positive line, yet it seems a bit contradicting...  Then the line transforms into 39:Obstruction...  And I wonder how a seemingly overall  positive hex, with a seemingly positive changing line then transforms into a hex which doesn't seem at all positive really?How would one interpret this?  Is the process one of which something basically positive is transforming into something possibly negative?  Or is the transformed hex something that's an underlying (already present) issue of the 1st hex and changing line?  It's confusing to me to get positive, positive, leading to negative....  And when I research my readings for insight, this often seems to be the transition in my readings...Curious and perplexed....would love to hear more on this!  I apologize if this topic has been posted on many times alreadyNamaste':bows:"
1512,"Hello Everyone. I found this wonderful site , been reading a bit, trying to learn.Would like a little help or insight to a desision am trying to make. Relationship insurities.

1513,"I am going to do an interneship at a company for workexperience.I've allready been to two company's before. And they were both content about me, but due to the economic crisis, they are not hiring people. So after working there for three months, I left.Now there is one company which said it would also take me for three months, but they are not hiring any people for the time being. So again, no chance of getting a steady job here.This is company H. It is a very big company, and close to where I live. But it is very formal.I asked 'how about working at H?""Answer: 60.4>58There is another company I have an appointment with for an interview tomorrow. I think they also are willing to offer me a place for three months. They also allready told me they are not going to hire anybody the coming time. So no chance at all for a steady job there after the three months.This is a middle big company, and very informal. The woman on the phone came on very friendly. And it is allso very close to where I live.I asked 'how about working at P?""Answer: 14.4.5.6>5 Then there is this third company. I have an appointment for an interview coming monday.They haven't said anything about hiring me after the three months of workexperience, so there is a slight chance of finding a paying job there maybe... I hope. I am going to talk about that during the interview.This is not as close to where I live as the other two comany's, but not too far away either. Maybe a 15/20 minute drive. It is related to healthcare, where initially my heart lies so much more then any of the other company's I am in contact with, or have allready worked at.I asked ""How about working at C?""Answer: 47.2.4>8I kind of have my hopes on the last company. Because I really would like to have a steady job. I hate starting at a new place again and again.But 47 doesn't sound very optimistic, allthough 8 does. When I look at these readings, I would say that company P is the most promising. But I think line 4 is telling me not to get any hope up of staying there after the three months.How do you see these answers?This will be the third place in less then a year.Whenever I start to feel comfortable at my job and know how things work around the place, I have to say goodbye again.So I asked ""Where will I find a job where they want me to stay?""Answer: 21.6>51Usually I take 21.6 as a warning that I am not listening. But I don't think I have covered my ears for anything relating to this.And I promise to take all the advise given to me by the kind people here into consideration. "
1514,"Recently started back into the whole ""dating"" thing...or at least I'm trying it...Have a date with a man who seems like a super nice person, very interesting, attractive, etc.  I'm very nervous...not sure why, but think it's mostly because dating is rather uncomfortable for me and I've not done much of it throughout my life and now I'm getting close to 40 (ohh geesh!) and it really seems almost a foreign concept of sorts to me Asked IC for both advice and insight into this date tonight.  Received Hex 35 unchanging.  This seems a positive hex under the circumstances...progress and growth of sorts..both of which I hope (and think!) apply to the potentials and possibilities here...especially as far as me just being willing to keep an open mind and try out the dating thing...  Should I have asked two separate questions?  Was hoping for advice on how to make it go well AND insight on what its potential would be....  I seem to confuse myself when I ask too many questions on the same topic, so I was trying to keep it simpleCan't really get any specific thoughts into the response in regards to the question itself though...

1515,"Oh dear.My school placement in China is in the middle of nowhere half an hour from the nearest town. We have a 10pm curfew, it is not safe to leave the grounds and nowhere to go even if we should want to, the school is disorganised and not fulfilling the contract. Also I have social worries - there's 4 girls here, already close *and hating it here too but I think adjusting as they've started teaching and maybe that has compensated, though I haven't tried teaching yet so that could clinch it for me if I'm bad! I also don't feel a connection with any of them, they're younger than me and loud types... The organisation promised it would find placements to suit your requirements but they've just chucked people anywhere. But maybe I should be stoical? I have some time after the placement to see China... if I make it through this 4 months. The area is very industrial and so smoggy - I thought that would get better on leaving Beijing but it got worse! And the dry air and pollution has given me nosebleeds and a chesty cough! Although I think that's getting better now...I asked the I ching - Can I stay here?29.1,4,5 > 54I think this answer is saying yes it's bad but I can survive *29.4 and I should just accept this compromising position...?Thanks all.Aside from this China has been great - I went to the Temple of Confucius in Beijing! Felt v calm there - very interesting trees and statues of tortoises and a cute on of the man himself. Will put up pics when I'm back for you to see here. Also went to the Great wall which was surreal - I want to go back there.I've been using the I ching here - have had a few social ups and downs due to the whole program involving a large group of us - and where there's groups there's problems for me - but I've mainly stayed numb and got along ok. Despite sensing bitching .. sheesh, I have made some good connections.But I've felt disconnected from the answers I've been getting - though not always. But at the beginning I felt as if the I ching had abandoned me in China. Maybe because when travelling it's so important to think for yourself!The food is crazy - skewered live seahorses, sugar on chips, goo on everything, stuff that looks like one thing, but tastes and feels like another. But the rice and noodle dishes have been fine. Think it was just the buffet food we had at the hotel - I never thought I'd be one of those touruists who seek western food in foreign countries!Hope you're all good and thanks in advance for any comments on my reading.Em x"

1520,"Hi All,  I know it will not make any difference but my curiosity got the best of me so I asked. This past Saturday I finished an interview for medical school. At the end of my interview with a Faculty member he made some very complimentary statements then said 'you will go to medical school' but then as I was walking out the door after he said 'maybe not here but you will go.' So then I wrote him a thank you email confirming my particular interest in the school and he wrote back.. ""It was my pleasure. Thanks for applying."" I'm not quite going crazy, it is what it is, but I can interpret both in opposite fashion. He may mean youre good but not good enough to go here or you will have other options and may not choose our school. As for the email it could be rote, polite brush-off - thank you for applying but he didnt have to respond at all plus he CC'd the exchange to the Dean. So I asked the I Ching: What is the nature of Dr. X's comments? 58.1 --> 47From LiSe it says:Harmonious exchange,   auspicious.Inner contentment, not needing anything from outside, is the base of freedom. You find your power within yourself. Making a true and good contact with others is only possible when this inner freedom exists.It seems like it might be good and I may interpret the comments positively but moving to 47 is unclear. Or is it saying simply not to worry about it?                                                                                                  Thanks very much"

There are issues such as having a special needs son who is severely bipolar and I believe needs a stable home...Divorce would rock his structures...I wonder if I should leave and try to really find someone I am more in tune to spiritually(my husband is dead set against I Ching) etc...or stay.

Today, I wanted to ask another question as to how things will develop, what I should do, etc. Instead I started with a question: ""Can I ask you about this?""What I got was Hex 2.1.4 changing to 51.Based on what I read in WikiWing, 2.1 can mean that things will soon change/the potential that is there will start to realize (whatever that may be) and 2.4 that there is no point in asking because, the future is ""hidden for the time being"" as there is an element of surprise that comes with it (51)..

Any interpretations / views on how to read this?Today I asked some questions (which i had asked on previous occasions as well)(1) ""Does S still love me?"" Answer was 17 unchanging. It means following where there is enthusiasm. S has not been replying for a long time now. I cannot see any enthusiasm. What do i make of this?Some time ago, the answer to whether S loves me was 13 > 1; and then 1 on another occasion (albeit this answer i derived on a different site) ... (2) ""Should I give up on this relationship?"" Answer was 30.1.2.4 > 18Hexagram 30 line 2 speaks of supreme good fortune. Does it mean that it is good to give up or not? 18 on the other hand speaks of fixing the spoilt parts ..(3) Following from the 2nd question, I asked ""Are you teaching me to work on this relationship?"" Answer was 17.4.5 > 24The way i see it, it says good fortune if there is sincerity. Overall, I need guidance on whether i should remain in this relationship and keep faith and hope.

Despite us both having moved on, I can't figure out why I still get these thoughts and feelings since I know it is over and moreso, it wasn't a very satisfying relationship for me!I understand the hex 4 part of this reading as basically telling me that I am being foolish and that is why I still have these thoughts, but really that is all I can understand here. The moving lines here confuse me and I am not sure how to read them pertaining to my question. I see line one saying I must ""desist"" but I am not taking any action towards this man so I don't see why that came up. I just doesn't seem to fit my question of why the thought of him keeps coming back in my mind.

I asked the IC about this threatening feeling with regards our relationship and got 9.1.3>59Line 1, 'return to the path' , feels like saying 'stop wondering off into something that's bot there, stop being paranoid, come back home'. Which is a relief, if I take it my imagination is taking me over...should stop this and go on with my life.However, Line 3 isn't very encouraging as it does imply some complications for a husban and wife, but I can't read into it clearly.Nothing to say of 59, dispersing + the fanyao of both lines 59.1 + 59.3...Any light shed on this would be very helpful.Many thanks."
1531,"Hey guys, I've been reading lots on this site and I'm really amazed at the depth of knowledge here. I can tell many in this community have a shorthand with the I Ching that I would love to take advantage of. I am an aspiring writer and I'm actually trying to make a living at it now. I am struggling continually with my output, it is never enough for me. Too many hours are wasted, I am too easily daunted by the task of trying to publish and facing rejection. So I asked""How do I write more consistently?"" and I got 1 with no moving lines. This was very fortuitous to my mind because it is about creativity and action, but all I can take from it is basically ""Force yourself to,"" and a vote of confidence. Is there more to it?"
1532,"Hi folks, I' ve been reading I Ching for a while, and even though I got confused sometimes (like everybody else, as I noticed), the messages make me rethink about different situations, which gives me a better insight; however, I really get confused this time with this ""waiting"" and ""influence"" analogy hex. 5, lines 1, 2, 4 changing to 31.Anyway, my question:  some advice/guidance on how to deal in this situation (below), since I am a bit anxiousSummary: This guy and I have known each other for a year, we occasionally meet each other, since I'm living abroad and he lives in my home country. I would like to go back when I finish my college degree, I still have a year and half, and for that reason we never talk about the future... We enjoy the time as much as we can when we are together.... I believe the best part of it is that we can be ourselves, without having to impress, or pretend... at least is how I feel...Anxiety: Because I've met a very close ""friend"" -female- of him, who wanted to show me she has been around...Can somebody help me?

1533,"Hello everyone,I asked if I was going to achieve my life goals this year (getting my fiction published) and my professional goals (becoming a better editor one day, right now I'm an assistant) this year. I drew 29.4.6 > 6. Great: ""Danger"" and ""Conflict"". How auspicious! Now I'm terrified.I always think that the I Ching is an augury, but I think it might be interpreting my internal conflict and its manifestation in my daily affairs.I love/hate my current job right now. I work part time, can barely afford to get by. I work for a tiny company, two man team. I work 18 hours per week. In recent months, I've had the opportunity to go to major book fairs, pitch a book idea of mine, create a sales presentation, talk to head honchos in the industry: all sorts of really expansive goodness! I turned down an offer for another job (one I was headhunted for) in December to stick with the company I work for now, because I loved my bosses so much and I knew that if I skipped out on them, they would be screwed without me. But, I can't really grow in my company. They give me loads of responsibility, but, they don't have enough money to offer me more hours. They don't have enough money to give me a raise or subsidize further training. I'm on just above minimum wage for a really complex, highly skilled job that is really demanding and stressful. The monster project unleashed in December; it's a complex web of confusion. The book was in a horrific state, it was going nowhere fast. Anyway, I wasn't really qualified for it, but my bosses gave me a lot of responsibility; they left me and a newly appointed project editor to sort out the mess. I was iffy about whether I could do it at first, but after lots of caution and lots of inner cultivation and lots of straight up hard work, I did it! I got all the content! I'm doing a good job getting the book to where it needs to go! But my bosses are querulous, constantly nit-picking, telling me ""I need to prioritize"", saying cutting things, getting short with me. That is totally pissing me off! I'm doing the best I can! I really am! But the sick thing about it is, that I'm getting results, the book is now almost done and it's lookin' good!I've got a job interview this coming Friday for my dream job at a dream company: a major, world-renowned publisher. And, guess what, it's part time! It will fill in those extra two days that I desperately need!What makes this even more complex is that I'm foreign. I live in Europe but I'm American. My mom really misses me (she's still in the States) and like, I feel this inner conflict because I'm going after my dreams and she's all wasting away alone at home. I'm 25 and I'm all about carpe diem right now, I want to rage it! But I also feel like I'm an evil person for going after what I want. I really think that I can make it though, I'm getting there!Compounding all of this guilt is the line of doom: the sixth changing line in hexagram 29.Bear in mind that in recent weeks my professional opportunities have flourished: I've gotten three job interviews (dream job for dream company, part time fits right into my schedule; the other for a very picky recruitment agency that specializes in publishing; the last for a writer/researcher position for another publisher), I've submitted my fiction to two literary competitions and, my recent castings related to my career have been generally really nice and supportive: hexagram 1 unchanging, 4.1.2.3 > 22 and 17 unchanging.Oh gosh I give up. What does this all mean?Thanks for listening to me "
1534,"Dear Clarity Community,For quite a number of years I have felt the burden of an unfulfilling relationship. The Yi has given me advice but I never seem to be able to act on it. Now, I asked the Yi: What should I do about my relationship (w. my husband). The answer, quite amazing, was:43 with ALL lines moving to 23Any thoughts on this will be very welcome, thank you!"
1535,"Hi,Here's the context:There is a guy I've known since college. A few years ago, he told me he was interested in me. Unfortunately, at that time, I was in a relationship. And I always saw him only as a friend. We continued to talk afterwards and, since I'm single, we decided to see each other again. We saw each other a few times, but I didn't know what I wanted from him. Plus, I had a lot in mind. So, I cancelled a lot of our dates and came back later on. It was really on and off. Because I just didn't know what I felt. But since February, I really wanted to see him. We went out and he was not the same. I kind of forgot about it until I discovered he met someone and they are now together. Since then, I'm mad at myself. I'm mad because I wanted to be with him, but it's too late. So, I talked to him, I told him I was sorry for the way I acted with him, that I didn't know what I wanted. And all he told me was that he didn't know what to say, that he didn't expected this, that he was surprised. He told me he needed to think about it. But it's been awhile and it doesn't seem like he's really thinking about it. So, I asked him: ""Do you really need to think about it or is it clear to you already? Because if it is clear, please tell me now and it will be easier."" And... I got not answer. I'm going crazy right now and needed some insights.I therefore asked:1. Is he going to decide to be with me? 47 > 472. What will be his decision about me? 28.2 > 313. How is he going to act with me? 30.2.3.5.6 > 58Now, I didn't like question 1 and that's why I decided to ask the question differently. I didn't like the ""Yes"" or ""No"" kind of answer. But after getting the second answer, I'm kind of confused. It doesn't relate to answer 1 at all. Answer 1 is negative, but not answer 2. Am I right? Any insight or advice would be really appreciated. Thank you,Lyrandra"
1536,"Well, hello all again.To those kind kind soul who helped me with my last reading on the changing lines in Hexagram 44, in attempts to help me achieve inner peace and calm, thank you. :bows:Now, for those who advised me the last time round, you'd know that I have relationship problems on top of all the problems I had weeks back. Truth is, we quarreled, talked about splitting up and were ignoring one another for 2 weeks. That's long, considering we talk to one another every day previously.So I consulted on the situation of my relationship and got Hexagram 32 unchanging. Having gone through the archives to find out what others think of Hexagram, I could only conclude that Hexagram 32 could mean:a) A heads up for a loving lasting relationshipb) An indication that the current situation is going to last for awhileOooookaaayyy...  That didn't help much coz it might just mean he still loves me tons or that we'll continue to ignore one another. But time was a really good proof, as in, we were on talking terms again a few days after this reading. He took the initiative.Now, my question: When a reading is done for a relationship, how are we suppose to know what a hexagram like 32 mean, like in my case? Or are we just suppose to let time tell?And to help myself achieve that calm and peace, I took a break for throwing coins, time after time desperately. So I stepped back, and instead, took to rumination and study of Iching. What happened was I read just hexagrams that appealed to me that particular day, mulled it over, and thought about its meaning. and I've got a question about hexagram 54.If a married couple gets hexagram 54, how does the picture of marrying maiden in an inferior position applies?Does it mean there is a 3rd party? Does it mean an unequal relationship?Whewwww, I do hope I managed to put my ideas across clearly. They seems kinda hard to put to words for me since they are kinda vague. Any thoughts appreciated!! :bows:"

However the property manager put a black mark against me. Meaning - he registered me as a 'bad' renter on the official nationwide rental thingo that is accessible to all landlords or property managers, so if I look for rentals again there will be a good chance I won't be able to get a place because of the black mark on the register.I asked the IChing  Is it worthwhile for me to fight against the property managers black mark  -    I rec'd   53.2.5>18This sort of sh** is the last thing anyone needs especially in todays economic climate.Blessings,Melissa"

1540,"Hey AllI just got out of a rough patch in a relationship with a girl (mostly due to misunderstandings), so I asked the IC ""What type of relationship should I expect to have with x?"" (I was thinking about different types of relationships such as lovers, friends, the so called friends with benefits, etc.).Now I've been reading a lot about this reading (19.2.6) but I haven't seem to be able to connect it to a particular type of relationship, it all seems to point to a growing and nurturing relationship but I haven't found a reference to the type.Could anyone please help me with this one?.Thanx!"
1541,"I started seeing this guy but we live in different states and our time together didnt really give us time to form a real relationship, but I will be back there this summer so we stayed in touch as friends with an opening for more if that developed.  In the meantime we were free to date others, no committment, just staying in touch, getting together again when I go back if we are both available.  Over the past few months he has asked my help with several issues in his life, wanting my opinion as well as I Ching readings.  He prefers me to do it because he has no familiarity with it, but he has stated many times how impressed he was with my accuracy, both in the readings and just my own intuition.  Hes really great, and I do care about him a lot, but we have this one major issue that he is always misinterpreting things I say and accusing me of being jealous, followed by ignoring me for several days.  Recently he reconnected on facebook with a girl he knew years ago who broke his heart and whom I already knew he had unresolved feelings for.  He had ignored me again for several weeks, but immediately contacted me after talking to her for my opinion.  It has been up and down for the past couple of weeks, and though I supported his need to see if anything was left with her, we still had this cycle of accusations and apologies.  I finally told him the other day that while I accepted his apology I felt that it would happen again, but he was welcome to prove me wrong.  I then didnt hear from him for four days, so I wrote a text this morning and consulted the Yi about his response before I sent it.  I received 37.6 which most of my interpretations have as commanding respect and all of them say good fortune or auspicious, nothing to indicate an unwanted response.  Yet what I got was a very angry reply accusing me again of sending all these angry texts and he was tired of the jealousy, etc and then he dumped me completely and stated he was removing me from facebook and blocking my texts.  The wierd thing is he mentioned that he didnt think he and the old girlfriend were going to rekindle their love, but they still had a deep connection and he was happy for that, and he closed by saying I was a good person and he wished me a good life.  I tried to reply explaining he had misinterpreted again and also telling him he was being unfair and accusing me of things that were completely untrue.  I have no reason to be jealous.  If nothing else I trust my own intuition and the I Ching, and the last response I got about our relationship for this summer was 14 unchanging.  I was so looking forward to the summer because I never get 14.  Maybe I was asking too far in advance, too much time for things to change.  But Im still confused about the 37.6.  I dont believe Yi gives wrong answers, just ones I misinterpret.  And I have been known to misinterpret a lot, but lately I was dead on, running about 85%, and the ones I misinterpreted I could see in hindsight where I went wrong and just documented my journal.  So what do I add about 37.6  How did I get this wrong, because Im really stumped.  Thanks in advance for your assistance and sorry this is so long.  I just cannot seem to write in a concise manner."
1542,"I had a call yesterday morning from a potential tenant, who saw my house and was asking to rent it for a lot less than I would have liked. The house has not been rented for a long time, but despite that I was not pleased with the offer. I am trying to rationalise my reaction, cause even though I will be making little money, it's better than nothing. Last night I felt like saying no altogether, but this morning I woke up and after having cleared some clutter in my head and made new resolutions, I thought I'd ask the I-ching 'What if I rented out the house for that amount?' and got 51, changing lines 3 and 5.

1545,"Glad to be able to say Hello again to All.  Really missed the forum while it was down.  I've been waiting to ask this question in relation to a relationship.  I've asked about him before, about a month ago, and those who replied thought the casting indicated it was just a matter of time before we would become more definite as a couple.Since then there has been total silence between us as I've been trying to respect a prolonged grieving process he is in and let him take the lead from here.  I should say, he's been grieving for nearly two years, and for the last year we've been friends. At times in the past year, he seems to have moved past his sorrow and wants to be closer and head toward the future together.  Other times he grieves heavier than ever and shuts the door.  I understand how this goes to some extent as I am a widow and he a widower, but time doesn't stand still and I'd like to know what to expect.  When my husband died I had three children to raise and had to get on with it and not hold them back with sadness, so maybe I handled it differently.  He has grown children and lives alone -- they are all at a distance.  So I asked IChing about his ""intentions in relation to me,"" and I got Hexagram 45, moving lines one, two, four, and five changing to 19.  Your interpretations are deeply appreciated.Last edited: Mar 3, 2010"
1546,Question: Where does my life need the most improvement?I Ching Answer: 17.1.3.5 62Anyone want to help me figure this out?
1547,"I've been emotionally hanging onto someone for a very long time and it has caused a lot of stagnation for me, caused me to hold back on a lot of things in my preoccupation and waiting. I finally feel as if something needs to happen and quite probably I just need to let him go. So I concentrated on the idea ""now is the time to let this person go"" not really forming a question or a determination, moreso putting that sentence out for discussion,The answer came back as 44.3.4.5 to 4.  To me this says that what we had was temporary and I now need to start new.More confusing for me is the reading I did next which was ""Please show me the way that the previous reading needs to manifest in my life now"".It answered 60.2.3.6 to 37. I suppose it is kind of a narrative: I missed my chance (line 2), I am hurt and I only have myself to blame (line 3); but I need to break away from the restrictions I have placed on myself because of holding on to this person and if I break away from this then I will be able to be happy again.To further elaborate, I asked before these two readings why I can't let go of this person and got 23.3.6 to 15 which to me made it seem like I was holding on because he is a superior person for me (superior meaning suitable) and that when the time is right our separation will end, but the 44>4 makes me think that I must be wrong in interpreting the 23>15 reading.To end this long train of readings, I concentrated on the feelings I am having of a desire and need for change and how I am confused and uncertain about exactly what needs to change and how and threw the coins. The answer came as 57.5.6 to 46. To me it seems that this answer is simply mirroring what I was concentrating on, line 5 being my need for change and line 6 being my uncertainty. Hexagram 46 I guess is the resulting change that will inevitably happen but gives no clues as to what kind of change it will be or how to do it.Anybody have anything to add because I would really appreciate hearing some more informed and indepth interpretations. I really need help getting out of my stagnation and confusion. Thanks."
1548,"Dear Friends,I am about to make a decisive step to address and hopefully solve a difficult personal problem. I have asked Yi about the outcome... not once or twice but multiple times.

1559,"I had a verbal agreement with my landlord that I would pay him the rent at a reduced fee because I was supposed to move into another place he was renovating. This was the only way I could have afforded to stay here and wait for the apartment he is renovating and not move elsewhere. This agreement was all his idea and I let him know I couldn't wait unless he took the reduced rent (all his idea). We also had another agreement in relation to this new lease. He now has backed out of both agreements and wants me to pay 140 more a month and it looks like I will not be moving into the new place at all so I am back to looking for a new apartment.  But I am concerned about what is the right thing for me to do in regards to this? Pay him the new rate or not? and move asap or not?I asked what is the right thing for me to do in regards to this situation?quoting from the archives (I think it's Topol or Dobro or one of the regulars, sorry I didn't copy it)35.1 ""talks about the frustration of 'two steps forward, one step back' and not nabbing what you're hoping for (maybe that's a part of how you feel now), but overall the line says that carrying out what you think is right is fortunate.""from Dobro:35.1 talks about being driven back as soon as you start making progress in this situation. But it's not a bad thing, cuz if you stick to what you think is right, you're fortunate. You don't capture abundance, but you're free of fault.Others say this line says don't be roused to anger and remain cheerful. so I guess the counsel is to pay him the new rate. I really don't know what is right here, it doesn't seem fair to me but paying him more would not be capturing abundance.I also want to move as soon as possible away from this guy but is there a keeping still aspect to this line? That has me confused."

1563,"I would love to hear your comments on nr. 40.6 /64. Last seven years have been a struggle with money and security for me. Everytime i tried to do something good for our bussiness, in the end it turned into something unexpected to happen that let me feel once again feared about my securuty (having enough money to our company to survive). So al these years i knew i had to feel those feelings just to learn from them. Last few months, how difficult life may look like now financially i no longer feel frightened. Near about a year ago i started up something new to make our life financially brighter, and i know i'm ready to let this work any day, any time sooner then soon. I feel very prosperous and look forward with joy for the time to come, no matter what.So yesterday i draw 40.6/64 and i feel very happy with it. To me it seems my plan is about to happen/take form. What i would love to know is how you interprete the falcon that has to be shot. Its clear that is will be shot. But is it the killing of the falcon or is it beiing one single pointedness like Arjuna for instance that i have to let it happen. Is there still work to be done (64 says to me ..give it all till you finally have reached the other shore). Remember that the falcon is also be seen in the Tarot, as Pentacles 9, often refering to material prosperity. So i would love to hear your comments on this!ThxRamayogi"
1564,"Hello, I am looking for some opinions on a few readings I just cast on an old romance that has recently come back into my life (an old reading I had done about him was just pulled up in the forums recently) Although I had intended to act indifferent to him and ""not go there"" a few glasses of wine one night changed all that. In a nutshell I, very sloppily, declared my everlasting love fo him I won't see him again for another 2 weeks I believe but I feel like I ruined something that maybe could have worked if I let it grow on it's on. Anyways I asked a couple questions about it:Did I ruin things by saying what I said? 48.1.3.4.6--->10the lines seem to be contradictory, the first two suggest that yes, I ruined things or he just isn't bothered or effected by it. Line 4 seems to suggest what I said was beneficial to repairing what we used to have. Line 6 maybe illustrating that my feelings haven't changed, I am dependably in love with him?For additional Insight I asked what effect what I said will have on our relationship in general?  42.2.4---->10this reading seems to suggest no harm done and actually it may be beneficial. I find it interesting both readings changed to hex 10! although line 4 concerns me because it talks about following the middle path, which I clearly did not do in this case. Would this by advise to handle the situation now?and lastly, Should I just give up this dream of mine to rekindle our love and get back together? 45.1.2.5----->54The lines here seem to tell me to hold on to this dream, that it could happen, line 2 especially. Line 1 definately describes me right now, line 5 would probably be him (not sincerely involved). But if he isn't ""sincerely involved"" why should I continue to hold on to this dream? and when 54 pops up I am always worried, it never bodes well in my experience. Any help applying to this reading in particular would be most appreciated as I am really at a loss what to do now and don't want to delude myself any longer if that is in fact what I am doing..."
1565,"Hey. New to the site so I am welcoming any pointers..I use the Richard Wilhelm translation, and use yarrow stalks.( been really happy with it - I thank both the book and the yarrow after every reading :bows: )my Question was:Should I eat sushi?-I recently became a vegetarian. I did this for many reasons, but mainly the idea of us humans no longer running just off of instincts and now we have quite a lot of brain power to decide and think about what we eat. ... and I watched this lobster go in boiling water.. that is what sparked a light. ANYWAYS...-I slipped and ate some sushi with a friend. I told myself that maybe I would JUST eat sushi and that is it.. no other meat.my Answer was:50 (with nine in the 4th place) changing to 18I am having a hard time stepping back and figuring what this means...I would like some help but only from people that can step out of their opinion of vegetarianism.

1566,"Hello there.  As a widow I am in the process of putting two children through university which accumulates quite a bill in short order.  I don't want them to start life in a deficit position and want to pay off the debt as soon as I can, but it's daunting.  Until it is paid, it will strongly affect my own standard of living, assuming my children will be getting employment and be on their own in several years.  My only asset is our former home which is for sale in another country and will produce some benefit when it does sell, but not nearly enough to buy a house where we are now. So I'm in the tenuous position of renting once again, apparently permanently: a big step backwards.  When the house sells, I've got still another enormous moving job to handle at significant expense, just to come out of the whole exercise with less than I paid, which is depressing.  Some days it is all too overwhelming to even think about, and it appears I am drifting into a pit financially.  In other words, I'm trying to see a way out of this position, and there seems to be no hope at times.  I will spend years paying off debt based on income from the job I've got and widow's benefits.  So I asked the IChing, how do I resolve these financial issues and regain our security?  The answer:  57, moving lines 1,2,3,4, becoming hexagram 25.I'm thinking this means my assumptions are correct and I'll be at this task indefinitely, with no security in sight any time soon.  But I can't find the equivalent reading in the archives here.  Any thoughts?"
1567,"I am wondering if someone I was in a relationship with will ever contact me again.   It's been over a year.  Both lines deal with hunting and killing and arrows.  Not sure how that applies.  I think I'll dig out my ""Lover's I Ching"" by Tarcher.  :bows:"
1568,"Briefly, my boyfriend and I had a spat today over something he said that I thought was mean and hurtful.  He reacts with the typical 'you're just being sensitive'.  The conversation ended badly and now I am just confused and still quite angry with him about what happened.  I wanted to be very cautious in how I handle the expected aftermath of this as this is our first big argument.  I consulted the iching and asked - what should I do about K?  It gave me hex 52 with lines 1, 5, and 6 changing into hex 63.  I felt immediately that this was telling me to do nothing, don't bring up the matter with him again and wait for him to call me before I decide anything.  I feel that hex 63 means that this whole issue will blow over between us, or is already a nonissue with him.  I would like to see if anyone would glance over my reading quickly and give their thoughts.  Thanks so much."
1569,"Hello everybody,I consulted the I Ching with a burning question:""Does he love me?""I had a very deep connection with this man, but this past weeks he's been acting aloof.... Well I got Hexagram 46 and turns into 32.I'm not sure how to interpret that, i'm confused. Any help??"
1570,"hey all,Recently I found out about an organization/company and I am considering of joining them. So I asked the iching:1. What are the prospects if I would join this organization? 7.2>2Ive searched alot about this and basically what it says to me is that it will require discipline(*hex 7) and through discipline they will accept me.2. I this organization able to help me with my situation? 9.4>1This says to me that they can help me but i need show my abilities first,  and that i will be rewarded later on.What do you guys think?"

1572,"For many years I was involved with a certain group here in NYC. (This is a different nonprofit organization than the one I mentioned in an earlier thread.) I am wondering if I should get re-involved with this group, now that the national leadership has changed hands. I really have a burning need for some kind of affiliation, because I literally see nobody at all on a weekly or monthly basis.I asked:'Is the 'new R' my group?' The answer was 8.2.6 > 59.I see so many different interpretations of that top line moving in hexagram 8. Seems like it can mean a lot of different things?W/B says: ""If we have missed the right moment for union and go on hesitating to give complete and full devotion, we shall regret the error when it is too late.""Other interpretations say that 8.6 means there is ""no leadership,"" which in this case is also true. But despite the lack of national and even local leadership, these groups do continue to go on. In fact, I would hate to see them die out, because I feel they are extremely valuable in the life of the community. In the perception of other members, I am the person holding these groups together. That's very draining, as I don't have much if any tangible help from other people with the burdens of this. Sometimes I get mad that that's the way it is. It's a secular group and what I can say is limited by that.Any help at all would be very much appreciated."
1573,"There's a long, old-as-time back story but basically, I accepted an invitation to dinner from a gentleman I know & am having second thoughts. He refuses to make any sort of commitment to me because he ""can't"" (a position he reiterated just this past Friday, as he intermittently does) but this week it's my birthday, and of course I'd like to be taken out.I said ""yes"" but then questioned my own judgment, so inquired whether there would be error/mistake in following through. 54.6 especially makes this one of those writing-on-the-wall readings, I'm afraid, but please let me know if anyone thinks I'm wrong in thinking I should cancel.He has been a major disappointment, but we are always so pleasant together it's hard to say no."
1574,"Howdy,I was wondering if anyone could offer me some help with a general interpretation of the 6 on the first line of hexagram 31.Various sources give various comments regarding it, without really explaining why or how they came to those ideas.The metaphor of the body (used across the lines) was perhaps more meaningful in Chinese culture, but seems ambiguous to me.""Influence begins in the big toe""Could be stretched into meaning almost anything without knowing the proper context of the imagery.What is the significance of a big toe in ancient chinese?"

1579,"Hello all,A very happy, prosperous Tiger new year to all who celebrate the Chinese New Year according to the lunar calender.The new year didn't start off right at all for me. As posted in another thread, I still haven't found a job after 6months, love life isn't going too fabulously and in fact teetering on the brink of breakdown, and then just on the 2nd day of the new year, came down with stomach flu. And I am still wincing from stomach cramps as I type. So right, when everyone is greeting everyone else happy new year, my new year apparently is not as happy as I hope for it to be.In the midst of all these negativity, I did a reading with the question ""What should I do to feel peaceful and calm now?"" Well, the rationale was in hope that I can do something to feel better about my dismal job search, my abysmal love life and convince myself that the rest of the year won't suck even if I'm terribly sick right at the very beginning. (Thought to myself ""This is not a bad omen, this is not a bad omen..."")I won't say I'm an expert like many of the senior member like Trojan and  and Lise, just to name a few here. But I reckon I've manage to improve my reading skills a little over the years and am able to interpret most of the hexagrams Iching gives me. But this... Damn, on top of having a bad start to a new year, I get a hexgram I totally don't get. I really need help.So ""What should I do to feel peaceful and calm now?""Hexagram 44.2.4.6 to 39Fish??

1580,"RE: Will I get the job?Hi all!Would really appreciate some help here since I cannot seem to understand what the Iching is trying to ask me.Went for an interview last Friday. It's a big company, and a company I would die to work for because I firmly believe in working for a company that is socially responsible and that the work I do helps some one.And to cap it all off, I have been out of work for the last 6 months, so well, I would dearly love to have a job soon to pay the bills.So after the interview, I asked:Will I get the job with XXX company?16.6 to 35Six at the top means:Deluded enthusiasm.But if after completion one changes, There is no blame.Erm, right. Deluded enthusiasm... Is Iching trying to tell my that I've been too hopeful about my chances with XXX company? Then the line about how if ""after completion, one changes, there is no blame"". How does the ""after completion"" applies to this situation? I'm afraid I'm too obtuse to see what that means.Help please?"

I am not going to bore you with all the details, but suffice to say that she was acting the opposite of what she was saying both verbally and non verbally previously and showing all the signs of being interested.After a couple of days reflection, I sought guidance and received 22.2.5->9 I have tried to gain an insight into the situation, but am struggling with the images and lines. To me it is saying ""image is important at the moment"" but the lines seem to be pointing to ""tending to the inner image rather than just the appearance"" in line 2 and in line 5 it is pointing to being oneself rather than being influenced by vanity?I am not sure this makes sense or whether my interpretation is way off the mark.

I am really at a loss here, cannot even offer an explanation first...I am startled...I feel I understand that it is a hexagram that has to do with nourishment so could that mean that if I abstain from sex for the first few dates, I will provide X with spiritual nourishment instead?

Also, got it twice...29 is about a danger of sorts but again, I cannot put it in context here...I would appreciate your opinion(s)...Bea "
1585,"Hello, I have a pretty clear idea of what the iching is telling me, but I would like a second and third opinion..I used the Iching last week to interpert a certain day-to-day event that I witnessed during a powerful meditation (vision quest, but that's beside the point). I asked the question not with words, rather I focused on the event and asked to learn what its significance was.The answer 58.2.5 changing to 51.I interperted this as telling me that I need to gather myself into my center and watch out for negative influence from people around. I wrote to myself that the Iching is talking about the idea that I've been considering for a while, of moving away from the city in which I live with many friends to a quieter place, where I can focus on my studies for two courses that I am taking, and spend more time in the wild, which is what one of those courses deals with mainly. The second and fifth lines seem to be addressing exactly this: distancing yourself from elements that might get in your way and weaken you, knowing to place boundries, and indeed one of the things I find very hard about living where  I do today is the difficulty of putting aside enough time for focusing on what's imortant to me (because it requires serious daily work), it is hard because of all my friends which I love who are always around, unkowingly distracting me and I end up feeling my time is not fully used.Today I asked the Iching specifically if I should move out of this city and again I got the same answer exactly - 58.2.5 changing to 51. I guess the message is pretty strong. I don't know if I want to leave though, maybe I can stay where I am and still do my work, it is possible but requires a great feat of will. I feel that hex 58 in this context means not joy but more like hedonism, there is much fun in the city for me but not enough fulfillment. I am not sure whether to interpert hex 51 as refering to staying where I am and overcoming the difficulty regardless, or ""Six in the second place means:Shock comes brining danger.A hundred thousand timesYou lose your treasuresAnd must climb the nine hills.Do not go in pursuit of them.After seven days you will get them back again.""can mean that I need to retreat to a high summit and be more alone in these times.Thank you for reading, I would like to hear your thoughts.Yaniv"

1587,"Hello again I was hoping to get some help deciphering these answers from the IC regarding a short film script I wrote 3 years ago which I'm now thinking of resurrecting and actually making into a short film....I asked the IC...""Will the script in it's current form be received well by viewers and critics?"" I got Hex 51 unchanging, which I know means a shock or suprise of some sort or even a 'rousing up' as in invigorating life into something...but I couldn't quite work out if it was a good sign or a bad sign i.e. that it would offend people (there's a cultural component to it and cultural themes are always open to misinterpretation and offence), or that people would generally be excited by it (I am, and it's a fairly contemporary theme with an avant garde approach to the cultural changes within Australian society)I then asked ""Should I proceed with this script/idea?""I got 56.3>35 which talks about arrogance and being a stranger in a strange land, but then goes onto 35 which is about progress....is this just a warning how NOT to proceed? especially that I've been out of the game for a few years now and would be a little rusty directing crew and getting crew support etc?? Or could it be about the cultural element again i.e. aside from Australian culture, the other culture featured is not my own background/culture so people could see it as me stepping in where I don't belong?I then asked ""Should I proceed with making this film?""I got 64.1.4.5>61 which I took to mean not just yet or don't put the horse before the cart (line 1) but that yes I should push forward and ignore any misgivings even though it might be a struggle (line 4) and that it will come together and there will be a reward, as in a new era will dawn (my creative era) (line 5). Line 61 seems to reinforce the advice of inner confidence and following my inner gut feeling to push through with this passion of mine...I then asked ""What do I need to do to the script to fix it or should I just leave it the way it is?"" I got 18.3.4>64 which confused me because I know 18 to be about fixing corruption from the past. Does this mean it does need fixing? If so, how do I know where/what the corruption is??Any help interpreting these lines is very much appreciated :bows:namasteSofia"

I just wanted some insight about my interpretation that I was in danger.  I can't sleep at night."
1598,"Hello all,Just wondering what you'd say the advice was in the following readings. There is a possibility of going travelling with a friend after my teaching placement for about a month in China, but it's just a potential at the moment. I asked the I ching to comment generally about this idea5.3 > 60I think this says I should not be vulnerable and be well prepared, but also perhaps not stuck in the mud? Not to bring negative expecatations to it? Also, that I need to be aware of the limitations such as financial issues.I then asked should I minimize commitment?hex 18 something's spoiled perhaps in my thinking, i.e over thinking of this or that there's something in the relationship which could decay and thus I shouldn't be too commital?We have not known each other that long but did get on really well when we were together.I then asked simply, should I be open to anything, including a month of backpacking with her and potential others?It does sound amazing, but I don't trust myself 33.2,3,4> 18I think this is saying I need to withdraw,  either from giving this potential experience negative over-thinking, or from commiting as it would not be for a while and anything could happen until then?As these answers had seemed negative I asked what are the potential problems in travelling?Hex 15Maybe that I need to downplay the issue for now, and not get carried away. Remain aware of my ignorance in the situation at the mo. But also be open to new learning experiences. And I think doing what the moment calls for?Finally I asked how to overcome the Hex 18 present in this idea?4.2,3,6 > 15So, I guess a clear re-teration that I should be open but aware of my youth and inexperience. Remember I'm a student of life, keep learning, and take it one step at a time.Would you agree? what do you think is the main message of re-curring hex 18 and 15 with regards to backpacking?I know I'm probably worrying over nothing, and I'm sure she's not expecting a straight yes or no. It's just annoying that I'm not more relaxed and think - hey what an experience and good opportunity that would be! Rather I worry about how we'd get on and my ability to adapt and enjoy it. :bows:Last edited: Feb 16, 2010"
1599,"Hello all, A follow-up to my last post several weeks back. The man in question and I spent more time together and are more on the same page. However, there are several problems. First is his hesitation about intimacy based, according to him, on health issues. His health is very poor now and he's on some serious medication, is being treated for anxiety attacks, and other serious physical issues. These are short term and resolvable, not mortally threatening. And though the health problems are real, I cannot help think that they're either due to me or a reason for him to pull back from me somehow. He seems to be doing so, saying one thing, doing another. I dont know to what extent it is fear, or health, and how I should act. So I've asked the Yi a few questions. Show me a picture of him now: 48.4 (and forgot the last hex, but i believe it was Preponderance of the Great).How can I best help him: 2.4 and 16. I take this to mean keep a low profile but be enthusiastic if he phones me. If you see it differently, please share.Can I hope for Romance with him? 49.2 and 17Should I address him only as a friend? 55.1 and 62.If I flirt with him? Hex 17.2.4 and hex 60 Limitation.So then, if i do this, am receptive and do not openly flirt, what is the best possible outcome? 43.2 and 49I am curious what this 43.2>49 means. Especially 49. Is the molting revolution a change *within* our dynamic to something better, or signifying a breakage of whatever we have now, to a departure of ways??Line: 2:  A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night. Fear nothing.The Superior Man is always on his guard and so, when there is an alarm, he does not become excited and flustered. When reason triumphs over fear, he treats difficulties as though they did not exist. As he develops his strength of character, so others submit to him without argument.That phrase ""when reason triumphs over fear"" certainly would be nice, but can it be taken literally ?? And hex 49. Ko / Revolution (Molting)Revolution. On your own day You are believed. Supreme success. Furthering through perseverance. Remorse disappears. The Image Fire in the lake: the image of Revolution. Thus the superior man Sets the calendar in order.And what does the ""Calendar"" mean here?"
1600,"I asked if I would hear from a Guy I had feelings for -for many years now.  I got Hexagram 1 unchanging.  It's been a long time since I have heard from this individual and I have pretty much let go of my feelings that we would be together.  These feelings are still present, but I don't act on them.  I don't contact him.  I have had a hard time deciding what it meant."

1608,"Hello,I'm new to this site, but have been practicing I Ching for over a decade now. If you would be so kind, I'd love it if you guys could help me with my most recent divinations?I am desperately seeking another part time job. I've already got a great job as an Assistant Editor, that I love, and that has lots of potential opportunities, but it keeps me stationed in the poor house, because I work for a tiny company and my bosses simply can't afford to pay me more. I pitched a book at a major book fair, sent it to publishers and am waiting for their decision as to whether or not they'll publish it, I'd be the writer and it would catapult my career (all of this has transpired due to the opportunities at my current job), but in the meantime, I need an additional source of income to fund my dreams (I'm a writer and I'd like to enter fiction competitions, take more courses to improve my skills, etc.). I've been actively applying for jobs, writing, revising and submitting my fiction on my personal time, but, although I'm getting leads, nothing substantial and permanent has come to fruition yet.I interviewed for another part time position last Thursday. At the end of the interview, the people I met with said they'd ""hope to"" be in contact with the successful candidate on Friday (day after the interview). I have not heard anything from them yet, not a rejection email or a phone call.After waiting by the phone, freaking out, but not receiving a phone call last Friday, I consulted the I ching, asking specifically whether or not I got the job, and I received a static hexagram 19 Promotion. I am waiting by the phone freaking out today and I consulted the I ching again asking whether or not I'll proceed professionally, or if all of my dreams are delusional. I received hexagram 60.2-->3. (I received this exact divination nearly two years ago when I was in a similar situation, and I found a temporary dream job [writing reviews] two days later).I called today to follow-up on the job I interviewed for, and both people that I interviewed with are out of the office (the lady until Wednesday and the man is out of the office the whole week) and receptionist that I spoke with doesn't know whether the role has been filled or not, although she says she ""thinks it has""! Also,as I was writing this post, a man from a temp agency called me and I just scheduled an interview with him for tomorrow in the AM about a role.(Before all of this, last week, while I was experiencing a temporary bout of complete mental frenzy, I got static hexagram 49 Changing/Revolution twice)What is going on?!"

1610,"Asking whether a new romantic interest is feeling as positive about things as I am, and would be in touch again [it is a fairly complex situation], I got the reply 16.4 turning to 2.  The ideas of harmony in 16 sound so encouraging in general. And also the Duke of Chou reading of the fourth line ""great is the success which he obtain, his aims take effect on a grand scale.""  I'm wondering whether the aims taking effect on a grand scale are his, or mine or both if we are ringing in harmony here?  Am I right to assume this reading is so positive?"
1611,"I asked the I Ching the question ""Who am I?"". After 3 or so months of depression, inertia and isolation I now realize, with the help of a few friends, that the next step forward is to establish an identity for myself. I cast hexagram 18 with changing lines 2 and 6 into hexagram 15.Here's some background.Physical and emotional neglect during led me to try and escape bad memories and a sense of worthlessness by moving abroad and start afresh, but I ended up almost immediately in an abusive relationship lasting 5 years, repeating the same patterns of childhood and some worse, sexual abuse from a doctor from whom I sought help, followed by 7 years of isolation, working mostly from home with a few social contacts and activities, and one-to-one talking therapy during which I became more and more dependent on the therapist and didn't really get over my depression and even began overeating.In the last 2-3 years I have been part of an organization which is a source of therapy for damaged people and their families and then helps them in practical ways to identify their skills and resources with the aim of functioning preventively within society and ultimately changing it.After a brief period of the therapy stage I moved city, leapt into the skills stage and had a positivve long run of self-esteem, helping others and using my skills.The organisation is now planning an important expansion project and is asking for a deeper commitment from those willing and able and I, in theory, could be one of these.A few months ago I went through a series of strong emotional challenges and disappointments which I didn't have time / wasn't able to deal with and this led to my relapse into depression.My friends in the organisation are saying that I am negative, chronically indecisive, that I should make make a break with the past, make a decision to move forward in my life and decide what I want to do with it.Now my question/confusion is whether to go with this ideological and worthy project, even though I see it as overwhelming and larger than (my) life at the moment, or to continue working with them on a low-key basis, rebuild my career, continue to work on my emotional issues and hopefully find love (I haven't been in a relationship since the abuse).Thanks for giving me another point of view.Altrum"
1612,"I have had a returning stomach problem for years, doctors dont know what it is, maybe an allergic reaction. Anyhow, I tried to ask I Ching:  What can I do about my stomach problem and it said: 3.5 > 24.Cant make sense of it. In one of my translations it says: Sprouting: your juice. The small opens the way. The great closes the way.  I can see its something about not overdo something, but what? How or what should I ""sprout""?

1617,"Hi thanks for reading - I have looked on hexagram searches for understanding and couldn't find an exact correspondence. Basically, I have a relationship which is done - we are out of touch. I'm almost there, but always wonder what they think, and I'm attempting to further clarify and understand what may be their truth, so it can help me let go. I did so by asking about myself, and clarified my stance, but am stuck on what may be his perspective - So I asked.Where does he stand in position to this relationship- 49. I was confused I asked to clarify this and received: 31.1.4- 63. Here is what I get: a complete turnaround, an overturning of a previous attraction, now concluded. Do you see something I don't? Or can you confirm - thank you."
1618,"In response to a question re potential of a relationship, I got hex 2, all lines changing except line 2.I've read that in such cases only the not changing line should be taken into account, BUT I've also read, other sources, that only the non moving line should be considered but in the relating hex (in this case, then, 13.2). And yet other sources suggest that all the lines are, normally, read and the non moving line disregarded.Which one should I do?Thank you in advance not only because this is an important question, but because I never really know how to deal with multiple changing lines.:bows:"

1620,"Hello again, after my rather protracted thread at Christmas I decided to take a step back and start looking at myself and the way I react to situations and events. I have been trying to take in more of the texts of the YiJing but am progressing slowly, which is good I think and have found a bit more of a level or balance. I am far from being knowledgeable and still feel that I struggle everyday to find the guidance in the teachings. I have also taken a step back from scatter gun asking questions and focused on the first one when cast. I also realised that I was asking questions that were not about my path but someone others. Having kept a record of the questions previously asked I can see a picture built up that all really point to the original hexagram or maybe a subsidiary questions hex.Having read more both here and other places I can see the need for calmness and connectedness when questioning and to then leave the answer if it is not self apparent evident at first. I have also started to try and record not just the question but also moods and emotions at that time too. I feel that after the initially joining the site I was deaf to the kindly people here and only want to hear the positive outcome I had built in my mind. Now a couple of months on I see that there is a mountain to climb to reach the lake, but a journey has started!... and for the record the situation from my last divining never materialised, as suggested so the answers were in the 'ching' but I chose not to heed them. Once again thanks to those who gave council I have now moved to a more 'what am I doing/what do I need to do' approach. Hopefully in time I can be able to read the signs more competently and steer a slightly smoother path! :bows:RegardsTom"
1621,62.3 doesn't seem good. Does X think about me romantically? Because I do all day. What steps should I take now?
1622,"Although I do not usually recall very much (or anything at all) from my dreams, this past saturday/sunday (feb. 6/7) I dreamed I was reading some material about the i ching to a small group of people. The hexagram being discussed was number 11 and the text I was reading referred to it as Making Peace. The moving lines were nine in the second place and six in the fourth place. There was some information that I was just starting to read when I awoke. It is not clear to me if it was an alternative text for the hexagram or some additional commentary. What ever it was, I was not able to bring it with me into the waking world. There is only one time that I can recall when I actually retrieved dreamtext. That was many years ago. It was a new verse to a song.Has anyone else experienced i ching consultations in dreams or retrieved i ching related dreamtext?"
1623,"Some months ago (two or three, I do not remember well - sorry, it seems an year ago to me) I posted something about my situation at the University. You were all very encouraging, and you suggested that it was advisable to me to apply for a certain position. It is exactly what I did (it does not need to tell through which very rocambolesque steps...). Anyhow, you were right in saying I would have been asked to apply, for I was (actually I was really obliged to apply!); but unfortunately I, on my side, was right in saying that I could not be the main candidate, for it was so. The decision is not taken yet; but, at the present moment, is is very probable that such position goes to someone else than me.Unfortunately again, this is not the main problem. The truly tragic point is that my professor, after giving to me the bad news about the position, said that, being my situation very difficult, I had to decide whether I wanted to stay at the University (with no certainty), or to leave forever. Such aut-aut was a first cold shower. I had the second one last Friday, when, after a couple of day of desperation, I have told him I wanted to stay anyhow: he watched me very surprised and remarked how it was strange to him that I wanted to stay ""after such offence"" (i.e. after they let me know that I will not have the job). I took this as he tried to hint very politely that he wanted to get rid of me.I asked the I ching about my situation for three times. The question was always the same: what will happen to me (with reference to the University)? Unfortunately I have not the first two answers with me, but I know they were favourable (I will post them later, when I find them). This surprised me a lot. Now an hour ago I asked the same question and the answer was: hex 12, changing lines 4 and 6 - hex 8.This seems again to be a very favourable answer. To me it says that the many years I spent without results are about to end, and I am about to move in a much more pleasant situation. Am I wrong? Is there a more suitable question I have to ask? Thank you very much indeed."
1624,"I placed a question yesterday about the steadiness of my income during 2010, and  I got Exagram  22. I still cannot pierce the core of this answer though I have checked it up in Stephen Karcher, Jack Balkin and master Ni Hua Ching. I find the answers very much addressing the inner values improvement. At the end I dont know if I Ching is asking to be a better person when I was expecting something about the flow or interruption of my income. What do you think ?"
1625,"Hi,Recently I signed an agreement with my friend that myself and my son cld live in her lovely holiday home in a caravan park for 6 months. However, it still has to be approved by higher authorities.We have been waiting on their answer for about 2 weeks and have contacted them several times but still received no answer.My friend has now gone overseas and asked me to keep in contact with the authorities, but my request for an answer has still not been forthcoming.I am becoming desperate as we now have to leave my present accomodation within 2 weeks and have no where else to go.My question to the Yi was -What do I need to know about the agreement between my friend and II recd hex 50.1>14.I am now fearful as it says to me the agreement will be upturned, hopefully I am wrong.

1626,"I am ready to move on from my current job and there is a position that I am interested in applying for but am also unsure about whether I can handle it or if its a better position/employer than the one I have now. I asked the I Ching ""Would this new position be better for me than the one I have now?"" I got 9.1.3.4.5 to 64. I'm a little stuck on this answer. It seems positive but I guess I am confused about what the positive aspects are referring to and how the line about the husband and wife fits in. Cheers."

He's naturally quite outspoken and very values driven so this fits with him personality wise.

Ironically, the very next day after meeting him to thank him for his integrity and help about another issue, and through sheer (luck?) I found out about the thing he had done!He then disappeared, instead of apologizing, which really surprised me considering we’re both at a mature enough age. In fact, he’s 10 years older than me. The decent thing would have been for him to address the issue, because he knows I know what he did.It’s been a few weeks now and still no word from him. Today, I asked, what will happen to this connection?And received, 56.1.3.6 moving to 51. How would you interpret this? Thank you."

1631,"Hi all,Yesterday he told me that his has a very serious health problem. I was shocked by the news and didn’t ask a lot of details, will discuss it though the coming days. What I know is that some doctors proposed immediate surgery but they can’t promise that will solve the problem or more important if it cause other problems because of the nature of the problem. Some others proposed medicine for the time being because of the great risk of the surgery. The only question I could ask Yi was “what I need to know about his situation”, as a starting point to think and do what needs to be done from my side. I’m shocked and numbness has frozen me. The answer I got was 15.4.5 > 31.I wonder what you see in that reading. I ‘ld appreciate anything you can offer. Thanks in advance,Maria"

1634,"I consulted the iching recently about when I can expect something to happen - not a relationship question - just for a general timeline. Wilhelm says about this line - Comfortable approachNothing that will further.Things are going well for a man: he achieves power and influence. But in this lies the danger that he may relax, and confident of his position, allow the easygoing, careless mood to show itself in his dealings with other people. This would inevitably be harmful. But there is possibility of a change of mood. If he regrets his mistaken attitude and feels the responsibility of an influential position, he frees himself of faults.I feel that the iching - as always - wasn't really answering my question the way I'd asked but instead was telling me that I'm too relaxed in my actions perhaps and that there are still things left for me to complete in this matter.  I was just wondering what your own real life experiences have been when you've received this line.  Thank you. "
1635,"I've been thinking about selling my house and moving back into an apartment. The house is really stretching my limits as I'm having a lot of trouble keeping up and making it from pay check to pay check. I could try and sell the place and move back into an apartment that would be much easier for me to afford, but bad economy = crappy time to try and sell house... Anyway, I asked ""How will selling my house and moving back into an apartment impact my life?"" The answer was 52.3 > 23So now I'm wondering if I should have phrased the question differently... 52 is keeping still, but I'm not sure what it's referring to... that selling would allow me to keep still... or dont sell it and just stay where I am(52). Because it doesn't further me to undertake anything?(23)"
1636,"Howdy.  I am a new member to this site.  I have been lurking this site for a couple of years, and everyone's insight seems very helpful.  I have usually been able to figure out what the oracle tells me on my own, but I have recently been confounded by a reading.My question: ""What should I be doing to be living a fulfilling and meaningful life?""  The oracle's response is Hex 6 with lines 4 and 5 changing to Hex 4.I know that Hex 6 is about conflict, in my case internal conflict, but I'm just not sure what to make of this.  Well, thanks in advance for any help."
1637,"We're a recently married couple (one year), lived together for two.  My wife is pregnant and due in 3 months. We've been agonizing about a decision to move or not to move by purchasing a bigger apartment. It could put some stress to our finances, our careers and our way of life.  We could stay where we are, a smaller apartment that gives us no financial worries, but is far from perfect in many ways, and a bit small with a new toddler.  We could just stay where we are and postpone the decision to move for a year or two, without the pressure of the incoming birth, and a better knowledge of our mental and financial situation then.  So we did the I Ching, asking the question if we should move, and the answer was #37, with nine at the beginning.  It was interesting to read the hexagram traditional interpretation relating to the role of each partner in a family, as the decision to move, would put extra pressure on my wife, who has a career, than me, the man who would be a stay at home Dad.  Can you help us understand what the I Ching is telling us?  Thank you"

I rely mostly on the memorizing threads to help me get a direction of what my readings mean, until sooner or later (usually sooner) it clicks with my inner vision.I am a musician, and I have some trouble composing. I can sit and play for hours if I feel like it but composing requiers a different commitment: it requiers to be creative, not overly self-critical, patient etc... I have difficulties with it, and I feel even though I can express myself very well through music composed by someone else or improvised by me (I play persian classical music which relies immensley on improvisation), I ""dry up"" when I try to compose something new.So I asked ""how can I open that creative place inside me when I come to compose music?"", the answer was 14-->1.I've only started pondering what it means but I would like to have some guidance in how to interpert the judgement.Thank you."
1639,"More on line 55.1, the first line moving in Abundance Peaked.Was reading in the Concordance that the 'princes of equal rank' can indeed be husband and wife.So why should they 'go' after a complete cycle of time? The text says ""Exceeding a decade, calamity indeed."" Calamity is said to mean the disaster comes from outside, as opposed to SHENG, when the disaster is due to personal fault. Does this mean that whenever a husband and wife are both strong people, that they will inevitably always need to move every 10 years? I asked: ""What is the reason husband+wife have to move after a complete cycle of time?""Got 10.1.2.3.4.6 > 53Only line not moving is line 5.H53 pertains to our marriage, I think, the stages it has gone through and will go through."
1640,"hi hope to have help on this interpretation:some days ago i ve received a anonomous call, and once i got the call nobody on the other side was speaking. that's typical of my ex. so i decided to ask the oracle...""was my ex  calling me that morning?""i got hexagram 16 with changing lines 1, 3 and 4 changing into hexagram 36...the darkening of the lighthow would you see this? thanks"
1641,"Hi all,i have a really severe problem. It´s about a working contract i signed ages agowhich did prohibit to work for one of this companys clients - which i accidently recently did. I was not aware they could be connected in any way as they are in different lines of business. However this might end up in court once they notice my work.I did already seek advice from a lawyer who told me that it is a 50/50%case. I might win or lose. For sure it will cost a lot of money andloosing means my financial ruin for a long, long time (paying lawyer, court etc.). :bag:The other possibility is to contact this company trying to get themto an out-of-court settlement. But i know they are not interested in money.My salary is less than peanuts for them. It`s about principles.Now i feel like the rabbit in front of the snake. If i just wait i feel constantlyunder anxious pressure. If i contact them i fear to have to go to court.I did ask the yi: what shall i do? Contact or wait and hope for the best? Answer: 48.2 -> 39Any thoughts?"
1642,"HiI really need some help!  A little history.  2 months ago, I stated dating a man that I have known for 2 years.  We were both in a group of people that got together during Monday night football.  We always joked around and flirted but nothing outside of Monday night football. Well, one night he told me that he secretly was interested in me.. but was afraid to act on it until now.  In short... we started dating.  Since that first date.. he has called me everyday, we see each other about 3 or 4 times a week. Yes.. we are intimite. And he spends most of this time off with me.Now... recently.. he started up on facebook ( I set him up and put all of this pictures up for him).   Today.. I tempted  to go into my face book.. and his book came up !!!!!!I just found out that he has been emailing all these old girlfriends from high schoolOk.. great.But... today.. we talked about going out after his workout.  and I just saw.. that he made a date with a girl for tonight.  My questionWhat should I do about this situation with x    36/2/4/6 =14What do I need to know  ... I got 7Thank you for any insight"
1643,"Hi everyone,any help is much appreciated. Im currently seeing a therapist. It's alternative therapy. It's costing quite a lot, ske keeps saying it'll work.

1644,"Ok this is strange.  For anyone who has followed any of my post knows that me and my fiance broke up 6 mos ago.  I have my own company and we worked together for 4 yrs in which I tried to get us to a comforatable spot financially and had succsess with it. She was always hesistant to come on board fully because she always wanted to do her ""own thing"".  I had no problem with this because i felt as long as we were working toward similar goals we didnt have to work at the same location.  After the breakup she said all i wanted was $$ and theres more to life than that.  This isnt the case by the way but you know people say things when going thru a break up.  I've tried serveral times to reconcile our relationship with not much success so I gave up.  She had been trying to find a job for 3yrs while we were working together but was never able to land one.  Then 3 weeks after we broke up she finally found a job.  I had a feeling she wouldnt be there long and on monday she got fired.  Now shes on foodstamps and section 8.  I dont really know how to view this as it is such a shock to me.  We had an opportunity to really make a good life together but she wasnt able to see what i saw.  So now that shes unemployed shes calling.  I dont know what her intentions are, i know i would like to reconcille but only if she wants me and doesnt need me for $$.. So i asked the question.What type of relationship does she want with me at this point  and i got 11L1 changing to 46.I also asked does she want to get back together and i got 37L4 changing to 13.  Its really crazy how life works out.  I believe everthing happens for a reason, I hope i just dont overanyalize this to see what i want to see."
1645,"36.2,4>34     faithfulness...hi dear all...first since this is my first post here, id like to say hallo to every user of this forum, and share with you my newly started passion and respect for the iching and all the great and deep philosophy that lies under it.Since i m a beginner, i would love to share the interpretation of the oracle with who is more experienced and willing to share!i've questioned the oracle a question that was formulated like this: ""if me and her would have married, would she be having affairs behind my back?""...the oracle replied: hex 36 Darkening of the light - changing into hex34 the power of the great.what do you think?Last edited: Feb 6, 2010"
1646,"Hello everyone!This is my first question on Online Clarity. Hope you can help.The situation that makes me ask I-Ching often for guidance and clarity is a pending relationship. I like him. In a nutshell, we have been together only two times but what happened was very powerful and have changed me. I think he likes me too but one's never sure. There are issues, particularly an ex-girlfriend who doesn't go away. We (me and this guy) haven't seen each other for many weeks.What does X want from me?Got: 63.6 > 3763 (After completion). 6 in 6th: . ""After crossing a stream, a man’s head can get into the water only if he is so imprudent as to turn back. As long as he goes forward and does not look back, he escapes this danger.""I think that he doesn't want me to go back, forget what happened or leave his life. He would like me to ""go on"".Then it changed to hex. 37 - The family.Does it mean a potential stable and defined relationship? What's your opinion on the meaning of both hexagrams?Thanks!"
1647,"to get the life I want?54.1.3.6-> 50My life is drastically different from what I want, my view of things wasinfluenced by other people up until now, the life that I have is not what I want, and it's not congruent with my innate values/needs/desires.And since it''s been like that for my entire life, I fear that I can never truly realize my dreams and aspirations that were buried deep in me for such a long time.In a sense,  I wasn't  living  up until now, I was just surving hoping that thing willsomehow magically change, which they never did. And now I reached the point where I can't be surviving any longer, it' either getting the life I want or not living at all, as i can't take this suffering any longer. I fear that I'm doomed. Doomed to be aloneor not with the man I want. Doomed to be unsuccessful, unloved, unappreciated, not respected, not taken seriously...Doomed to lead a life of a failure..Your ideas are more then welcome, they can be truly life saving at this moment.Last edited: Jan 30, 2010"
1648,"A while ago (almost  2 yrs i think)  i had a NDE experience, followed by a trip in jungles of Peru, living with shamans for awhile. In that trip during one of the ceremonies I've received a gift from the spirit which I don't fully understand yet (since it came without a user manual  ).  It completely changed my life but i'm still struggling  to understand how can better use it. That's why i've turned to I Ching in the first place. So I've asked I Ching :How you better describe the gift i've received ( so I can better understand it )?I got 25.1.4.5.6 -> 2 ( Innocence - no big news since i already know that)Next question wasHow do i better make use of it ?45.4->8 ( this is easier to understand)Any insights will be appreciatedThank you"
1649,"Good afternoon ,i wonder if you can help me with the following both hexagramms i received when sending a good-bye letter to my friend/guy:Q: ""Is this letter okay as it is?""32 Duration (no changing lines)Q: ""What will happen once i sent this letter?""55.2 Abundance [Fullness] -> 34 The Power of the GreatThe background situation is the following:(sorry i am german so my english is not the best)I was with a guy (lets call him F.) who, many years back, was married to a pretty crazy woman. They have 2 girls of 10 a. 12 y. living with her. Since 9 years F.`s exwife terrorises him sometimes more sometimes lessHe called her the ""plague of the century"".F and i kept our relationship absolutely secret so exwife and kids would not become jealous. (We live in the same house but in seperate flats. So that was easy to manage.) However for me that was only a parttime solution. I asked F. many months back to set out some basic rules and regulations for his exwife, f. e. making monthly ""babysitting plans"" and directing their communication towards emailing instead of talking/phoning which often ended up in bad argueings (you do not pay enough, don´t care enough..etc.. which is all but in any way true). F agreed and eventually handed exwife a letter over saying all this... sigh... but nothing changed. F. did not stick to any of the regulations himself. In the end he told me, he shortly has to do ""babysitting"" as his exwife has to do ""important"" work - whatever this means... Friends of mine adviced me to split which i did yesterday. That was not easy for me as we did really liked and loved each other.I put a short good-bye letter into his letterbox saying: to me he is ""working"" for the wrong woman and that will not work out with me.Before i sent this letter, i asked the I ching, if this letter is okay, well written... and received 32and then i asked: what will happen once i sent this letter? receiving 55.2 -> 34To me this relationship is finished and i have no hope anymore - though i like to understand the I ching better.How would you read 55.2 Abundance [Fullness] -> 34 The Power of the Great ? And why did i receive 32? Any thoughts?"
1650,What is if you get hexagram 63 for a romantic relationship? There are no changing lines. It concerns a person you 've just met. :bows:
1651,"Hi all!Please help me out with this one...I asked this question because one psychic told me something about my hormonal shift ending when I'm 42. And she is usually right...

1652,"Hello! This is my first post on the forum and i'm also still very inexperienced with the I Ching, but I was hoping you guys could give me some insights.I don't know if you need this much background information, but I figure it may help.I still have no idea what I want to do with my life, and recently I feel that i've lost everything that was really important to me, including a relationship that I was investing so much of myself in that I now see was distracting me from finding my own path in life..but it still hurts so much.SO, I just discovered an amazing opportunity to volunteer in Dharamsala, helping Tibetan school children while also learning about the Tibetan culture and hiking the Himalayas.I asked the I Ching what would come of volunteering in Dharamsala in June, and I cast Hexagram 50, with changing lines 2 and 5, and Transformed Hexagram 33.Like I said I am very inexperienced in interpreting hexagrams, so I would greatly appreciate any comments. Since I got a transformed hex 33, does that mean I should hold back because I am not ready for that situation? or does it mean it would be a good thing for me to go volunteer?"

1655,"I do believe most/all events in our lives have deeper meaning or different meaning than we can immediately see. But sometimes it seems strange that something which feels important to you the way you see it possibly has a different purpose altogether. For instance I got pregnant in October and felt that the pregnancy itself, since it came unexpectedly and in a relationship I felt strongly about, was a miracle and something that was meant to happen but I had a miscarriage in December (with all the stress at the time its no wonder it ended like that, but..) ....So, since it seems that way to me now, maybe I didn't become pregnant because of the pregnancy itself? The whole experience did provoke a big psychological change in my life.Though I usually prefer to ask What if questions and they are more useful to me, I asked:Why did I get pregnant?and got hex 49, line 2 changing to 43(about a month ago I asked a related question ""Is he the man I should have children with?"" and got 49 unchanging)This answer still puzzles me, in a way it makes sense but not entirely.Can you share what you think about this? Thanks,Ana"

1657,"Hey, have you ever done this?  Got so worried or frustrated or baffled about something that you did a toss about it, then worked out an interpretation and done something (or nothing), and then a few weeks later... you look at the situation and your question and what the Yi gave you and you go 'well, of course...it's so obvious...why did I bother asking the Yi?  It's so obvious.'"

1659,"Yesterday I'd asked about hearing from a friend on an important personal issue, then did hear this morning in very encouraging terms.  Today I asked if this will become a romantic relationship in the future [because I'm just getting the sense that it will] and got:  hexagram 15, changing lines five and six, becoming hexagram 53.  So that sounds like it's possible except I can't imagine in this case what lines 3 and 5 could signify.  It sounds like something military!"
1660,"I recently sent a quite personal message and book to someone I've been concerned for, thinking this would help them to progress in emotional healing. They seem to be ""stuck"" in something that is really dragging them down, although they are typically a very strong personality.  Several days have gone by and I've had no response or comment, which isn't characteristic of them at all.  Because we have a slowly developing relationship, and I'm sure there's a lot about them I don't know, I'm concerned what I may have done here.  So I asked the IChing if I do hear from them again, what will their reaction be to what I sent?  I got hexagram 5, changing lines 3 and 5 -- becoming 19.  I suppose this means I'm waiting a while for a reply and there is an eventual response of some kind, but the idea of anybody waiting ""in mud"" is disturbing for a start.  Anybody?"

After some thought I thought let bygones be bygones and when I went to invite N as my friend, I see that my ex has taken me off his chat list! Im scratching my head on why. So N still has not added me, seems like an illusion of friendship!I asked Yi#1 Why didnt N add me on his chat?64Not yet Fording means waiting for the right time to make the right move so that the little fox does not soak it's tail. Is this more like saying to me that N is waiting for the right time?#2 What is happening with the boys and the chat thing with me?17.4.5 --> 24Line 4 says Im trying to trap by pursuing something instead of following it and that to let go of the ego so I can be in the Way.Line 5 says I make the connection.Does this mean to say that to give it time, and things will be ok, that they will be my friends on chat? Hex 24 Return says to let things come and go without affliction and that my Friend comes, and that this is not a mistake. My understanding of 24 is that it can be a return to myself too.#3 Clarification on why ex does not have me on his chat list?36.3 --> 24I will find the central illusion causing this chaos to release the relationship from the pain and suffering.

1664,"The answer to this query is most likely relative, still I am interested in the tally:What is the source of the I Ching's Knowledge?Perhaps it is a reflection/projection of self knowledge.Or perhaps, it is the knowledge of a more spiritually evolved soul whose appointment is to oversee our development in the material plane.Or, could it be from the infinite unification of all things: Love/Universe?I am open to any and all ideas :bows:"
1665,"Hi everyone,An unexpected sum of money  came my way, which I choose to invest in some personal projects that got left behind due to lack of funds. But still some is left, which I could use to donate or contribute to something.

1667,"Hello fellow seekers Happy new year to everyone!A few months ago I met a guy through mutual friends, who seemed very interested in me from word go, to the point of inviting himself along to some things I had organised after that. Since the first few times that we've seen each other though (always in a group situation) he seems to have become hesitant and stepped back into a neutral position as if he's either waiting to see if we have something deeper than just physical attraction or as if there's a block on his part. Or maybe that he's just not interested in me in that way any more. I didn't really reciprocate his enthusiasm the first time we met but I definitely did the couple of times after that, and our mutual friends have hinted enough at trying to match us up. But after those first few outings I retreated from a couple of events because I felt he wasn't really making much of a definite effort to talk to me or make a play for me and I didn't want it to become a situation where he took my presence for granted thinking he could just take his absolute time making any sort of a gesture or move!I'm pretty sure he got the message because he made a huge effort this week at a recent party to focus all his attention on me BUT we're still not anywhere. I realise now that I do like him a lot and would like to explore things further but it's all gotten a bit confusing as to where I stand, so I asked the IC""What does X think I feel for him?"" and I got 61.2>42Does X feel the same way about me that I do about him?"" and I got Hex 16 unchanging.I then asked the same question again just to confirm what 16 meant in this context and I got Hex 31 unchanging.I took 61.2 to mean that he thinks I feel a strong connection with him and that I'm open to exploring this further.I took 16 to mean unbridled enthusiasm but this totally threw me because I don't feel unbridled enthusiasm from him really!!I took 31 to mean that there is mutual attraction - yes?? But that he wants to court rather than seduce i.e. keep the attraction within proper bounds (as per Wilhelm's explanation)SO....in response to whether he feels the same way, I'm thinking the answer is yes but within a controlled fashion??So I then proceeded to ask ""Is he going to make any sort of a romantic move then?"" and I got 49.6 > 13 which I took to mean he will only do so if such a move is available to him i.e. he won't go beyond what is clearly attainable at the time we see each other again socially.I finally asked, ""why is he being so slow and cautious?"" and got 48.5.6 > 18 which I took as meaning that he knows the option is there for him and the way is open but that he has to correct something?? - not sure what that is except maybe the fact he's taken his time making a move and has now got us into a holding pattern??Any help with these interpretations would be greatly appreciated.Thank youSofia:bows:"

1670,"Hello everybody. Well, I don't post much trying to find everything out myself, but this one I'd like to ask. There is this guy I met last summer, he is the reason I've broke up with my ex (9 years relationship), because the moment I saw him I knew: all that had been before was totally wrong. I remember casting a 51(don't remember the lines) after meeting him. And now this again. The whole long and complicated story is still to come later, I believe. We are only friends at the moment. But it occurred to me to ask a question:""Do we match sexually?"" And I got 51.1.5>45.  I was completely calm asking the question cause I know, when I worry I get very bad and depressive answers. Actually I was glad to receive this - I think it's positive.     Line 1 - Shock comes–oh, oh! Then follow laughing words–ha, ha!Good fortune. Shock - well, of course, the mutual pleasure is gonna be shocking for me as I rarely got it from my ex (if ever).     What about line 5? Shock goes hither and thither. Danger. However, nothing at all is lost. Yet there are things to be done. - What is it? Danger of forgetting everything and completely giving in to this lightning? Any thoughts? And the relating 45 - we should get together first? Or is it the outcome?Or maybe I'm completely wrong interpreting this...Your help is very welcome, thanks in advance."
1671,"I am having a difficult time at work with my boss.  I think he is out of his depth and I have no faith in his competence.  He is argumentative and confrontational when there is no need for it and creates problems out of harmless situations.  He is controlling and constantly micromanages without giving any real guidance.  He talks all the time, focuses on trivial things, is nit-picking and has no understanding or appreciation of the important issues.  Because of my background, I understand my job better than he does and this makes it even harder taking instructions from him.  I tried to stay detached but I struggle.  I am so angry that I get home with a headache every day and colleagues have started noticing things are not right.  I know that other people doubt his abilities and he has had problems in the past because of his incompetence.  But I work in a place that is very hierarchical and I know people would take his side if I were to express my frustration.So, I asked the I Ching 'what is the significance of this work situation for me': hex 36. 2,3,4 > 54'how should I handle it':26. 1,2,3,4,5 > 12It looks bleak to me.

1672,"I am quite attracted to a gentleman who asked me on a date 12 days ago. The date plan was to go out Saturday (tomorrow) night for a bite and a performance at 8pm. I accepted the general date and he was leaving town for 4 days. Before he left said ""super we will dine and enjoy the show. I will be in touch after i return."" The last night of his travels he left a message saying he had had a question but nevermind, he found the answer and was being lazy."" I returned the message in any case the following day.All this week not a word from him.The date is tomorrow, approximately 20 hours away. I have no idea if we are still going out but I am very upset, humiliated and do not know what to think or how to treat him IF he calls and acts as if this is still ""on.""I asked the Yi several questions. If anyone can help me understand the answer, I apprecidate it.+++Show me how I should act towards him: Hex 37, liunes 1,3, 5 and 6; and Hex 2. What follows are my general guesses:Line1: Firm seclusion within the family. Remorse disappears. = If he is allowed to exercise his whims and passions he and his parents will eventually regret the indulgence. = act like this is unacceptable. (which, to me, it seems to be. Friends would have called to confirm (or cancel) by now).Line 3: When tempers flare up in the family,  Too great severity brings remorse. Good fortune nonetheless. When woman and child dally and laugh, It leads in the end to humiliation. = Discipline tempered with tenderness is the best means of preserving concord. Too great severity is to be avoided. Nevertheless, in case of doubt, strictness is to be preferred to indulgence and brings happiness. (I should show that I'm not pleased. Its OK to act a bit peeved, but still be accepting? (How, when I am LIVID now and not sure i can cool off after this horrible treatment??)Line 5: As a king he approaches his family. Fear not. Good fortune.When a husband governs his family as a king governs his kingdom (or conversely) all is well. Ruling justly and kindly, evoking love and banishing fear, he brings prosperity to all.  = But i am not governing here.

1673,"Hi,My 7 year old son is on the Autistic spectrum and suffers from mild autism with moderate learning difficulties. He is also very hyperactive, although this seems to have improved a lot over the last year, but has not been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. He is in a special needs class and at one point almost got kicked out the school due to his occasional violent behaviour and lack of co-operation. This has now improved and he has a a teaching assistant for him who provides 20 hrs of classroom support. In the afternoons he goes off to a special teaching unit that was specially funded for him and another boy with problems where he is taken swimming, parks ect.He is generally a pleasant boy who is always smiling and loves chatting and meeting people (although very repetitive and can't have a normal conversation). Although he can have moods swings and quickly become very upset. He can do odd things like always play his Nintendo DS upside down.The health professionals/doctors said it is highly unlikely he would improve greatly or ever be successful academically.Obviously I am very concerned about his future so I asked the Iching: What does my son's future hold?I got H15 modesty with no changing lines as the answer.Any help in the interpretation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
1674,"Hello everyone!I'm starting to get very interested in I Ching divination and still have a LOT of things to learn.

1675,"I would appreciate any help or insight in understanding the Oracle's answer to my question:How will our relationship evolve over the next year?Answer received:Hexagram 42 Increase, changing lines 1 and 6 to Hexagram 8 Holding Together (Union)This question pertains to a relationship that has gone through significant changes over the last few years, following a break up and a process of change to the present state of friendship.I have consulted the I Ching over this period and have made personal changes with less ego involvement, more trust in the process, waiting, small steps, following, more Yin, persevering with trust in myself and participating in the relationship as it exists in a less fulfilling form. Neither of us has had a new relationship or are actively dating.  We see each other regularly as platonic friends and continue to enjoy each other's company but there is no promise of anything more and we live our lives quite independently. It does not satisfy my wish for a companion or life partner in our present form, and sometimes I question whether my effort to stay in this contact with my former partner is a good choice.Receiving hex 42 Increase changing to Union seemed positive for continued positive individual growth possibly leading to healing of this relationship, perhaps a future Union, but I found the line 6 concerning regarding a lack of constancy and misfortune. Thanks for any help in interpretation.Hex 42INCREASE.

1677,"I have an interesting situation. A girl I've been slowly building a relationship with at work has been nominated for a charity date auction. She's very apprehensive about it and afraid she's going to end up having to go on a date with some creep. So I've been considering bidding on her myself. She doesn't know that I'm interested as we're just friends, but I'd like to use this opportunity to show her. However, I have to work on that day so a friend of mine offered to go in my place and do the bidding for me, if I want. This could end up costing me a fairly large chunk of change, but I really don't care about the money. It's worth it to me. I asked if I should let my friend bid on her at the auction for me and my answer was 43.6 > 1. I guess line 6 is about speaking out the truth and the danger of not doing so. But how does it apply in this situation? Is it telling me I should let her know what I plan to do or could the speaking out be a reference to making a bid and the danger against not bidding? Any help in this would be most appreciated."
1678,"Hey guys,I have been invited to attend an audition in 2 days' time . .  it would mean a long journey and fierce competition.  I attended a similar audition last year and came so close to being successful but was just pipped to the post.The whole audition process is very demanding and is done in stages.  I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis almost 2 years ago and thankfully my limbs are not affected (and I hope they never will be!)as my particular strain of MS is all sensory, with particular emphasis on my eyes.  Stress is a real trigger though so it would really have to be worth my while to put myself in the firing line as it were.I have asked several questions relating to attending the audition and although I think the answers are prompting me to go I could really do with a second opinion.  Here goes:-""What will I gain from going to the audition?""Hex 29 unchanging""What is the liklihood of me getting through if I attend the audition?""Hex 14.1.2.4.6 changing to 15""Should I go to the audition?""Hex 48.2.6 changing to 53""How will I be received by the team conducting the audition?""Hex 57.1.4 changing to 1""If I am successful in getting through, how will it effect my life?""Hex 9.1.3 changing to 59They all seem pretty positive except for the second line of 48 unless that relates to my audition last year where I just missed getting through and possibly line 6 relates to success this time??  Also, I don't like hex 9 as it usually relates to ""not much"" . . .I would be so grateful for some urgent advice!Warmest WishesClaire"
1679,"Hey!I haven't posted in a long time but I've been trying to understand my own readings without having to come here for insight (but I do read a lot of the posts, especially the one's about line and hex analysis).Anyway I just asked ""How can I become more intimate with X?"" and got 17.2.3 > 43, usually I'd try to understand the reading on my own but I found that the lines offer contradictory advice:Line 2: Involved with little fellow, lose great person.Click to expand...Now I see this as being to childish and maybe losing the real depth that a relationship can have.Line 3: Involved with great person, loses little fellowClick to expand...I see this as having a real depth to the connection but at the same time losing the childlike spirit and perhaps love??.In Jack Balkin's book both lines talk about immediate gratification and halfhearted efforts, but believe me that is precisely the contrary to what I'm doing/want to do in this relationship, Balkin also talks about self destructive patters but I don't seem to be able to find any other reference to that in any other book.And the relating hex doesn't help much at all (43 ->  Breakthrough).Can you guys please help me understand this one, 'cause this is one of those puzzles that I just can't seem to be able to solve by myself.P.S.: While writing this post I wondered if the word ""especially"" was properly used and found this, that clarified a lot of things for me, it doesn't have anything to do with the reading, just an interesting fact I found."
1680,"Good Morning,My living situation is this - I have moved about 7 times in the last 3-4 years as my marriage broke up. I was forced to sell our home and have been pushed and pulled around in the renting market.I live with my 15 year old son and we both just want to stay somewhere for a long period of time.My 6 month lease runs out in 5 weeks and I don't know whether we will have to move again. Clearly we don't want to but it is also draining me financially so I was trying to look at a cheaper alternative anyway and hopefully start saving for our own home again.My question to IChing was what is the best thing to do in regards to my living circumstancesI received Hex 29.2.5>2ThkuMelissa"
1681,"Hi,wanted to share and consult with you again. The last time I needed advice you guys were really helpful and encouraging. That was a difficult time and I needed help, so thanks for helping. Everything is quite changed in my life right now, at least it feels very different for me. In a way all the bad (maybe better to say hard and painful) things that happened during the last  6 months were good for me and I feel that now. But that doesn't make them less painful. So I'm mostly sad these days but does feel like I'm on the right track. In that sense this hexagram I got is not really unclear to me but I would still appreciate your comments since it is a really important time for me.I had a feeling that a certain cycle in my life has ended and this question was all I could think of...so I asked..What now?and got Hexagram 23 with a lot of moving lines (2,4,5,6)so it seems I am to read the upper unchanging line (3) or is there more to this?This judgment feels natural, there isn't really anything else a could do at the moment and I don't feel I should actually do anything but still would would like to hear what you think....The thing is this letting go is still very difficult for me...especially the part about a man I really do love but can't be with now because he is too unstable and has too many problems. What makes it even harder is that I can feel he loves me and on a certain level we are so right for each other and we both know it, but that  just isn't enough. He has so much he can give me, but he isn't capable of doing it. Now or maybe never I can't tell. I would like it to be only his temporary psychological state but I can't hold on even on that thought. I feel that if I don't let go of everything now, have no expectations, nothing will ever be right....Ah, a bit long I know....the way a feel I could write much much more....Thanks for reading, any comment is welcomed...Ana"
1682,"I wondered if anyone could help please. I consulted the I Ching with the same question twice recently. I asked for any insight regarding my relationship with a male friend of mine and if our friendship might ever develop into more between us. Both times that I asked, it came up with Hexagram 1 changing into Hexagram 2. Please could anyone give me any insight into what this reading means? Many thanks."
1683,"WikiWing says:‘Meeting your equal and lord,Though for ten days, no mistake.Going on brings honour.’It is said that both people who meet are strong. Therefore, under ordinary circumstances one would not follow the other. But since they hold a purpose in common, they cooperate for a 'complete cycle of time,' whatever that happens to be in their case. Some translations say that if they continue together for more than 10 years, 'disaster' will result.I have been getting line 55.1 a lot recently in regard to my marriage, which was formed well over 10 years ago. Maybe we're not aiming at the same goals anymore.  But not all translations stress the '10 days' aspect. For example, the Thomas McCleary translation reads: 'Meeting the partner, though the master is equal, there is no blame. There is worth in going.' He speaks of clarity (the lower trigram) assisting action (the upper trigram). This is because 'action without clarity has no aim, while  clarity without action has no use. Through their mutual sustenance they become useful.' How true! These two lines are interdependent. So I decided to asked the I Ching directly about this: Are you saying that because of 55.1, both strong, I have to go live someplace else? That is, one of us has to leave -- and in our case, that would be me, since my husband says he doesn't want to move. I received H19.5, Dening says: Make sure you're fully informed about the situation. Choose competent helpers. McCleary says this line represents a person who does not trust his own knowledge and therefore 'delegates authority to the intelligent.' It bodes well to do so.Therefore, people of Online Clarity, I'm asking you if you've had your own experiences with this line 55.1? What happened after the initial purpose of the relationship wore off? Was the relationship able to renew itself? Obviously I'm not going to leave my husband because a line says ten hours, ten days or ten years. I'd really like to hear from anybody who knows about this line.Last edited: Jan 19, 2010"

1688,"I was reading a written exchange between a very good teacher and a student, and the student asked him about the usefulness or otherwise of reading spiritual books.  The answer was along the lines of 'reading spiritual books is very useful in the beginning, but can be an obstacle near the end, and you have to know when to let go of that activity'.  So, of course, I wondered how it applied to me, and because I had no very clear idea of how it applied to me, I decided to consult the oracle.  I asked: 'What about the reading of spiritual books in my case?'  The result:1.2>131  I took that to mean that in my case, reading these books is a very good idea.  I mean, the Yi would have come up with something like 43 or 47 otherwise, right?  2  I'm wondering what your take on 1.2 is.  It would have been just as positive if I'd drawn 1.5, for instance, so why 1.2?  The relating hexes for example, are 13 and 14.  So what's the significance of drawing 13 as the relating hex instead of, for instance, 14?"

1695,"I have a friend who has always been fairly financially successful and so he and his family have  lived a good life. More recently, he has hit very hard times. His house is in foreclosure; the Internal Revenue Service (our income tax agency) has frozen his bank account; and he’s maxed out and past due on all his credit cards. He’s  a wheeler dealer type and is now going after giant multimillion dollar deals. He’s never done that before but he has good contacts and he believes that he needs that kind of big win in order to get his financial life back on track. I asked the I Ching about his situation and I got 1:6>43. Line 6 describes him exactly: “When a man seeks to climb so high that he loses touch with the rest of  mankind, he becomes isolated, and this necessarily leads to failure. This line warns against titanic aspirations that exceed one's power. A precipitous fall  would follow.” But I didn’t know what the break-through (Hex. 43) would be. So I asked the I Ching about the break-through, and I got 50:5>44. Is 50 saying that he should get back to simply providing nourishment (food on the table) instead of reaching for the stars, so to speak? And is 44 predicting a further  problem down the road: perhaps a return to the wheeler-dealer lifestyle which created the problems in the first place?"

1698,"Hi folks,Here I am, resorting to your good judgement. Slowly but surely depression has been creeping up in me. I thought I was doing okay last year, working hard, showing I could undertake major tasks. Things went pretty well, but now, it's all falling on top of me. It's like I just can't function any more. My projects from last year aren't finished and I just can't get around to putting a close to them. The new ones are a challenge and I have to coordinate other people, plus do my own stuff. My colleagues from last year's project are angry at me, in part for not giving the right closure. Plus, of the intimate life is a disaster -husband who is sympathetic but just never asks, just gives opinions-, and, in addition, my health is waning. My mother is in bad shape too. I asked the Yi:How can I get out of the depression I'm in?The answer:25no changing lines.25 is definitely a hexagram I have never understood. Kind of calls to action, but at the same time points to ""innocent behavior"". How to understand this in view of my situation. God will I appreciate your answers!Thank you so much in advance.Hulda"
1699,"Hi - and thanks for reading. I've asked about a relationship and am confused - I've been trying to put this relationship aside for a while. I still have feelings and it has been difficult. Please, please help me clarify. I really feel often, like here is nothing there, but I continue to wonder and ask.I don't know how much background I need to supply - a simple version is: we knew one another, there was an attraction, and an argument which broke off any contact. After months, I re-established contact. It was positive - he was open/receptive, but didn't respond to my suggestion to meet. Again after weeks, I left a message and  finally emailed. He hasn't responsed. I don't want to disturb that because I think that when someone isn't in touch - that speaks volumes. I really would like to clarify what is there - and if I should do something. I asked some relationship questions, and here is what I got:What is my position to the relationship: 55 unchanging. What is the position of the relationship: 8.6 - 20His position - 30.1, 3 - 35 What should I do - 18.2, 5- 53Thank you very much, for any help."
1700,"I've been slowly pursuing a relationship with girl A. Not really sure how things are going at this point as she is very private and reserved, but I'm fine with that. It's forcing me to slow down and take my time which I really, really like. Well, recently an old flame has been contacting me. We dated several years ago and got along great. She honestly reminds me of the girl I'm presently trying to move things forward with. I have no intention of giving up on ""A"", as I really do like this girl.. even if I think she might be out of my league. But, the old flame, I'll call ""B"", did spark my curiosity enough to ask a couple of questions.Should I pursue a relationship with ""B""?  28.5.6 > 50Should I pursue a relationship with ""A""? 16.3.5 > 31For ""B"" the image of an old poplar sprouting flowers is fitting as this is an old relationship. But Wilhelm says basically that even though it's successful, everything remains barren and the net result is only the anomaly of the situation. It's also reversed because I'm actually older than she is. Line 6 is an enigma to me because I fail to see how getting in over my head could be beneficial... unless it's pointing out that by getting in over my head I'll realize to see the error of my ways and will learn from it, i.e. don't do it again. How these lines relate to Hex. 50 is also puzzling because 50 seems so pleasant...As for ""B""... Line 3 is me. I am hesitating and it says not to, but it is out of necessity that I do so. It could also be saying not to doubt my feelings because I really do like her.  I think I can relate line 5 to the fact that I am being forced to move slow and that this actually bodes well. It will keep me from trying to push forward too fast. And Hex. 31 ""To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune"" ... I hope I can take this literally lol.How am I doing? Am I close with these interpretations?"
1701,"Hello everyone,it's my first post here... I'd be really thankful if you could share your thoughts with me on the readings I did a few weeks ago. Apologies if I'm writing too much.To give you some background info, this is a relationship question. Last December I broke up a long-distance relationship that lasted approx a year. I felt I couldn't manage his conflicting messages anymore. We were planning a family together, but at the same time he avoided sharing his life/problems with me as much as possible. And whenever I got closer he turned aggressive/defensive. While I always loved him, I started to feel a lot of pain and something had to give. I tried talking, but we clearly weren't able to solve our issues.Anyways, after some suffering, I now feel much more serene. Almost from a day to another, something has happened to me (at this time I did the reading): I know that I needed to make this step and go away. And I know that if we are meant to be together, we will. I am not fighting my feelings, I haven't shut my heart, quite the opposite. I have stopped (well, almost completely) condemning him. In a way, now I am more serene, I love him even more. We haven't talked since, and I know the wrong thing would be to chase him. So. Here are my questions. I hate to ask about the future. So I asked for something else.1. What do I need to do to let go of residual anger, frustration? To find peace with myself? As we are somehow tied to the people we have feelings (good or bad) for, I want to relinquish feelings of hurt pride and preconceived judgement.Hex 42 (no moving lines)2. What was the lesson I had to learn in this relationship?Hex 36 --> 633. How is this relationship evolving? (As I have feelings for him, in a way I am still relating to him even though this story is officially over)Hex 11 --> 424. Is there a chance, now, for the two of us to find a common ground and move forward as a couple?Hex 52 --> 37.I have been studying the i ching for years.

Your input would be greatly appreciated!!!I recently went to a new doctor regarding a health issue that I'm trying to investigate (no clue yet as to what the problem is). She started with reviewing old test results... I got really woried again and asked a question: ""What is the state of my health (as it relates to that issue)?"" I got 17.3 changing to 49.Thank you so much for your interpretation."
1703,"Hi everyoneI'm not an expert, but most of the time, I can interpret a simple situation when I ask the Iching questions. This one time, I asked:""How do I make my family's life better?""The answer doesn't sound good, but for some reason I can't see how it answers my question.It was hex. 36 changing lines 2 and 3 to hex 19Whenever I see hex 19, I'm really scared because of the sentence ""When the eight month comes, there will be misfortune"", especially when I think I will be moving down to south of my state for my education in August. To my opinion, hex 36.2 is trying to tell me, when bad times come, if I just keep hanging on and make sure I can provide for my family as best as I could, then everything will be fine? I can't understand line 3 at all. Ok, so I'm trying to see and understand. I just graduate with a Bachelor's degree and now in pursuit of a Master's degree. I'm in debt and my parents are working really hard to pay for my education. So I asked the Iching how I can make it better, and the iching gives me darkening of the light? Hmm....sorry I'm rambling on hehe. I hope someone can help me with the interpretation? Thank you so much!"
1704,"Hi everyone,I have to make some decisions about work fairly quickly, and am feeling conflicted, confused, and slightly overwhelmed. Usually the i ching helps in these situations, though today I just can't make sense of things.  Any advice would be hugely appreciated...I've been working at job A for the last six months. The pay is good; I feel valued and confident at my job, though sometimes under challenged. The boss knows I may be leaving and/or cutting down my hours, and is persuading me to stay...I asked about continuing with job A: 4.4 to 64Asked for advice about job A: 21.3.4 > 22Job B is trying to recruit me. This job pays less but offers more challenge and potentially meaningful work.Asked about job B: 21.1.3.5 > 33Asked for advice about job B: 22 unchangingI asked about the possibility of working at both jobs (I could work part time at each, but would have to be  secretive about this due to a conflict of interest) : 8.3 > 39 (looks like a bad idea, unless this is just my own fears reflected)So... I'm a bit confused by these readings, especially the 21s and 22s. Sometimes I take 22 to be saying, ""relax, you can't do a whole lot now; and maybe this isn't such a big deal anyway."" Though it seems a big deal to me now, as I need to make a decision ASAP!  FWIW, I'm a teacher and my job requires a fair amount of responsibility.  :bows:Mary"
1705,"Hi, I know this is a bit of a grey area but I'm wondering about how far you can go to try to understand another.I have been in love with someone and still feeling hope for a long time despite adverse circumstances, but suddenly my perspective has changed, I've felt he's dealt another blow and that I'm starting to see the issue as hopeless and my readings are mirroring this state of mind. But in the past, I've felt the readings have encouraged my hope - giving positive answers...I asked the I chingIs there a danger of being led on by the I ching through asking too many Q's?(Thing is the Yi I know is meant to be about truth - but maybe more your truth at that moment, rather than the truth of your outer reality/relationship)33.3 > 12(I actually had hex 12 in mind as I was throwing - feeling this would be saying halt - both in testing the Yi and asking about this relationship. and 33.3 could be about me clinging to the I ching when I'd do better to retreat and lick my wounds...)Is it viable to ask about another's feelings?56.2,4 > 18Could the Yi be referring to itself as a servant (as in 33.3 too?)? I suppose it is - you can't pay a book after all, though I do give it a stroke now and again! But maybe, 56.2 is saying yes you can get help from a trustworthy servant, invaluable to a wanderer (definitely has been) But 56.4 would this be saying you should limit your desires for others? That the I ching is about self-development, not desperately looking for shelter in another? Or confirmation of another's feelings?On the one hand, 56.2 seems to say yes you can trust the Yi to guide you, and 56.4 could be saying that you can ask about other people's feelings and you don't need to feel ill at ease in doing this? Or mistrustful?And hex 18 would you interpret that as work on mistaken assumptions on what the Yi can answer?Not at all sure. I suppose though, you're more likely to drive yourself mad asking about someone else, but sometimes you have to. And sometimes it comes true!...Do you think I should trust that the Yi can be asked any question? And I shouldn't be so suspicious of it? Hmm... but maybe that is too much to wish for. Insight into someone else's feelings...."

1709,"Hi everyone,there's a particular big project which I was asked to put a proposal in for in August which still hasn't turned up (which is often the way with corporate contracts...), so I asked ""what is happening with this project (or will it happen)?"". Between then and now my partnership is breaking up (reasonably amicably), and one partner is supposed to be managing that client relationship, with us having agreed that I will do the work when it happens. I haven't heard anything at all from client or partner so am a bit concerned. I received 48:1,4,6 to 1I'm reasonably familiar with 48, and if I interpret the changing lines as representing a development over time (is that right?) it looks like I should give up for now, nothing is happening, but that it should turn up in the end. I always associate the well with situations which are not open to being influenced, they are as they are in any particular moment. But I'm not sure if that's correct. However 1 has always completely baffled me in any context, I'm never sure how to interpret it at all, so your help with the reading would be very much appreciated!!Thanks so much in advance,E"

I wanted to turn around and email a friend and tell them all about the call cause i knew they would be very sympathetic. But I also know that saying anything just perpetuates the old negativity. But then, this upsetting incident really did happen. Am I not allowed to talk about my life? So I asked the I Ching, ""What's the difference between venting - talking about what happened to get it up and out - and creating - where talking about what happened perpetuates the negative pattern and creates more of the same?""I received 42.4:If you walk in the middleAnd report to the prince,He will follow.It furthers one to be usedIn the removal of the capital.This leads to 25 Innocence.I think this is saying venting to a disinterested third party can be effective, but it seems it is important that the third party really be able to be neutral - or possibly even somebody that is actually a mutual friend who can see the other person's point of view too.Anyway, I thought the answer was a good fit for the question.

1718,"Hello.I need your help about one particular reading I got.I've been in a difficult on/off relationship for over 5 years.We've done many things to each other, good and bad, and several times I just felt so extremely hurt by him that I had to leave. And I knew that if I was unhappy I'd make him unhappy as well and then he'd make me even more unhappy - a circle.But he always knew just the right things to say and then we got back together, for awhile it would be great but then things just rolled downhill again, got difficult again and again I'd leave him, and so around and around in circles.It seems like a small amount of love from him can make me blind to everything that's wrong between us, and it also seems to me that there's something in general about us that I'm blind to.Now we're together, and things seem to be running smoothly for now, but I don't feel relaxed nor happy, only in certain moments. I'm trying; I don't want to see him hurt again. He's trying: he doesn't want to see me leave.I asked the I ching whether we'll make the same mistakes again - as it seems that we've both grown since the beginning - and the I ching answered thus:16 to 29. Enthusiasm to Water.I'm not quite sure what to make of it...Drowning my enthusiasm? The fact that I lack willpower will be the final demise of our relationship?What can you make of it?Thanks "
1719,"I have recently been asking the I Ching about a love interest that was on a good path and recently derailed sort of inexplicably. In any case I have a good deal of confusion whether I should even bother persuing this person especially since my long time love (who I have been seperated from for nearly 2 years) has recently reemerged with some promise of actually getting it right this time. In any case in various readings I have gotten Hex 54, Marrying Maiden in relation to the new love interest (thats kind of fizzled). In the most recent inquiry, I asked the Yi Jing to give me an image of how this person feels for me and I received, Family 37, changing lines 2 & 6, to hex 5 Waiting. In my next question, give me an image of what is at work with my relationship with ""X"" I received hex 19, Expansion, changing line 4, to hex 54, Marrying Maiden. Oi?!I am at a loss. I think this person has been hurt many times and may need me to reassure and take the lead but part of me thinks, do I really want to get involved with someone so damaged. Or, maybe thsi person really doesnt care about me at all and really just is interested in me physically. I was hoping a reading would help clarify where he is coming from and whether he is worth persuing or not but I am still confused. Any help out there?Thanks a million."

1722,"Hi,Just wondering how you all consider the working of the I Ching. Do you accept that it is a book of great wisdom, which can help and pertain to your question or situation no matter what reading you get, or that you are communicating with a higher knowledge (either within yourself or 'out there')? Or do you just accept that it works for you, without so much having a conviction as to why or how, or a mystical feeling?I know this is an age old issue, but I can't help but feel maybe it is all chance, but at the same time, I feel that it can't be. I seem to easily forget when I have been blown away by accuracy when I have these moments of self-, and Yi, doubt...I asked - Can I trust you to guide me?19.5 > 60(I asked this after having asked whether I should buy a camera - I received 33.1,4,6 > 63, which I was initially disgruntled with as it seemed like the best buy considering my needs... I asked again 'Can you elaborate?' - 29.1 > 60). Again I felt that the Yi was warning me against buying it, which was against my own judgement (doesn't usually happen). Because this was an instance where the Yi would not only be guiding my thoughts, but my actions, it prompted me to question what I was doing more, and so I asked the above.I then considered that 33 > 63 might be saying don't probe a done deal? This camera was able to meet my needs and so a balanced issue (ie all in the correct place) and so retreat from upsetting the balance by probing? And then 29 > 60 I felt could be saying limit my questioning on this, as I already know what to do? Also hex 60 could be relating to the Yi's limited ability to advise on technological purchases 19.5 did seem to answer my Q directly too:Hulkscrammer: 'Don't interfere or have doubts about the abilities of those helping you'.Adcock: 'More knowledgable people can help you make the wisest choice'So the Yi could have been responding by saying seek guidance from someone who knows about cameras as I'm limited in this area, or plainly - don't doubt me!(BTW I did buy the camera and all is well with it so far)A few days later I had the same doubt and asked, Can you give me a sign that this isn't all just chance? (I felt - similar to Bostonian in the 'Exploring Divination' thread - that I wasn't really talking to my own, or (more likely given my cluelessnes sometimes), an external greater spirit, but to inanimate objects (three coins) and a well-written book that covers all bases)...31.3 > 45Wilhelm: '...This strong line (me perhaps?) could easily master itself and not yield to every stimulus/influence'... 'little should he yield immediately to every whim of those in whose service he stands'lol.. perhaps this is the Yi saying, I won't answer this question, and indulge your impetuosity? Or that I shouldn't allow myself to be so easily influenced - even by the Yi!?Lise: Do not float along with moods or convictions. The other follows yours – you follow his ... What you do not test is contagious, especially if a great number of people go along.Conversely reading Lise's interpretation it seems to say, form your own enquiry? Decide for yourself? Empirically? (yuck) But again, this is me accepting that the Yi is an autonomous (benevolent) being directly answering my Q? I feel that it is, myself, and I'm sure most do here, but many out there (ie sceptics) do not. And sometimse I hear their arguments...Could I think of another line that could equally fit my Q? Well.. I can think of a few romantic ones, or violent ones, that wouldn't... but then, if I had received them, maybe they too would have helped me in considering the issue in some way?What do you think of these readings?What are your assumptions about how it works? Just briefly even; your instictive rationalization or belief, in using the I Ching to guide and explain specific, personal scenarios?Thanks,Em :bows:Last edited: Jan 7, 2010"
1723,"I would be grateful if anyone could share their impressions of these readings. Feelings keep surging for someone irrationally, and I can't help feeling this is wrong (the reality that there's now nothing).1. Do I just have to trust that things are as they're meant to be? (as in there's nothing I can/should do)44.3 > 6Describes my feelings completely! There is danger of your being influenced by an inner weakness, but circumstances are temporarily preventing it.  As much as you might like to indulge a certain petty desire, you must not do so, at least not right now.  Indecision, in such a situation, can actually be helpful, if it leads to insight and proper action in the long run.Nigel Richmond: He learns to respect circumstances by experience. Not bowing to circumstanes he makes his way LIKE WALKING WAIST HIGH IN THORN SCRUB'2. Is this by some miracle going in the direction I wish for?58Joyous exchange/inner joy3. Is he attracted to me 51.1,3 > 62Aroused in a good way? Or directly about me - shocked into a realisation that I am to stay in the (bird) nest...4. Does hex 58 refer to aiming for being happy without him?8.3,5,6 > 52Here I don't know whether to give precedence to the lines which are negative (8.3: wrong person; 8.5: should not have to force people to join you; 8.6: too little too late...), or positively - holding together requires strengh and purpose (like a mountain)..?  5. Has he forgotten me?59.1 > 61( I thought before asking this if I received 59 that would be saying it is forgotten!) But line 1 talks of the importance of over-coming misunderstandings...6. What is my role, to act out? 26.3 > 41This has me stumped - does it just mean go ahead as I am (not going out of my way and serously consider contacting him), and 41... hold back. But then it talks of working with people on the same wavelength (which I felt he was in the strongest way I've felt with anyone before)Working with people of like minds and strong wills brings good fortune.  In the period immediately following the removal of a major roadblock, take care to remain alert not only for challenges ahead, but also for threats approaching from the rear.  If the “obstacle” was your own attitude, you may have to remove the roadblock more than once.  This is best accomplished by joining with others whose powers of focussed attention are perhaps stronger than your own.My major challenge seems to be living with these strong emotions and being unable to express them. But then feeling if I let it go, it's all wrong... But if he doesn't sense in me what I sense in him, then that's that.7. Is it just not in his nature to care for mine?51.3,4 > 3651.3> shock inducing movement51.4> the shock of fate (the truth hurts)36 > hide your light (be prepared for pain), or hidden potential/light?I feel slightly embarrassed about all these...

1724,"Hello everyone.  Haven't been around in a long time, a lot has developed.  New job, new loves, lost love, increased health and stability . . . I'm very grateful, but I don't know where to go next.The Yi has provided invaluable guidance and companionship through all this.  Not that I could ever be a ""companion"" with the Yi.  But having such wisdom and guidance steadfastly available through every circumstance is an honored source of peace.Anyway.  I think it's time to move on from my current job, I'm resolved about beginning the process of doing that.  But I don't know what's next.I asked the Yi what career I should seek.  The answer was Hex 2 unchanging.I haven't delved into that for follow-up interpretations, because I felt that was a pretty powerful answer.Does anyone have any ideas about what that might mean, in terms of new employment?

1726,"Hello allAfter many years away from 'the book' I have returned to seek its guidance and wisdom. I was introduced to it by my Grandfather, who use to use yarrow stalks for the casting and at the time in my twenties I found the answers to my questions to be too confusing for me to understand. Now in more maturity  I have come back to it with a renewed understanding due to more life experience I think. I am not saying I know any more now than I did then but I think I can decipher answers with a little more ease now and apply them to the questions asked. Having my own books and the yarrow stalks passed down from my now departed Grandfather I would like to try to put them to good use after coming across this great site.So onto my reason for seeking guidance today, after a long time in the wilderness I have met someone at work that I like and think likes me and have asked the question 'Is there any future of me and xxxxxx' To which the answer was 16. Yu/Enthusiasm which is unchanged.The JudgementEnthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers and to set armies marching.I am really not sure what is being said here? but my initial thoughts are to find a go between.Maybe I asked the wrong question. Anyway I look forward to any interpretations and guidance.RegardsTom"
1727,"Hello all,For those of you following my little novel here, a new chapter is coming. Just like Jesed pointed out on a previous thread, I seem to see the horse, apparently.After almost 3 months of asking my estranged husband to meet me (and he repeatedly saying no), he agreed. Many things unsaid in our break-up, many very painful situations, so I been feeling the need to clear the air and stop the corrosion. For the past 4 months I have been having an almost non-stop mental dialog with him, so I'm not sure now what to say. And I'm not sure what will happen inside me when I finally see him.I decided to ask the Yi 2 questions. They might overlap, but I guess they will give me insight:- How should I act /what should I say in my conversation with him?16.2>40It seemed pretty relevant, not sure if really helpful as on ""what"" to do.16 --> Enthusiasm. Worthwhile to set helpers and move armies.To me, 16 speaks of energy and mobilization..2 --> To be firm like stone, it doesn't last a day (or, according o Bradford, an unending day), persistence is promising. It's correct and central.Talks about finding the center and staying there. Lyse says is about opening the heart when appropriate. I guess is a good line, and the main thing here is to find a balance, but apparently on has the skill to see things as they are, past the possible delusion of enthusiasm. Now, if it only were that simple! Finding the balance, fine... but how???40 -->Release, liberation. Think it my fit my overall attitude towards this. I have been mulling over things for months (not consistently or with any clear conclusions) and I need to let out. Plus, I'm not clear yet if there's anything worthwhile left between us, and this hex contemplates both possibilities (return is promising if there's no place to go; to move forward is promising if there is).  Now, what interested me the most of this hex was the image: ""Thus the noble one forgives transgressions and removes guilt"". I guess this spoke better for me as to what attitude to take: a forgiving, understanding approach.Second question:- How will the meeting and possible effects of it develop?17.5>5117 --> FollowingTo me, speaks about a true dialog, when all the time one is following the other, alternatively. I was glad I got this hex, usually when I get it it talks about a situation that could be pleasant. I know that this conversation will be filled with tension, but this gives me hope it doesn't have to be excruciating. .5 --> Again, correct and central, a promising line, very similar to 16.2. To follow excellence, to follow what's good and correct. This gives me hope the talk can rectify wrong doing on both sides. It talks about trust and sincerity, very much needed between us.51 --> Shock, Thunder. This may sound strange, but shock (for him AND for me) is what I'm looking for. To go in one direction or another, but remove this feeling of limbo and stagnation. Shaking things up will be a better result for me than just hanging out and having inconsequential talk.So I wanted to share my reading, hoping that anyone could either validate, correct or add to my interpretation. Any thoughts will be very welcomed :bows: ,as well as any ""off-reading"" suggestions on how to organize mentally for this meeting.Cheers,Flor."

(*edit unless 22 referred to the profession my masters would lead to, which is completely different than the profession i am in now.)After reading the memorizing thread, i began to get the impression that i need to identify my true resources, so that i might better use them to my benefit. over all, i felt the response was too vague for me to get an idea of how to really do this without depending on everyone.... you know, to just be able to do this on my own...please, please help. i'd greatly appreciate it. i'm ready to get on with my life."

1738,"Hi allI asked a question today and drew hex 49 unchanging which confuses me.  Actually readings where the hexigram is unchanging is very confusing to me.  I am practicing to play music, and I play in a couple of different venues around town strickly for socializing and entertainment.  I've only been playing for almost 2 years and need lots of practice at home, which I do almost daily.  But I sometimes struggle to keep up the discipline.  Anyway when I asked how my musical venture is going I got 49 unchanging.  49 is about things being out of balance right and needing a radical change?  How can change be unchanging?  Thanks for any reply.:bows:"
1739,"I recently had dinner with a long-time friend and we agreed to meet again this past Sunday. He cancelled because he was sick, and subsequently sent an email admitting to really enjoying my company the first time, and complimenting me in a more-than-friendship type of way. I am overjoyed as I feel the same way, BUT I do not want to overstep boundaries. The two of us have been doing a strange song and dance for some time... the main issue being he seems to want me to take the lead, and I want him to.So he admitted to some degree of ""more than friendship"" in this message. And bc i do not want to step into the role of ""leader"" I am VERY confused about how to reply and what to say, or how much to admit to. (Being a girl i can already imagine moving in with him and choosing new curtains but i nkow saying that would likely scare him away!)It's a question of balance and I dont have the answer as i'm very very very bad at all this ""flirting game"" stuff.I asked the Yi how to reply to this email, hoping it would give me some clue of how much to admit to. It told me 51.1,3,4, 6 and then 52.Since 52 is stillness i'm not sure what that means, and all of these lines seem to be pointing out conflicting things. As I see it, the interpretations are:line 1: Fear teaches us a lesson from which we can learn to our advantage. (I am afriad about misstepping so i'm not sure how to act, and i feel caught - frozen sort of).Line 3: ""there are times when it is wise to act upon the spur of the moment. This is one of those times. Even though the act of impetuosity may bring little advantage, it will certainly do no harm. (this contradicts the first line which points out my sense of immobility...it says act altho it wont change things. But what to do? Act how?)Line4:  Shock has produced dazed confusion. Wait for conditions to improve. (this says wait)Line 6: Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around. Going ahead brings misfortune. If is has not yet touched one's own body But has reached one's neighbor first, There is no blame.One's comrades have something to talk about. = To attempt any action at this time would be foolish. (action would be foolish; wait).OK so i have -- act, wait, and wait.Then hex 52 which says wait.But I have to reply... I""m really not sure what to do here."
1740,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years who has helped raise my 7 year old daughter in our time together. He had offered to talk to her about it, provide some sort of closure and explanation. I agreed, and just let him know the details of that meeting would be up to him, just let me know. Its been 6 days and he hasn't responded. At all. I asked, ""What is it that I need to understand about what is taking him so long to respond?"" (I phrase it that way when a situation is giving me anxiety because I don't know something, and knowing/understanding is what I am seeking in order to quell the anxiety.)Now, I got 13.2 --> 1. I read this thread here, where the same hxs were received, and though the situation is radically different, I know there is a connection somewhere.Is the ideal situation of the three of us meeting and discussing this the 13? And the 2nd line changing maybe might be either some ulterior motive on my part, or his part? And what of the 1st hx?"

So I asked:- What if I try to contact this person today to see what the response is?32.2>62It appears to be an action coherent with how I stand, therefore, no regrets.

Just latley he has been getting a little demanding like how much I should be payed etc . I mean there I know real problems as yet but I have feeling he may ""possibly try to make things difficlult .Things are going well at the moment and that has nothing to do with any effort he has put in and he is well aware of it as it has slipped out a couple of times.He is just not consistent person and changes his mind very easily.How should I handle this situation I recived 50.4.6>46I see this is possibly him being represented by the 4th line and me in the 6th as basicaly what I have said he tends to like to control things but as I said he is not consistent I mean because I am the business I live a breath it at the moment.The other thing  could line 4 mean that he could spoil things or make life difficultWould love some outside feedbackSteve"

I don't really NEED a new job at this time, but it would be something more in line with what I plan on doing with my career in the future. I had a couple of concerns so I asked""What would the result be if I applied for the job my friend mentioned to me?"" The answer was 8.1 > 3The other question was ""How will taking the job my friend mentioned to me affect my relationship with T?""The answer to this one was 35.5 > 12""T"" is someone I've been very, very slowly developing a relationship with. We are co-workers at the moment so it's a sticky situation. Though we rarely see one another at work. This answer is particularly baffling to me as I cannot, for the life of me, understand how a time of progress can be associated with stagnation?!?! Line five says ""Take not gain and loss to heart. Everything serves to further."" But if everything serves to further, then why is stagnation the resulting hex? Is there something about hexagram 12 I'm not seeing?!?! Or is it not really answering my question and instead saying ""Don't worry about it. Nothing is going to stop you from making progress in this matter. If you continue to worry about it you will end up with stagnation.""  I have some time to figure this out as the position isn't going to be filled until the summer time, but I would appreciate some insight.Thanks! "
1746,"Hi allI asked this question: ""What would success looks like for me"" Got 61.2 > 42I am well aware that the answer to this question won't give me a detailed plan on how to achieve that potential success, but it can perhaps help me discover what aspects of myself could, if I develop them, lead me in its direction. It is a professional issue in a broad sense. I am currently unemployed, and I feel today like a blank sheet where many things could be drawn. It means that there are as many chances that I end up like a hiccuped baby drawing or a Rembrandt's one.My first thought after reading several posts here about 61.2 42 was that my question was too general to help me in anyway at the present moment. But well, it isn't a problem as I know that although I would like some concrete action in my life now, I'll better begin with a general picture from where I can descent progressively towards the day to day action.But then, as I tried to write down my understanding of the hexs, it strikes me that it could well describes a dream I have since a few years and that I have been trying to bring to reality all along year 2009 without success.My dream is to become a journalist. Not just a plain journalist, but one that has the freedom to speak freely on delicate matters, bringing different truth to the readers/listeners than the one unique truth we get day after day from our medias (here in switzerland). You'll understand that this is really only a dream as I don't even have an appropriate formation.I am not too old for running after a dream, but I am too old for running for years after an unreachable dream... So what is your opinion? How would you understand these hex?"

1752,"I have a friend who has a piece of property that has two houses on it, a front house and a back house. She is getting on in years and the responsibility of the upkeep and dealing with tenants is getting to be too much for her. She is considering dividing the property and selling the back house. I think this is a very doubtful proposition, mainly because the houses have a shared driveway. However I don't know all the ins and outs so I asked the i Ching a rather vague question, ""Could what my friend has in mind work out?"" I received 13.3 > 38.I interpret 13.3 to mean selling the house would indeed be a good idea and 38 to mean that the new owner and the front house tenant could get along with the small matters sharing a driveway involves.But I'm still very doubtful of the wisdom of this plan so I'm wondering if anyone has some insight they could share?Thank you!Rosada"
1753,"This has got me really stumped. To summarize  the  situation1. UNLESS X occurs within the next ten months or so, I probably should move.2. In terms of strict odds, it’s unlikely that X will occur. However, I have interpreted a number of previous I Ching readings to say that despite the odds, X WILL occur. Of course, I could be misinterpreting those readings especially since I would like X to occur, so perhaps wishful thinking is coloring my interpretations.3. I’d prefer not to move. However, since I own my house, moving might be a bit difficult and take some time (for example to sell my house, buy another one, etc.) So it might be better to get started early if I am going to moveI asked the I Ching what I should do about this and got 57:1,2,3,5 >27Here are some of my problems with the reading:While the  text does say “It furthers one to have somewhere to go,” most of the discussion about gentleness and gradualness seems to suggest that I should not act precipitously but take a wait-and-see stance. In other words, wait a while and see what happens.Line 1 does describe my current situation:  “one is, however, not minded to withdraw but drifts indecisively to and fro” and it urges: “military decisiveness is the proper thing.” First of all, I’m a little confused about why this line about military decisiveness would be part of a hexagram that’s all about small movement and gentleness. But anyway, it seems to me that opting to wait and see by definition is not decisive, right? So this line may be suggesting that I move now.Line 2: Do the “hidden enemies, intangible influences” noted in this line represent my wishful thinking that led me to incorrectly interpret past reading of the I Ching as predicting that X will happen. In other words, is this line saying: my past readings are wrong; X will not occur; better move now.Line 3. “After a matter has been thoroughly pondered, it is essential to form a decision and to act.” Well, duh, that’s what I’m trying to do.Line 5. Aarg!!! Now we seem to be back to don’t act precipitously; wait a see for awhile.Last edited: Jan 9, 2010"

I asked what she wanted from me and i got 13.1 chaning to 33 which i already got an answer to. Basically saying that i withdrew and she wants to be friends, but i dont.  So anyway today shes contacting me again.  I know this women.  Shes broke.  She used to work with/for me and i always used to try to help her understand finances.  So anyway when we broke up 5mo ago and she finally got a job after working together for 4yrs, i told her it was hard out her and she bascally said whatever.  So now her bills are behind and HER stuff is getting cut off.  So now shes calling me.  I already told her im not her ATM, so my question was (Where does she want our relationship to go from here) and i got 54.1 chaning to 40.  54 was always a mistery to me.  Something about being married and a concubine or something to that effect.  My next question may be a little more interesting???"

I have stuck to my decision and any attempts on his part to contact me have been deflected by me so I have not seen him or spoken to him in over 10 months but I have reason to believe he will attempt a reconciliation in the near future.My question to the I-Ching was   'Is xxxxx likely to come back into my life?

1760,"Regarding a particular endeavor I asked what, if anything, I needed to change, something I was doing wrong.  I received 44.3.  I then asked for an image of what in me 44.3 referred to, the evil element or petty desire and got 11 unchanging.  I was stumped, peace as the element that needs changing, what???  Then I read something Jeff said in a thread where someone else got 11 at a time when they were not feeling particularly peaceful.  He referred to peace as sometimes being a time of not doing anything, not changing or growing.  Looking at it that way, coupled with the fact that 44.3 is an evil element you are prevented from interacting with, makes a certain kind of sense.  My life is anything but peaceful, so maybe it is letting me know that there is a purpose to the unrest in my life, that having peace would actually make me complacent or rob me of self development that's needed.  What do you guys think?  Does that make sense to you?  Is there anything else you see that I missed?  44 is one I rarely get so am not as familiar with.  Does it always refer to something sexual or can line 3 refer to any undesirable element?"

I'm concerned for a few reasons....one, he's going through a divorce and I (due to my personal morals) feel a little strange about that circumstance...two: I have been going through an extended (extremely)rough patch with an ex bf and am just recently, for the first time in 4 years, starting to feel  as tho I might *truly* be getting free from that disastrous mess...To me, this seems a dangerous and difficult combination for any 2 people starting something of any nature..so I asked the IC for some insight and advice into the connection.Response: 27.1.5 changing to 20.This seems to be saying (IMHO): 27.1:that there may be potential here of something good as long as there's wisdom (ironically, tying to make wise choices is why i consulted the IC about this )27.5:  Pause...do not move forward at this time 20:  Stand back and think long and hard about thisHmmmmm...... lots of ""pausing"" and ""thinking"" seems to be recommended here...and yet line 1 seems to be saying there's good potential....I would love to hear others' thoughts on this...I do want to be wise and cautious here, but to be honest, I also feel that I've been in the ""pause and reflect mode"" in relationships for quite some time already...Any thoughts?"

1765,I need to get clarification on the second hexigrams.  I always thought that the first was about now and the 2nd was to come.  But on some of my questions the interpreters were saying the opposite.  Whats the correct way to interpret this.  What made me think about this was I asked a questionWhat does she want from me and I got 13.1 changing to 33 which strikes me as strange.13.1 is saying something about fellowship before the gate and to avoid secret unions but then 33 is to withdraw.  Are these contradictory?
1766,"Hi- thanks for reading. If any of you have experience - In this area, that would be great.Basically, I ask the I ching often, about the other person's perspective within a relationship.- it gives me hope often times, and moves things forward for me, regardless of the situation; where things are and that person's response.For example - Here's a situation - what is his perspective - 54 - 24.  etc. He hasn't been back in touch, but I feel there is something in the future. Asking bothers me - the question - How does he feel- not only feeds my hope, but feels invasive. What has worked for you in this situation - focusing on yourself or the other in a respectfully asked question ( is there one?) Thanks."

Could it be some kind of national economic alliance. For example the U.S. being the older man and China being the young wife? (China is, of course older in years but it is younger as an economic superpower). Actually, that line might be impossible to figure out since it could be anyone or any countries or even any two concepts or two theories of economics or laws."

If you ever lost a loved one you can relate. so I asked the questions.  What is the possibility of reconcilliation with x and I go 62.5 changing to 31.Show me how to bring about reconcilliation with x and i got 32.1.4 changing to 11How does my x feel about reconcilling our relationship and i got 57.2.4 &6 changing to 31.If someone could offer some insight into this i would appreciate it.
1770,I asked the question (what changes should i make to attract my soulmate? the answer was 40 <3 changing to 32.  I have no clue on this one.  Something about not getting robbed....
1771,"Hi allsorry to be a pain but it has been niggling me mainly his blase attitudeI asked straight out will I get my money back from G30.1.2.3>64I am starting to get lost maybe I should have just asked this in the first placeIs the Yi basicaly telling me not to dwell on this, I am starting to get a forest from the trees situation I had positive feelings from the first 2 readings Line 2  is  fantastic Line 3 is where I get this feeling of maybe I am dwelling on this situationSteve"
1772,"Hi dear community,First I would like to wish you all a very good year! May you all have a creative, healthy, lovefilled year, with challenges that are reasonable and enjoyable. I hope the Yi works with you in a positive and conforting manner.I'm writing you now because I have certain health concerns and have been somewhat worried lately (inability to sense smell, for example). I will be doing a CT scan on Monday and wanted to prepare for it. I asked the Yi:How is my health?The answer: 36 with changing lines 1 and 2, going to 46. I became even more worried, needless to say. Does 36 mean I have a hidden problem? Or that my life is darkening?Darned, 36 seems to follow me !Any thoughts will be welcome.Thank you in advance,Hulda"

1774,"Hi allin a bit of a situation here, basicaly i have paid a person some money in advance to do a job sub-contarctor. He is a neighbour of a friend and I have known him for a while. He started the job well but at the moment he is not responding to emails or phone calls. The problem I have is that the client is putting  pressure to see a preview of the work and they are increasingly becoming unhappy, i have let him know this but nothing still seems to happen. Basicaly he responds when he feels like it and doest seem to have a concept of deadlines, he suppose to come up with something by tomorrow which he could I suppose but never the less the communication situation is still an issue,He was very keen to take the money but where are the goods.I asked the Yi what should I do about this situation recived 5.2.3.5>24 waiting is exactly the keyword here, any idea, its so annoying because the rest of my business is running so smooth.would appreciate some imputSteve"
1775,"Hi AllI have been dealing with a sub-contractor that has been a complete nightmare.He is a friends neighbour who is suppose to be doing some work for me.

1777,"Happy New Year to All,  Hopefully I can get an opinion on a reading I just took. I just found out somebody I had been interested in and communicating with off and on for some time is indeed quite involved, and probably permanently, with somebody else. Just as a final inquiry I asked the I Ching:                    What does she think of me? 61.3.4 --> 1Even though its concluded Im still curious to get some idea. Thanks very much"

1780,"Hi everyone,Just thought I'd share this and it would be iteresting to hear ideas on it.I was deeply saddened by Brittany Muphy's death a couple of days ago. And it made me think of death in general -the enormity of it - and I felt I could ask the I ching about it (holding in mind everyone I knew who had died - from people to pets)I asked Where do they go?5,3,4,6>10As I read the lines it seemed to say that sometimes death is the only way out of a dark or dangerous situation. I heard the actress had health prolems, and was painfully thin. I've loved her films - she was so endearing too. It's sad that she seemed to live up to the Hollywood image as the spotlight on her grew. But I think that'd be so easy for anyone - especially if you love what you do but have to make sacrifices to stay up (or at least you're made to feel that way through media pressure, or the general concensus that has created an image of what to aspire to in terms of looks..), and I think this coupled with underlying health problems was too much. Though of course I didn't know her. But I take comfort from the reading. Perhaps death lifts people out of unlivable situations onto differnent or more suitable road? A release if you're in a lot of pain..5.3> talks of being in a serious situation that could injure (such as I suppose deteriorating health)5.4 > 'The situation is extremely dangerous. IT is of utmost gravity now--a matter of life and death. Bloodshed seems imminent. There is no going forward or backward; we are cut off as if in a pit. Now we must simply stand fast and let fate take its course.'5.6 > 'The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a move on one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.'I like the last line as it holds an image in mind for me of a benevolant hand lifting you out of a dangerous state... light entering the cave.And hex 10 > Could be referring to treading the journey of life? Getting closer to a higher power? That we tread with mortal human footsteps, and gently progress - standing on the shoulders of giants? Or that the higher power does not bite - death is not to be feared?I just really do feel sad for her mother. Those that we leave behind..I think this reading says... sometimes for people there's no other way out, from living in a dark cave you can be elevated somewhere else and that can be beneficial though of course we can't see where they go.. and hex 10 could be reflecting our vulnerability and limited perspective, but that we needn't fear?Any thoughts? I know it's a dark subject, but it really has touched me.:bows:"
1781,"Hi all,My third post in as many days as I continue my search for true love through internet dating!So I was shown interest from several but 2 in particular got my attention and we started emailing but they didn't really 'rock my boat' so to speak but then I got a msge showing interest from someone else and when I clicked on his photo my heart literally skipped a beat I'm sure and it made me realise I was settling for less than I shld be so.....I asked if  my connection with the xxxx wld  blossom into romance and I am aghast to say I got 23.4.6>16 although Enthusiasm sounds good to me. what going on with this contradiction?????thks from one wanting to find true love againMelissa "
1782,"I've been juggling two consultation methods for a few days now, trying to make a decision on which to continue with. The options are between three coins or a string of 64 beads that hold the same probability as the 3 coins i.e 8,8,1,1. Haven't made a firm decision yet, but I went ahead and asked which method would be best for me. For the beads I received 11.4 > 34 and for the coins 50.2.4 > 52.  I think, in the end, it doesn't matter which I choose, but I'm curious how these answeres apply?"
1783,"Hx 13 changing to 53 was the response to a question about whether a collaboration I have with someone at work would continue and develop into something fruitful. Although 13>53 sounded optimistic, I interpreted the changing lines in Hx 13 to indicate that it would not be plain sailing, that it might require the two of us to somehow distance ourselves from the existing politics in our respective departments to make the collaboration into a long-standing one. Could the reading be also suggesting what our respective roles should be to make the collaborative effort successful?  Hx 53 - let things improve at a pace set by him (my collaborator) and not by me? Looks like a lot of layers in this reading...So then I asked the Yi to comment on the correctness of my overall interpretation(!!!), which was that the collaboration would work out in the end; and the response was 46.2>15.  I dont quite understand this changing line, and particularly the reference to the small sacrifice. Is the Yi just saying yes, the interpretation is correct, or is it perhaps saying that I will need to make some sacrifices before the collaboration can solidify? Thank you for any help or insight that you can give me on this.ShobhanaLast edited: Dec 28, 2009"
1784,"Hi all, after your thoughts and interpretation of my ear problem reading, which seemed to suggest that abandoning my cart and going to a simpler existence that includes walking and meditation, I waited a few days and asked just now about the outcome of a move from NYC to Atlanta. The ear problem suddenly flared three days before we first came down here, improved here, and got much worse on our return to NYC for six weeks before returning here now for a month to look for housing. The reading on a move seems auspicious but would like your insights if you wish. I got Sun 41 fifth line moving (41.5 as you would say) moving to 61 inner truth. I do see Atlanta as beneficial 'decrease' as we're looking in a more rural area. Not the city itself. A cheaper lifestyle closer to nature etc. One reason I asked and I might do one more reading (tho I don't like to overuse the I Ching as that dilutes it's messages I feel) is that when I finally overcame so many obstacles health and practical and we were ready to come visit in Oct six months later than planned (I've been to Atlanta five times once for nearly a month but my partner had never been so had to see his impression first) that is exactly when this ear and balance issue became severe and persistent. It seemed if I was making a good move I shouldn't suddenly face one more huge obstacle. It does seem a good move tho. So I may ask the I Ching the meaning or cause or purpose of the ear issue but I'll wait a week or so."
1785,"Good morning,Well I asked if I shld continue to communicate with a man I 'met' via internet dating(we have not met in person yet). The answer Hex 18.3.6>7This from Legges translation -The third line, undivided, shows a son dealing with the troubles caused by his father. There may be some small occasion for repentance, but there will not be any great error.has made me ponder my son's take on his mum(me) finding romance with someone other than his father. When I showed him the photo of the guy on the internet he said he felt there was something not quite right about the way he looks.The story being, it is essentially his dad that caused our 18 year marriage to breakdown and cause it to end.Other than that I don't really know what it all means - Line 6 to me means I will do what is right for me.thks for your help and have funMelissa"
1786,"Dear Wise OnesHope you had a lovely Christmas and I wish you a plentiful New Year (even though Mercury and Mars are Retrograde right now!!).So, I have been asked to cover an event where X will also be going and I am in two minds as to whether I should tell him I'll be there, too or whether I should just turn up and say hi if / when we bump into each other...I am obviously interested in him romantically etc  so I asked these questions:What would be the outcome if I told X I will be at the same event next week?61.2 > 42What would be the outcome if I didn't tell X I will be at the same event next week and we happen to bump into each other?53.6 > 39 It seems that whether I tell him I will be there or not, the outcome will be rather positive but but I am puzzled about 39 in the second one - Obstruction (!!)...What are your opinions?

1787,"Hi, I use a 'mild' inflatable home hyoerbaric oxygen chamber that goes to a pressure equivalent of about 11 or 12 feet deep. It helps ameliorate my symptoms of chronic Lyme disease. Nearly ten years ago when I got my bad case of Lyme I found that hyperbaric helped more than antibiotics. I went several times for a month or two at a time for daily sessions in clinic chambers which go to an equivalent of 50 feet depth and use pure 02 from tanks. My ears did fine. Itcwas expensive though and time consuming and when I stopped I got worse again. So I got the home chamber which tho not as effective does help.Four or five years ago the home chamber needed repair and a nurse with Lyme who had her own professional clinic chamber in her home and had trained as a hyoerbaric tech to learn to operate it and self treated offered a free session. I actually didn't need it since there was a mild portable at a chiropractor's office nearby I could use until mine was fixed. And she had a monochamber where you lie flat and I don't like those as they make me claustrophobic. But it was a nice offer so I went.  She must have pressurized too fast as I had barotrauma (like a scuba diver gets) and that ear has had isues ever since. It can make me feel off balance and get swelling or congestion.But a few months ago it got much worse and after gping in my chamber I havd had very persistent mild vertigo, clicking, and upsetting steadiness when I walk. At night lying down I have an internal sensation of moving. It's all very perturbing.  Yes I went to an ENT but she wasn't much help so far which is typical of HMO medicine these days.Needless to say I ruminate often and with sadness and anger that I ever went to that stupid nurse's chamber where her unprofessional or hurried technique caused me lasting problems especially since hyperbaric is so helpful to me. I look back and feel it was all so unfortunate and unecessary. I know she treats others at times as well.I just did an online reading on this and got Grace with first line moving so shifting then to Keeping Still. My question was how to heal my ear tho I really just mean the current balance and dizzy issues. Maybe I should also ask why it happened.Needless to say I am upset over"
1788,"I aksed about the overal atmosphere I can expect in my personal 2010, and received hex. 48.1.5 moving to 11.This year has been very turbulent: I caused some upheaval in my life, some things have settled down while some are still in the process of change. The plans for the next year are vague though wishes are clear and those involve some travelling.Now, as I see 48, it talks about reaching the very core of one's being, one's life, being in touch with oneself. However, it also forewarns us that neither being stuck in the rut is good nor is being too absorbed by the external as to neglect our self-development.line 1: seems rather unfavourable, but in the context of my annual question, it seems as if it's describing this year: old models of behaviour, old rules do not apply anymore. Time to move on. Which is the process that I have already started.line 5: offers quite an optimistic outlook, though, saying that if one uses one's potential, if one puts words into actions - only the good can come.The resulting hexagram, 11, seems optimistic in its very name, since PEACE is really what I'm hoping to achieve, whatever it's form might be.I would like you to comment on my analysis and tell me if I am too far off the mark.Thank you in advance."

1790,"Dear All, If anyone can help with this I would be so glad!I asked the Yi this question: ""If I go to the country where the girl I love lives will my efforts and perseverence be sucessful (marriage, happiness)?"" The Yi gave the response of hexagram 32 with no changing lines. How should I understand this? I have read the forum posts on Hexagram 32 and if I understand correctly it has a core meaning of something being stable or enduring. I have read in WIllhelm that this hexagram can relate to marriage. From the forum I have also read that it can mean that the present state of affairs can perpetuate itself. This could mean something negative.I will try to give some background detail. This relationship has been going on for two years. We get on together really happily. ""Happy as sand babies"" is the phrase that comes to mind! We do not have any personal difficulties of any kind. We dont argue, or fall out etc.However the situation is that there is another person who she also loves. Both he and I live in different countries from each other, and from her. So it has been possible for her to avoid making a real choice, which would have been forced upon her if we all lived in one place. When we are together, she is very happy, peaceful and it makes a great difference to our relationship. But the practical situation is that we are not together often, and when I am not there, the other person she loves visits, and this strengthens their connection. And so it revolves from him to me and back again.It is clear that she cannot chose between her two suitors. And although it may seem unusual it is really true that she has deep sincere feelings for us both. Obviously we mean something different to her, both of which she values.  Both of us are really devoted to her. She does not have any doubt about our commitment to her.There is therefore a repetitious quality to this relationship, essentially that she cannot bring herself to make a real commitment to me for fear of losing him, or to him for fear of losing me. Its as silly a situation as you could wish for, but unfortunately it is being lived by all three of us. I thought the main problem is that she doesnt have either of these two men in her life on a real daily basis. It is hard to choose between two people that you see infrequently. I thought, being there, being together is the only way of solving this. ""I thought if I am asking for commitment I should show it. Actions not words"". But for me, this is a big step which involves relocation to another country, another job etc. So the thought of failure in this relationship is a little scary. I wouldnt be worried about it was an established relationship. I would jump with delight at the chance to be together.I was also anxious because, this situation of course creates problems of honesty and trust. I should acknowledge that she avoids telling me when he will visit essentially being too frightened of the pain it will cause her and I. He doesnt know that she has a relationship with me, but of course has some intuition about it. But she also doesnt say to him or to me that either are her boyfriend (I dont want to paint her in a bad light). So I asked the Yi and received this reply of hexagram 32. Can you advise me how I should know how to interpret it? The judgement says:Duration. Success. No blame.Perseverance furthers.It furthers one to have somewhere to go.Perseverence futhers: This seems to indicate, that making an effort (perseverence = effort?) is helpful towards stability. It furthers to have somewhere to go: Does this suggest going to her, brings the stable and enduring relationship?Then the Image says: Thunder and wind: the image of Duration.Thus the superior man stands firmAnd does not change his directionIs the message dont go (dont change direction)? Or is the message, ""your going there is a direction which should not be changed""?Is the image that of a man who despite thunder and wind (difficulties, buffeting, troubles! etc) remains stable, and because of this stability there comes success?(Often when I ask about this relationship, and what will happen I receive the 32.3 or 32.1)Then also I am puzzled about some points made in previous posts about Hex 32: One possible interpretation seems to be that 32 indicates stability in the sense of a situation ""continuing as it has been"". But when I think of this, it seems that if the Yi had meant this, it could have given me the answer in another form to show this, particularly because my question asked about success (marriage happiness). Could it be that by 32 the Yi means continuation of this unhappy situation? The other idea perhaps means is that the instability will go and be replaced by a stable ""succesful"" relationship?  Maybe there are other meanings to 32? I would be really grateful for your insights and clarifications.Thanks for reading all of this!Last edited: Oct 30, 2006"

1793,"Happy holidays to all of you!I'v been thinking whether to post this or not because I feel kind of blushy here thinking of my age and the situation implications and complications. This is nonsense but here it goes. several months ago I had a crush on somebody and the worst second thing is that he's married. (feeling like a monster and going against my principles I let this wonderful feeling go on) I definitely feel it was both sides but... I feel deep in my heart that he has something never before found in anyone, but always wished.Well, after giving a second -and more than that- thoughts I asked the Yi ""What does X feel for me. soon I realized how stupid my question was, when Yi fired me back with 8.2.3 So I asked how far can I go with him?  and got 39.2.4 ( then I saw a post by Frank here about the same and took his question borrowed because it fitted my needs. Sorry for that Frank, hope you don't mind lol) and asked the Yi: Ok,I like X, what can I do best to let our bond grow towards a solid, strong, commited and long lasting bond? and then I got 31 plain. No changing lines. Despite the impropriety of such a situation, what can I expect from it? Thanks in advance.By the way he doesn't know anything about my feelings at all, besides he lives overseas.

1798,"A very cold christmas here. Minus 8 below. On my way over to IT room in community buildings the ice was very bad. It reminded me of a recent cast 30.1- 56. tread, polish, respect. A little trip over ice, or dont trip & fall on the ice ? A neighbour popped in & volunteered he had a bit of a fall on the ice. I've noticed this icy connection before.Most recent cast 30.3.4.- 27Pre christmas shopping & the weather exceptionally cold.Picked up a bad cold & sore throat , so I was careful eats & drinks. But not careful enough. Became quite ill , but much better next day. Also got this before for a late night, sudden, vicious but transient illness. At least I hope thats all it is."
1799,"Deep in the heart of winter, so close to winter solstice and the New Year, now seems to be the time for introspection and a sort of spiritual housekeeping.  I took a walk this evening by the water and did soul searching about what I wanted for myself in the future and how I would have to change to achieve a particular goal in my life.  This goal has to do with something in my life that I fail at, repeatedly, always.  I’m sure I fail at this because I’m my own problem. I think I know what attitudes need to change, and I have a plan that i hope will help me change them.  When I returned home I felt like I needed to ask Yi for advice.  I'm beginning to trust Yi after getting some surprisingly insightful readings.  I could just give up on this goal and for years that was exactly my attitude, but now I do and I really want to fix this.I asked Yi what is happening right now and what I need to know.  I definitely didn't want a prediction, I’m only asking about what I need to do through this process.  Taking the risk of being told I’ll fail would be too painful.The result was 7.3.5 to 48.7.3 suggests that I do indeed have a battle going on.  I interpret to mean that I need to stop letting myself from being led by unrealistic musings/expectations both good and bad.  A big part of my plan is to stop worrying about outcomes, and to accept how things are. Truth is that no matter what the situation is, there are beautiful things all around.  But it’s so hard to look at the beautiful things when there is that one ugly thing (the corpse, I guess).  7.5 I have no idea what to make of this line.  I think it means to stay mindful and stick to a plan.  When I get overly emotional I lose my ability to reason.  I think this line may be a warning against giving in to that when difficulty arises.  How do you keep your head when something upsetting happens?  Deep breathing, remembering to count the beautiful things?48 seems to suggest that I have the resources, will, strength to do this but it won’t be easy.Let me know what you think."

1801,"Dear All,I have to apologise in advance for even asking about hex 61 after ALL that has been posted on it on this forum.But my question was not as deep and philosophical as the entire hex 61, yet I got it twice (all right, I sat on the answer, didn't get it and asked the same question again - slap on the wrist well deserved....).The question was: will this new suitor that has turned up in my life become my boyfriend/partner? Yes, fair enough it's the first time in about 5 months that I am daring to open my heart again and yes, it's all 61 stuff  - accept the possibility of being either delighted or hurt by another (lovely so far, but then who knows...?) human being. But what on earth is the IC telling me about this one - will it work out or not?Your suggestions/comments are gratefully awaited, as ever.:bows:"
1802,"Hello  all,Long story short, for the past year I've been discontent, dissatisfied, aimless, and probably a little too ungrateful for some of the things that I do have in my life while brooding over what I don't. I'm 22 and I have back issues which I've become desperate to correct, but I keep running into obstacles, whether mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, whatever. I want to move forth, but I'm unsure how.I just did a reading for how to let go of all of this:Hexagram 32.1.3.4.6 ==>41Line 6: It has come up a few times in the past year (32.6), and always when I am most desperate for change.

1803,"I have an extremely complicated relationship issue that im trying to navigate.  I feel as though i'm walking thru a mine field with no idea where the mines are.  I've asked some people for advice but no one has been in a situation like this that I know.  I was engaged to my ex and we broke it off 4 months ago. I have my own business and we worked together for 4yrs and were very successful.  When we worked together I tryed to show her how to be self sufficent, but you cant make a horse drink. Unfortunatley it started to break down earlier this year which led to the break up.  There are two type of people in the world the type who can learn from others mistakes and the type who wont listen and must go out and bump there head.  Shes the latter.  lol.  Anyway after the breakup I prayed that God would remove our obstacles which were standing in our way and I can say 4 months later he did.  So now shes starting to see the truth of some of the things I told her and an opportunity has come to her which I had been trying to get her to see for 4 yrs, so now she wants to work together again.  She still shows some reservation to come back to the relationship, but im going on faith that this will be removed as well.  I asked the question show me a picture of our relationship and where its going and i got a 46 L2, L5 & L6 changing to 53.  I think this means slow and steady.  I also asked will we get back together and I got a 42 L1, L3, L4 & L6 changing to 31.  My last question was where does she want our romantic relationship to go from here and I got 18.  What is God trying to get me to understand about this relationship with my ex i got  55 L1, L2, L3, L4 changing to 7.  Any help would be REALLY apreciated.Last edited: Dec 23, 2009"
1804,"How would you interpret 39.3 > 8 when asking what someones true intentions toward you are? That is the answer I can read it as generally saying that there is an obstruction to union, but how does line 3 play in? She feels that by going on with me it would lead to misfortune or that by doing what she is doing now and remaining just friends would lead to misfortune and we should instead try again?So for clarification I asked What must be done to overcome this obstruction to union?59.1 > 6159.1 is about taking some action now and not waiting, but to dissolve the mutual misunderstandings and mistrust....

1805,"Re: Meeting 5.1.3>29Hello everyone,I've been invited by a fellow student from university for an ""innocent"" coffee and I asked the I Ching about how the meeting should go, as I've accepted. I'm genuinely not interested (the man doth protest too much) in beginning a relationship with her, but she is pretty forward. I'm recently (2 years) divorced from a long marriage and I don't want to get into a new relationship right now. She is in a long-term relationship herself of 10 years. There is an a 15 year age discrepancy, which isn't really a problem, but I'm trying to avoid triangles, since my wife left me suddenly for someone else  and, well, it's easier to be with someone who is single! By the way, I've asked the I Ching about other such meetings with other women with triangular aspects before answering them, and they've given me ominous readings. This time, I asked after I'd already accepted.Anyhow, I asked the oracle and got 5.1.3> 29. What I like about the I Ching is that I get the most serious replies to fairly innocuous questions because, of course, they aren't really innocuous. In fact, I take it that the hexagrams are giving a warning about possible enmeshments that are not auspicious (5.3). I know that 29, from reading other threads, is not necessarily to be interpreted so much negatively as just danger. But, after a long preamble, how does one approach such a reading? Do I not meet her for coffee? That seems ridiculous. And yet, do we want to fall into the Abysmal? I've known her for 4 years and we've hung out on occasion and, though she is really attractive, I feel some trepidation. I don't know if any of you mix astrology and the I Ching ( a new syncretism!), but, for those who may, we have a great composite chart (which is the union of two natal charts to make one mind-blowing entity). So I'm tempted too!In the end, I take it that I should just be mindful that this meeting could lead me down a path where I need to protect myself, as Wilhelm has it, ""against attacks from without and against turmoil within."" And then chill out.Any thoughts?Thanks for considering this rambling query!"

1809,"Hi all, I just got this reading and I sort of have two opposing views. I am applying to medical school and have requested a letter of recommendation from my graduate advisor. Every return communication I have received in regard to the request has been positive if not somewhat enthusiastic. But I have not received the letter. Two deadlines have passed that I have emailed him about and the last one is coming 12/31. The last 3 emails I have sent have passed unanswered. He does tend to keep himself quite busy though. So in regard to this situation I asked the I Ching:Please show me an image of Dr. X's intention to write me a letter? 55.5.6 -> 1355.5 and the relating hexagram 13 sound good but I am worried about 55.6. I have been worried if my tone in subsequent e-mails was off-putting or non-productive. I cannot contact him by phone and another email seems out of the question. One submitted application is in jeopardy of not going through because his letter is missing past the deadline and Im wondering if I should go ahead and commit to his letter appearing for the remaining ones. Actually getting it and submitting it could be very beneficial since he is MD,Phd and a professor at a prominent medical school. Thanks very much for your help -- Best, Herrmyte   "
1810,"Dear all, I appreciate the time you take in reading this. I feel stuck with x. I put him out of my mind for good, it took so much out of me, till he came back and we started re-visiting the past. Of course I am part of the equation cos no one can consume my thoughts unless I allow them to...so it's not like I blame him. I feel it's to do with me.He's asked if I want to go on a trip with him, visit him etc... And i feel all these feelings coming back from my part at least. The best person to talk to would be him so I asked Yi:about asking x what he feels for me so that I can take a stand.12 (4.6) --> 8I usually take Hex 12 as stop! But lines 4 nd 6 seem positive. Can I take that good will come out of this, so i can go ahead and ask? Hex 8 is about coming together, can  I take it as he will have a chance to either come together or not?the outcome of asking x's feelings about me?35I looked at the Key Q's by Hillary and 35, Advancing asked ""What gifts and opportunities have you been given? How can you make the most of them?

1812,"Here is another take on Hex 44 that I haven't yet come accross on here.  This very different take on Hex 44 is taken from the Wilhelm-Baynes translation of “The I Ching or the Book of Changes”[/B]The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way. Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result."
1813,"Hi, everybody! What a great find! (this forum)I have consulted the I ching a few times in my life and felt a connection with it. Every few years I would consult. This changed recently. After 27 years of marraige, my wife decided it was time to move on. It gets complicated and not the main point here so I will spare you the fodder for that sad violin music. In dealing with this major change in my life and the effects of open heart surgery by chain saw, I have turned to the I ching on an average of a few times a week. It has been an incredible source for helping me widen my view of the situation, and most importantly a reminder that everything really is always changing so therefore embrace the future with creativity and openess. The future really is an wonderful unknown. We may see a direction things are headed, but only at this time. (Speaking for myself here with the preverbial ""we"") If I consult the oracle with a sincere heart felt question, the answer is usually pretty clear) If the question is right and clear, so is the hexagram.....So anyway, enough of me and on to my question.In the past 3 months I have thrown the coins about 2 dozen times when I feel a change in what was developing with my X an I, or within myself. Only 3 times I have asked specifically what is happening with my wife (what is going on within her). Twice the changing Hexagram was ""coming to meet"". Once I asked ""Where is she headed"" (in life). This question phrased in the context of the future, brought up ""Coming to meet"" as the primary hexagram. In each case I am really puzzled about the meaning, and feel it does not bode well for her due to the references to danger.So I am asking if maybe someone might have some insight into this hexagram, given the situation I have described. BTW she took the book so I am waiting for a new one in the mail. I like the Wihelm/Jung version. OH!, I really am a nice guy, she just needs to move on without me. Any ideas would be appreciatedThanksRon"

Interpretation of this is ver appreciated."
1815,"Hi everyone, my name is Jason. I'm a first year student of Chinese medicine and I started exploring the Yi just before I started my program a few months ago. I was at a lecture about fengshui and the speaker gave a brief intro to the bagua and the trigrams, and I'm not sure what happened, but I think it was love at first sight. Perhaps the delicious symmetry of Fuxi's arrangement simply tickled my OCD bone, but whatever the reason I had to know more.That brought me to this wonderful site which gave me everything I needed to hit the ground running with my own readings. Those were absolutely marvelous first encounters with the book of changes and I've been hooked ever since. I figured that I should start talking to this community if I want to go further.I have this feeling that my side study of the Yi will pay off big once I'm out there sticking pins in people. I had this flash a few weeks ago suggesting that diagnosis in Chinese medicine utilizes the same mind one requires for divination. You have to empty out and let the universe do all the talking, holding yourself back from grasping at what you think the answers are. I asked my teachers and they all suggested that the link was more or less valid. But I thought I'd ask Change too and see what that came up with. Here's what I got:""How is diagnosis like divination?""Primary: 13 - Tong Ren (Unity)Relating: 42 - Yi (Increase)I take this to mean that the similarities between the two are great, and that they share a common goal. Both are ways of navigating the wilderness of the unknown, the ripe not-yet, and being able to hear the message of the universe, whether it comes in the form of a response from the Yi or the meaning behind a patient's symptoms and patterns. They both bring clarity into one's interior and allow for bold and decisive action without - in divination, the power to take advantage of the situation and make a move with confidence and in diagnosis, an effective treatment.The 3rd and 4th moving lines speak to me about the integration of the diagnostic mind and the divinatory mind. The 3rd says it will take me a while to sort it out, perhaps 3 years (which might mean the 4th and last year of my program) and that perhaps I should be as attentive to differences as similarities, for the sake of my learning and for the sake of avoiding any potential pitfalls. The 4th line is moving through that point and coming to a homey, defensible position of integration, where I have spent my time becoming clear about diagnosis, and becoming clear about divination, each separately. The result is overflowing blessings. I feel doubly encouraged by both hexagrams responding ""advantageous to ford a great stream.""I'd like to hear what other folks think of this response so I can sharpen my interpretations. I look forward to chatting with you all in the future.Jason(If any of you hang out on twitter, I'm @allpraxis.)"
1816,Got 23 unchanging to this question. So obvious -- let go!! But HOW??
1817,A guy I dated about a month ago ( we stopped cuz he lives far away) left town and is coming back today. He emails me friendly notes about every 2 weeks.. I asked the Yi  what are the prospects of him calling me and seeing me when he is here... It looks promising to me based on abundance 55 and 49 means change radical...maybe he wants to start seeing me again???  What say you all you wise members???

On another note i'm financially independent and she is not.  I worked with this women for 4 yrs and attempted to get us into a situation where we could be self sufficient.  She didnt see the oppurtunity in front of her then, but now since we separated and shes having financial difficulty she wants to work together again now.

1820,"Hello again,I have a question for you. I am trying to find out what is what is happening to me in regards to a situation where I don't feel entirely good. It's like a little pressure in my heart that I still could not translate in my mind.

My question was ""what is what I feel about this situation"". In other posts I read about ""fear"" that is shown by 51. It is perhaps fear what I feel in my chest?

1823,"Please help me interpret the I ching response to this common question. I received hexagram 29 The Abysmal ( water) line five. Kan here repeated shows the possesion of sincerity, through which the mind is penetrating. Action in accordance with this will be of high value. The representation of water flowing on continuously form repeated Kan. The superior man in accordance with this maintains constantly the virtue of his heart and the integrity of his conduct, and practices the business of instruction.Line 5 Shows the water of the defile not yet full so that it might flow away, but order will soon be brought about. There will be no error. That sounds promising but I dont completely understand the message. If you can give me more insight, please share. I feel I am a sincere person and really want a serious loving relationship. I dont understand why it would be telling me I am lacking in virtue and sincerity. If I was the cheating kind or easily infatuated with several men then I would understand. I am also not controlling or manipulative. I think I am a good person but all I can think of if I have a tendency to be negative and get depressed. Maybe it is saying I need to work on whatever I am lacking and find happiness within myself to attract the right people. I have not had a relationship because I am not very sociable and the guys who have approached me dont seem to have serious relationship potential."

Changing line was the same too.Question is: What if I keep this child? (first time I asked a bit differently - Should I give up this child?)Very serious situation. I am 31 years old and 6 weeks pregnant, my partner doesn't want the child because of his bad psychological state (not crazy but seeing a therapist for a while now because of a problem he has with his family life- his father was unhappy all his life and he blames his mother for it so has mother complex with all that goes with it like problems with erection and reaching orgasm, obviously that's better now or I wouldn't be pregnant, he thinks this will slow his healing process or stop it all together). He want's me to have an abortion but I feel very strongly against it and will decide to do it only as a last option. (We are not even living together yet, both are in process of divorce, he has 2 children from previous marriage.)If I have this child I will be alone, I am prepared to do this but he and his therapist have scared me that a child without father can have serious issues, also if its a boy living only with women etc. I thought if the child had enough love from one parent that would be enough, but how can I be sure?The need to ask this question only came after talking to my partner. There are many bad circumstances here but when I found out I was pregnant I was scared but very happy, I thought everything will come together. I thought this was a good thing. Not sure any more...I will talk both to his therapist and the one I started to see and think about whats good and bad in this situation but I Ching always helps me in some way so I would like to better understand the meaning of this hexagram...it might be important because future is very vague for me right now.Thanks for reading all of this!"

1830,"Hi allI was wondering if you could help work something out. I met someone who I knew from way back but never developed a close relationship with. I was over to my home town last weekend and met him by chance in a bar. We spent the night together and when I got home we just ended up chatting online a lot.I am very thrilled about it all because I think we have a lot in common and that he likes me. But I just come out of a wrong relationship and I want to be more careful about what I do and who I fall for, if that's ever possible. In some way I think it is, it just a matter of cold awareness. We are very different in terms of background and education but very similar in a 'spiritual' way that is our values and what we look for in life.I asked a series of questions to try and work out what I should be doing about all this. I can see myself going into 'loved up' mode which I am very wary of because I need to really try to know what I need in a relationship and not to fall into the wrong one so to speak, which will not nourish me or my partner.So here it goesWhat should I do about J? 22.3.6 - 24 (I got 22 and 24 a lot lately relating to my old relationship and other stuff and can't quite work it out)Then I asked again what's my position within the situation? 25.4.5 - 27 (Here I am basically wondering if I'm interested for the right reasons or if it is just blind attachment to someone else or blind excitment about the newness of it all?What's his position within all of that? 46.4 - 32 (I think this means he likes me)What would a relationship together be like? 8.5 - 2Thanks in advance and over to you wizzards :bows:"
1831,"Hey all . . I recently consulted the I Ching about a topic that's NOT related to my ex husband!!  Haven't done that in a while!!To cut a long story short, I do TV work . . just bits and pieces here and there . . which of course means that I often meet people in the industry.  I did a show over a year ago and was told by one of the production team that the producer was ""very taken"" with me - which was lovely as he was definitely my type!!  Anyway, I thought no more of it until recently when the new show that he produces was highlighted on a TV program which I was watching . . I suddenly had an urge to see if he was on Facebook, which he was, so I sent a 'friend request' and a brief email attached.  i didn't even know if he would remember me as the last time I saw him was over a year ago!  He accepted my 'friend request' and he replied by email which said ""of course I remember you, I had quite a crush on you!"" - which I found extremely flattering.  This all started last Saturday and we have corresponded via email every day ever since!  His emails have been light and flirtatious which at first I read nothing into but now, almost a week on, I think to myself ""why on earth is he bothering!""  After all, I suspect he could have pretty much whoever he wants . .  he's good looking, charismatic, well respected in the industry and seems to be a really nice guy.  So . .  of course I consulted the i Ching during the last few days. The first few readings I got have definitely come to pass . .  for example one of the questions I asked was ""How likely is it that X will respond to my last email?"" and I got hex 19.1.2.3.4.5 changing to 31.  In my own personal experience, hex 19 with moving lines has ALWAYS meant that there would be movement in the area that I was asking about and sure enough I was bombarded with a number of emails from him later that day.  So - that one has already been taken care of . .  it's the readings below which I would really appreciate your help with. Huge apologies as there are a few!This morning I asked, ""What can I expect next with X?""Hex 27.2.3.4.6 changing to 34""How likely is it that X will ask me out?""Hex 17 unchanging""Why is X bothering to email me?""Hex 27 unchanging (Hex 27 again!!)""What are his intentions toward me?""Hex 61 unchanging.  I don't relate to the ""you know deep down"" interpretation of this - it has never been that way for me anyway.  So I took this to mean that his intentions were sincere?  I then asked the same question but in different format - I asked ""What does X want from me?"" and got hex 30 unchanging.  I have never liked hex 30 and was therefore disappointed to receive it.And finally . . i asked ""How attracted is X to me?"" Hex 42.2.3.4 to 1Ginnie, Trojan . .  either of you out there?Warmest Wishes Claire x x x"

I thought of sending a casual and friendly text about that. I feel that I have to be able to keep our communications (that are very sparse) ""relaxed"".So I asked the Yi:What do you think about sending a casual, light and funny text message to X?31.5 >62  Influence through small things.So straight-forward and simple.It made my day. I'm not asking anything else today.Last edited: Dec 17, 2009"
1834,I have started a new job and asked the yito give me some insight on how to do very well at this job and I got 42.3 to 37Does this mean to speak openly?
1835,"Please could anyone help me with this.  I last posted on here in June, and everyone was really helpful, and I acted on their advice about my relationship and left my partner.  However, things changed, or at least I thought they had, and we got back together and are now living together again.  At that time my partner had an on-line relationship with another woman.  He said it just a friendship, but it turned out not to be, even though they never met.  It's now all happening again and I'm being told the same stuff again, i.e - its just a friendship, although, again, I have my doubts.I don't want to stand in the way of their relationship, if its what's meant to be.  At the same time I want to do whatever's necessary to keep our four year relationship together.This morning, I asked the I Ching;Please show me an image of their relationship and where it's going.Hexagram 37 lines 1, 4, and 5  > Hexagram 56.I then asked;Please show me an image of our relationship and where its going.Hexagram 1 line 2 > Hexagram 13.Could anyone please help me interpret these as I need to know whether to move on, or to try and make this work.  I suppose I'm trying to ask, which is the right thing, for all of us?Thanks"
1836,"Helloam new and trying to understand Iching. I was wondering if you can give me some insight to a relationship I've had.Some background....I was in a relationship with a military man. His whole actions towards me confused me.He would be extremely interested in me, calling wanting to see me... then without any notice.. just stop calling me, and would not answer any of my calls.  He did this 3 different times.  We are now on the off stage.My question was     what happen between X and me. and got 18.3.Hmmm working on what soiled... Is there something am doing that is scaring him off ?Asked what is my role in X's distance towards me and got 58.1 Can you give me some insight pleaseHappy Holidays!"
1837,"Hi everyone,If you remember my past postings, my main concern lately is my separation (and possible divorce) from my husband. It was a rather unilateral decision, with lots of drama and heavy feelings. None of us acted appropriately, in my opinion, both out of fear.In any case, it's been over 3 months now since our last encounter face-to-face.Risking to sound pathetic, I still love him very much. Even he hasn't denied it or confirmed it, I know he is involved with someone else. The nature of the relationship is unknown to me. I know he can't be alone, but if this is for real or not, is unclear.I have of course (again, I'm ashamed to admit it) asked many times the Yi about them, with very, very confusing and contradictory answers. On my end, I still hold hopes. But they are based on the past. There's no hint or sign that he wants to get back together.Now, every time I'm about to let go, something surges within me. I can't explain well, I know that it could be delusional, but its like a little voice saying: ""don't give up"".Today, it should be our 3 year anniversary. I asked: ""Should I let go of him or not"". I know ""or"" questions are not that good, but being so many hexes that talk about getting rid/ changing and so many other talking about persevering, I though it could be easy to answer.I got 26.I'm reading this as: ""Don't let go, but hold your horses and don't try anything just yet. Prepare for the future"".I'm really desperate here. I don't seem to be able to move forward. I have friend's help, I'm meditating, going to therapy, praying, but nothing seems to give me peace of mind.Any suggestions will be welcomed.Thanks,Flor."
1838,"Hello - My roommate just died - it was horrible - as she was riding on her bicycle and got hit by a truck - We were just getting to know one another - and it is a shock - and I've never quite dealt with this before- I am being healthy and sharing my grief - but privately, I am being obsessive about things and super self critical - I asked the i ching to help me understand and move through this situation and my self- criticism - and received 20- 2 Please advise me if you can. thanks"
1839,"As a former professional (for lack of better term) athlete, and one who has been extremely physically active her entire life, not knowing less than 7 days of workouts per week for the past 35 yrs, movement is very important to me. One year ago I damaged a joint in my foot. It took over a year for it to heal and it seems to now be damaged again, but worse than the first time. I have been very cognizant of staying off of it - doing nothing but sleeping and sitting-- but am terribly frightened the damage is permanent now and will never heal -- or if it heals, it will become reinjured. Immobility to me is death. It takes all my willpower to NOT go to the gym and workout each day; it has caused a great depression in my spirit. To me there is no life without movement... and I'm dying inside, or so it feels.I asked the Yi to show me what is going on in the foot. It said 60.5 LImitation (!no suprise there) and then 19 Approach. I am not clear on the significance of ""approach"" here. Approaching...what?That changing line is Sweet limitation brings good fortune. Going brings esteem.Which seems to imply this injury and its pain (emotional, physical, psychological) is positive in some way. (?)I then asked what I can do about it. The Yi said 11.3 and again 19.Hex 11 is Peace (rest the foot) and line 3 says ""No plain not followed by a slope.No going not followed by a return. He who remains persevering in dangerIs without blame. Do not complain about this truth; Enjoy the good fortune you still possess."" which seems to be another ""look on the bright side"" issue, although frankly I do not see one... What if it doesn't heal? Not all injuries do..."
1840,"After four months I'm leaving my grandbaby Jax and flying back home Friday. My heart hurts so much I can hardly breathe.To make matters worse the I Ching line we'll be focusing on in the Memorization threads that day will be  62.1!I asked the I Ching what I should focus on to get through this and received 32. Duration, no change lines. I see this as meaning just keep on keeping on but that doesn't help much. Any words of encouragement?-rosada"
1841,"Hi Everyone, I had recently posted about a guy that i revealed my feelings to and never got a response. Well, lately there have been a few minor friendly interactions, basically just smile and hellos. I had tried to face the fact that if he never responded to me revealing my feelings it was obviously because he didnt feel the same way. But seeing him again made me feel in my gut what I have felt for awhile, that there is something there, something between and we should be giving it a try. This feeling has been with me for a long time and I don't understand how I can feel so strongly about this and he feels nothing. In frustration with my self i asked ""why do I still feel like there is something there and that we should be together doing something about it""the answer I got was 59.2 changing to 20I am honestly baffled and cannot even fathom what this means in reference to my question. As a guess maybe the dissolution is me realizing he does not like me, putting myself out there and now all hopes of being together being dissolved, but I don't understand how this can explain why I still feel the way I doMaybe I am having a hard time interpreting the reading because I feel so sad inside about the situation, any thoughts on what this may mean would be greatly appreciated "
1842,"Hi, I need help in trying to understand some of my feelings. About a year and half ago.. I met someone. Our first meet, I went home , my best friend called to ask about how my date went.. surprizing myself, I said I just met the guy am going to marry.  It was just a matter of fact feeling. I have never in my life ever said that about any other man. Or felt it. Your might say.. I tend to take relationships very, very slow. well, fast forward to now.  No we did not marry. He drove me nuts with his wishy washyness. So I basically just let the relationship die. I have not seen him for 6 months.But for some reason, my feelings haunt me... I still feel that he is the man I will marry . It's like I know.  Its just a matter of fact.  Hard to explain the feeling.Anyway.. I recieved 49.5"
1843,"I just tossed regarding what I can do to pull out of the downward spiral I've been on for far too long...I'm reaching a point where I can hardly tolerate my own darned selfIC's response: 53 unchanging.

1845,"Hello,I have started taking antidepressants and aside from 3 or 4 days of side effects (minor) I have felt excellent - no sinking feelings, no hopelessness, no self hatred, no mistrust of others - feeling more confident and expansive.BUT today spoke to a very old and dependable childhood friend on the phone - we have become closer since moving home but we are very different (kind of like sisters when little). She is a mental health nurse.I had a feeling, a thought that I wouldn't tell her I was on anti-depressants, because even though I know she's the first person who'd want to help and listen I didn't want to become her patient at all... I also know that the lives of people she helps on a daily basis are so traumatic - that she maybe finds it harder to understand friends resorting to them. I sensed a reserve when I told her - scepticism - which I was expecting so wasn't going to tell her, but the subject came up and it popped out. Just thought its best to be open and honest (get that from my dad) - still haven't learnt that some things, from certain people, should be kept quiet.I felt like I was defending myself to her, digging a hole in the process. And felt a horrible sinking feeling I haven't had for a while. And now I'm worrying about it. That the relation will be changed. I think it's not good to be so open about weaknesses with certain people. She has a heart of gold but I just feel really uncomfortable about it. I'm seeing her tomorrow and slightly dreading it. The relationship feels strained and my readings reflect this suspicion. I first asked for help with my awful feelings of catastrophe over something that perhaps is minor and can be moved past.28. 4 > 47Oh dear.Should I not have told her?33.1,3,5 > 21Seems not - an inappropriate topic to broach with her (irony being she's a mental health nurse) and 21 - a bone of contention (certainly feels that way - I actually felt like I wanted to hang up on her!)How to proceed with her?28.3,4 > 29Oh dear... Does it perhaps mean that this is dangerous ground as on such topics we are not on the same wavelength? But how to proceed along a sagging ridge pole?Would very much appreciate help with this. I also thought to myself I shouldn't tell to many people about being on them - except family - because apart from anything else, in my silly head I may be over thinking them and thus they'd lose their effect! If I make too big a deal out of them. Rather than them just being a way to re-balance - which I tried to explain to her, but I felt unconvincingly. Maybe it's also partly due to my tendency to see all sides to everything - and so to doubt my own standpoint.Argh:bows:Last edited: Dec 13, 2009"
1846,"Hello,I am hoping you could give me a hand with these readings. It's about a relationship that seems to be fated in my life, although it seems it comes with turbulence rather than violins...

At first I thought he wanted to have me closer in his life, but now I am not really sure about why he invited me -I mean, he does not seem to have any particular interest in me, besides what we share in this group.

1849,"I am in the process of making a major life change. I really believe and think and feel that I need to separate myself from my partner. Of course, self-doubt creeps up every now and again and I wonder if I am being impulsive, if something is clouding my judgment.  I am also contemplating moving away next fall, to a new city. I'm scared to do this, but at the same time I want to get a fresh start, a second chance, but I am afraid. I had a really bad day one day this week but I meditated and prayed and searched and found meaning, this made the whole day worthwhile. For the first time in my quarter of a century life I am believing that little voice in my head, I'm paying attention, listening to her and all.  But still, I am scared of making a bad choice. I just want to make the right choices, I just want to be happy. So I asked last night, What do I need to be happy? And I got hex 55, with the second line moving, changing to 34.  I felt as though I was the sun at noon... as if I need to trust myself and my little inner voice, this is as good as it gets, the rest is up to me. What do you guys think?"

""How will obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Software Development impact my life?"" The answer I received was 51.4.6 > 27...Am I reading this wrong??! Because it doesn't look very encouraging to me.

Interesting coincidence or some type of premonition..I don't know!  However, I was still taken aback at the contact, as our last communication was over 6 months ago when it seemed we pretty much decided to say our last (and final) goodbyes.  So imagine my surprise when he sends me a message last evening...after having thought a great deal about him just that day!??!After being invited, I visited with him for a bit and it was nice...very nice to see him...I enjoy his time and attention immensely!!!And of course now, true to my form, I'm questioning the whole exchange and what it means..what possibilities lie ahead...etc, etc,,,Asked IC whats going on with this sudden contact and received  22.5.6 -->63The people here always help to clarify things and take out the subjective viewpoint that clouds my ability to hear and comprehend IC's messages clearly.

1855,"Hello everyone,I asked what the outlook was for attending for a graduate program at a university next year and received the reading in the title. This university is in another country, America, and is very ""prestigious."" I put that in quotation marks, because I'm not really interested in its prestige, as much as a place that I would feel comfortable at. Often high-ranked places are rife with tension, big egos and politicking. Of course, there are also many benefits too. Is 40 telling me that I can get let go of the tension about it?I wouldn't have thought of applying to this place, but I visited a professor in America this week who strongly suggested that I apply there.I realize there is another Shared Reading of the same sequence, but I thought I would ask all the same. I realize that 50.3 is mildly negative and 50.6 very positive, but I'm wondering about Deliverance. I often get Deliverance, and find that ""the southwest furthers"" can be taken literally. However, in this case the university is in the south-east! Am I being too literal-minded here? Also, I think I understand the general outlines of 40, but does anyone have an idea about the ""pardoning of mistakes."" Could it mean I pardon my own (thinking this place is a little too grand for me or that I am not adequately prepared for it?)Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thank you for considering this request.Yours,P"

It is clear to me that my boss is totally over with whatever we had, so the problem is only with myself.

My question was ""will they ask me to work more days with them?""Is it possible that the I Ching is telling me that at the moment it will not happen but later will happen for sure?

A piece of work went wrong due to bad communication and different values between the three partners, one has decided to withdraw and follow her own interests (which we have decided is the best way to maintain the friendship, she let me down really badly by not delivering, and I probably didn't handle it too well) and the other one is busy considering how and if we can continue to work together. I'm feeling exhausted and upset by difficult feedback from the client, and arguments over how to proceed, even though I have enough independent work and clients to work independently right now.

1861,"Hi everyone!I've been reading posts on this site for some time now and I've really appreciated the new interpretation that everyone has given to my own self reading.However, I think I need some further clarity. My brother, youngest brother, has for some time been the cause of pain  as he is deliberately rude, mean and holding grudges for the mildest of slights. He is determined to shut the family out of his life. I ask the I ching, ""How should I behave towards my brother"" and I got 40 Deliverance, with changing lines .2.4.6, and the hexigram changing to 23 splitting apart. So there is a major issue with forgiveness, that I should forgive the intentional or unintentional mistakes and give myself clarity. Continue with the task of trying to include my brother in family events (which he agrees to come to and then refuses to at the last min) and slow progress inches ahead... however the hexagram splitting apart.My own sister confided in me that she fears when our mother dies (years in the future!) our brother will pass out of her life...

1867,"Hi all,I wonder if you can help me with a reading.It’s the 3d week I suffer from severe headaches. I assume its because I’m in the middle of very stressful times  in many areas of my life and that perhaps is the cause of the headache. I’m really tired emotionally and physically but there are responsibilities that don’t give me the luxury to back off and rest for a while. I have talk with someone knows me well and he told me that what he sees is that I push myself to do more that I can do right now and that I don’t allow myself to relax. Anyway, I asked Yi, to have some information and put in an order my thoughts. The question was “ what do I need to know about the headaches” got 40.4,6 > 4. ( note about 4, I have asked once so its not about asking many questions)I have make some thoughts re lines 4 and 6 but I can’t understand at all hex 4 here. How would you read this lines ?

1868,"There’s something about writing on the Yijing - it’s not like other books, that just sit there mutely and allow themselves to be translated. I think people who’ve worked through the hexagram-by-hexagram threads over the years have had similar experiences, as the line of the day just happens to show up in their experience.There was the time I was dithering over the name of Hexagram 8, and asked Yi about maybe changing it from the name I’d been using for years. Yi said 8, unchanging.There was the time I had to stop working and go out just as I was trying to get a sense of the essence of 31.1, ‘Influence in your big toes.’ So I left my desk - reluctantly! - and got ready, and then I had a few minutes of hovering and pacing around the hall, ready to go, with nothing to do but wait for my husband. I caught myself thinking,‘Come on - while I’m waiting for you I could be getting into the experience of 31 line 1.’…chortle…And there was the evening meal where I was just about to start raving happily about the beauties of 61.2 to my (blessedly tolerant) husband when he suddenly pushed his wine glass towards me saying, ‘This is really good, you should try it.’And - not quite the same thing, but still creating that sense of being altogether out of my depth here - the other day, I was finishing working through the sample readings I’d gathered for Hexagram 64, line 6 - and finding myself so caught up in imagining what it’d be like to have finished (sleep featured heavily) that it was incredibly hard to concentrate - and found that the very last example on the (very last) page of notes was a reading about someone working on a book.Who’s writing whom here, anyway?"

He is having a hell of a time getting it to pass,he keeps telling me everyday for a 3-4 days it will be ready which I tell her and then it is not.The iching has been telling me all thru this that it's the cars fault for having the light on for such a lenght of time.Meanwhile she made plans to go somewhere tomorrow but we don't have the car back and she wants to know if she should take a bus. Which will add to expenses spend money she doesn't really have.And I was going to go bring her the car and had plans of my own in her city.I asked will i get car tomorrow 29.5-7This I took as a yes finally, I have had the car with the guy for two weeks and this is the closest yes I have gotten.I think it says Don't expect to make good on your plans at least you are getting the car.What should I tell her33.2-44Not sure what this means. She just called and was very upset about her plans going up in smoke. I told her I didn't know what she should do, but that I thought I would get the car sometime tomorrow.SHe asked how I knew that and the only way I knew that is through the i ching so I said I don't know how I know. Basically I let her get mad at me, even though I am in the middle and am more put out by this then she is cause I wait everyday the mechanic tells me he will bring me the car. Blah.Shoud she take bus to NYC tomorrow?34.3.4.6-41line 3-empty display of power-d/n go by busline 4 from Lise says  9 at 4: Determination     auspicious.    Regrets disappear. The fence breaks open, no entanglement. The vigor of a big cart's axle.Sparingly used power brings the greatest results. Forcing a matter will mess up things and waste forces. Use whatever possibility presents itself, use levers, pull strings, get a hammer instead of using your fist. There are many ways of making a big power from a little force.Now this corresponds to the situation with the car because the mechanic locks his gate every night and the car is (in his garage) behind that fence.line 6 Lise says: One has to measure one’s strength, control one's courage or self-will, judge a position. Hardship is necessary to build up character.I think this is about her having to judge the situation for herself without my help.leading to decrease which I can read either way. Decrease hope that the car is coming in time or go spend the money on the busWilhelm 41: There is no need of presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heart can be expressed.She wants to go to her friends birthday party so just cause she can't get there in a car she should still go or he knows she wants to be thereThus the superior man controls his angerAnd restrains his instincts.She was definitely angry , her instincts seemed to be saying take the bus. I think she shouldn't take the bus and wait and I will bring the car and it will be later than they wanted to leave but whatever...or maybe they shouldn't go to NY at all.Well if anyone can help I would appreciate.But I will know tomorrow what the reality is of the 29-7 reading and let you know.I guess this is for my peace of mind cause i can't tell her I got my info from an i ching reading so whatever..."
1870,"dear all,there's been an issue I've been mulling over recently and I'd like to hear your thoughts on . . maybe get some understanding . .this is how it goes: last week I had some friends coming over for dinner . . the occasion was a special one since it was on the day that one of my friends' mother would be celebrating her name were she still among us (my friend was very close to her and wants to do sth special every year on this day in her honor).We had a great time during dinner (there were 4 of us) and come desert, my friends proposed we each ask Yi a question. Two of them had already asked me at other times and I had offered them my help in how to do the toss and then we went thru a couple of good translations for their answers (me never knowing their question). I wasn't sure if this was a good idea but went along. Each of them threw the coins (without revealing their questions) and I offered what little I know, warning them that the answer is always theirs to find and that the best way is to read on their hexs . . still the moment was not right for taking out books and pc and reading so I emailed them the txts later . . What got me really upset was the answer I got when my turn came up . . what I thought I should ask was 'how was I doing in giving them my understanding of their answers' to which I got 62.6 . .:bag: . . after that I refrained from saying more even though my friends wanting to go a second round at this . .the next day I sat down discussing with Yi about this . .-first question was 'how did I do overall' 38.2 to 21 (that was perfectly ok with me since it is the same answer I got when I once asked Yi how are questions related to their answers . . )then I got to the details and I asked 'how did i do on the 1st answer (an unchanging hex)-15.4 to 62how did I do on the 2nd (a 1 chang. line reading and one thrown by the friend whose mother was in honor)?-16.4 to 2how about the 3rd? (a 3 chang. lines reading and the person who threw this is a very good friend of my friends but not more of an acquaintance to me)-61.1,3,5,6 to 46last question: please explain further my answer . .-42.1 to 20 . .ooookaaay . . so I'm wondering about a couple of things:1) how do you see 62.6 in this context? I'm thinking two things here: either that the answer spoke about the last part of the 3rd answer where I seem to have gone off course, or that the answer warned me to not try to see this from a vantage point but stay grounded in the moment . . there's of course a chance that somehow it speaks of the occasion of our gathering (although that would not be answering my question as such)2)how do you see 42.1 in relation to 62.6? these seem to be very different in quality and sense . .3) in a strange way, the answers I got when asking further feedback from Yi seem to reflect how my friends took to my comments . . -the first, 15.4, this is a friend who is very pragmatic and realistic about life, very conscientious too . .-the second, 16.4, this is a composer, so 16's musical theme fits her nicely . .-the 3rd, 61.1,3,5,6, this is someone who had heard of the Yi but had not asked before (as far as I know) . . very sociable but quite private tooI would really appreciate your feedback on this . . i don't want to mislead my friends and this is sth that I'll agree to extremely rarely . . but 62.6 and 61.6 were really alarming to me . .p.s.: my last q abt this was: did i do the best thing by denying any more questions: 28.5 to 32 which i read as 'you felt overwhelmed so did what needed to be done in order to keep your head straight'any ideas??:bows:"
1871,"Wondering if I can get some input with a question I asked regarding my taiji practice.I've been having problems w/ my knees lately, which isn't uncommon w/ Chen style.  But, I've hit a crossroads where I know I have to do something different if I want to continue to practice and not cause further injury.  I've been told before that i have been going too low with my stance and I hadn't really taken that to heart for some reason or another.  I wish I would have paid more attention to this and raised my stance as my knees do feel better when I do.  however, there are many, many requirments for parts of the body such that I overlooked stance heigth as being a source of my pain and instead attributed the knee pain to other aspects of my structure.  I've been going through a process of narrowing down the shortcomings in my structure.  Taiji is very filling nourishment for me which is why I want to do it correct for a long time to come.   I'd like to gain some insight during this time of reassesment and I have been asking questions of Yi about other parts of my structure and how they are related to pain.So, I asked ""What is your input in regards to the heigth of my stance being the source of my knee pain and instability?""64.1>3864.1 makes sense as I have been told to not go so low before.  But is it the main source?I haven't had any experience with hex 38 and I don't clearly see how it applies in this situation.  :bows:"
1872,"Here's the situation. There is a girl I've been seeing that I would like to continue seeing, but things are up in the air right now. I asked ""what is the situation between M and myself and received hex 43"". I think this might be referring to my indecision about how to proceed, but I could be wrong. It could also be about her trying to decide between me and someone else. The part I'm not getting is in asking How can I resolve the situation between M and myself? I had asked this same question last week and received the same answer. Hex 64.2.5.6 > 45I really, really can't comprehend what this is telling me... Any insight would be greatly appreciated.Thanks "
1873,"Hello everyone!                       Its my best buds birthday coming up on friday. I got him a Wii Game because he loves playing on the wii with his friends. I asked the Yi if it was the right gift, I'm worrying he's already got it or if I should have got him something more unique or unusual. I'm seeing him tommorow so I might keep it in my bag and have a look at his games to make sure he hasn't got it before I give it to him  Or I could just give it to him and tell if its no good or he's got it I can exchange it, so its not a big dilemma, just me being a worry wort. :bows: He's not expecting anything from me tommorow so its sort of a suprise.Should I give him this present?46.4.5--28Pushing upward into excess. Hmm does this mean its too excessive, it was an expensive game but not in the context as we've been friends a long time and I've bought him more expensive and unusual ones. Or perhaps it means he will be overwhelmed.Line 4- the king offers him mount ch'i (or could that be Mount Wii ) good fortune, no blame. I'm taking this as its a good gift? I'd be chuffed to bits if someone gave me it.Line 5- Pushing upward by steps. Not sure about this line. I left a small note inside the box thanking him for being my best friend and for all the good times we've had. We play on the wii togther when I go over.Will he enjoy the gift?54.5---58This line I'm stumped over. The relating hex is 58 which I've experienced as joy before and as an exhange.Any thoughts would be very helpful! I'll give an update later Thanks "
1874,"I had a 'strange' experience with the YI recently. A couple of day's ago I did a consult and got 11.1.6. to 18. Yesterday I did a new consult and got again 11.1.6  I was asking a question concerning social relations and introversion in the first consult. In the consult yesterday I was asking, accordingly the advice from Hilary in her course, 'wath do I have to know'. I know I was internal again concerned with the same matter as a couple of days ago. So I was very amazed getting the same answer. I understand the Gua and the particulary lines, buth can't see how the comments of 1 and 6 understand together. Is it to understand as 'if you don't do 1 you get 6? What line is dominant? What is the connection?  Should appreciate some help. Thanks."
1875,"A month go I met a person and I felt a connection, I asked the IChing what kind of connection was there and I got  56 changing to 12 and I thought to understand that was something dark there for me, but it was interpreted  for me like this:12.3,5 > 56 Now this isn't so bad as it seems, as it seems that you do have a chance with this new guy, so your days of being a single and feeling down are hopefully coming to an end. Of course nothing will happen without a bit of push from you, and the belief that you will indeed succeed. So be strong and make those necessary changes in your life that will lead to a new relationship, do not despair, just be optimistic and go for it.But after a month, broke my possibilities to connect  with that person, before starting it, because even if I have felt intuitively connected to him at heart level, he is in a relationship, I did not know it, he said it to me  and also he said he wants to have a relationship with me but without leaving the other person..:0 kind of selfish no? I just feel that connection  very strong and I know is mutual, I asked again what is there, I want to understand and I got: 2.1 > 24Help interpreting is appreciate it, I just cant learn to read the Iching, it seems I interpret everything wrong, I am feeling frustrated about it"
1876,"Hello,This is a medical question so I understand if there are reservations in giving direct interpretation, but I have started taking anti-depressants (after one too many pot-holes, and feeling locked in around people). It has only been 3 days but I do feel weird - bit hyper, fearful, disturbed sleep, groggy - but then I've read that this is just your body re-adjusting and it'll settle down - and they'll do their job ie. give you your bounce back.Thing is they have a different effect on different people.I asked 'Should I keep taking them?'40.4,5,6 > 59... kind of suggests I should liberate myself from anything I could be dependant on (40.4) and the high inferior - the hawk on the wall is the pills? OR the inferior 'hardened in his wickedness' could be the depressive and negative thoughts I have inside that I can't see changing, unless I change.And 59 suggests dissolving something - I wonder if it means the anti-depressants will loosen up the hardness inside me that has become used to feeling bad? I should probably give them more time, but what with reading about the side-effects... and feeling a bit funny..Would really appreciate impressions here. I suppose as I said 'should I keep taking them' rather than 'should I stop taking them' might have a bearing... Maybe it's saying the medication will liberate me by melting the ice (ie. my depressive state) or then again.. does say not to be dependent...:bows:"

1878,"Hello all, I asked the I Ching the question ""When?"" and I got Hex 5 (2, 3, 5) changing to 24. According to the first Hexagram the time would be February, but I don't know how the second hexagram affects this interpretation. Can anyone help me please? Thanks a million,"
1879,"I thought I would post this reading here, because (for me and maybe for others) it will be a good learning reading.  I went to an interview today and came away not really knowing what impression I created. There's no doubt in my mind that I could do the job, but what I was wondering was - had I come across as too confident? If I had, then this would not be the organisation for me, so I'm not asking anything about what the outcome is likely to be.I asked What impression did I create at the interview?And got 49  3  5    51Hmm, I made quite an impression, didn't I? I'm not quite certain if line 3 is positive or negative in this situation - ‘Setting out to bring order means pitfall,Constancy means danger.Words of radical change draw near three times,There is truth and confidence.’I like the 'truth and confidence' - and indeed talked a lot about truth and sincerity in the interview because the job is about communication within an organisation. But what about the 'constancy means danger', and 'setting out to bring order means pitfall'? It's one of those Yi lines that seem to go two ways at once to me.Does anyone here have experience of this line? I will hear whether or not I have a second interview on Monday, so it will be interesting to see what the outcome is in the light of this reading."

1886,"Hello all,I'm interested in pursuing a business project for which I need partners. In the past, I did some business with a person and though it was profitable, we had our differences. That venture ended with a bit of frustation on both ends.As I was saying, I have a new idea now. I was looking forward to work with this person, because there's a lot to value (commitment, skills, ect.). We' ve discussed the issues we had in the past and I have presented the new project. Basically, there's nothing more I can do on my end. I just have to wait for the reply, the ball in on the other court.I must say, it doesn't look good. All signals point at a possible ""thanks but no thanks"". However, I have a feeling that this person is exactly what I need for the project, and that having it on board will be success, and - despite all signals- I think a ""yes"" could come.I asked:Will X accept to join this project?61.1.6 > 4 /// EDIT: right answer is 61.1.5 >4To me, I could be read two ways:1) Your feeling is right, you can influence others (my possible partner) with your truth, keep persevering (61). A new experience will be successful and educating (4)2) Stop asking (4), you already know the truth (61).a) the ""truth"" has to do with my feelings and faith ""against all odds""b) the ""truth"" is that they will say no, and I'm just deluding myself.What do you think?Cheers,FlorenciaLast edited: Dec 4, 2009"
1887,"Here's another relationship post - maybe someone has some input? I got in touch with someone recently - I left a message, and let them know I'd be back in touch, but haven't. I thought - if he's interested, he'll be in touch. If it was me, I would. He hasn't.  So, I asked: He hasn't been in touch - can you help me understand his perspective. I got this - 51 changing to 24. I don't really understand this. Especially, since I asked a follow up question: Can I, should I do anything to strenghten this relationship? And received: 28 - 44. There were some negative things in the past, some attraction, and I've initiated a more positive relationship (prior to this call). I feel: wrong about asking his perspective. Not so great about being in touch again, and just wanted to be grounded. Thanks for any advice."

Basically dextrose injections to stimulate further healing as ligaments that become lax ususally don't tighten up, which leads to instability.At any rate, the therapy sessions are too expensive so i can't continue to visit the MD for them and i feel I can perform the injections myself w/ my medical and anatomy education and seeing that i have access to all supplies.So I asked ""what will be the outcome if I self administer prolotherapy on myself?""I got 51.4 > 24.""the shock is mired""At first this seemed to be indicating that the time or situation is not best to do such a thing.  but, looking at it a  different way, w/ the shock being the injury and the mired feeling being the watery or lax ligaments, is the 51.4 describing the present situation?any input would be much appreciated!"

He hasn't responded yet and that's okay but while I wait to see what happens next, I did ask a few questions...I asked how is feeling about what I wrote? 31.2.4-->48I looked at this is he is unsure what to think of it or that he is unmoved by it in anyway? also, How will what I wrote effect things between us? 26.6--->11this seems to confirm to me that opening up about what I felt was the right thing to do and it will resolve any doubts he may have had about me. Looks to be a good omen, i thinkI also asked ""what are his intentions towards me now that he knows how i feel?"" 28.2--->31.  This again looks like a good omen, but have not heard anything back yet...Please show a picture of what is happening between us now? 45.2.3.4--->48this reading is the one that gave me the most trouble since it gave contradicting lines.

1895,"I asked the Yi a couple of questions reguarding someone very special to me. First: How does M feel about me? 37.4 > 13I'm the treasure of the house?!?! It certainly doesn't feel that way right now. Although I'm no mind reader and my knowledge of how to interpret the Hexagrams is minimal, so I suppose that could be what it's saying and I'm just being cynical.Second: What possibility is there of me ever being in a serious relationship with M? 11.1.4.5 > 28I'm stumped on this one.

1898,"Hello everybody,I hope -as usual- that you can help me to understand these readings. I am going through a lot lately in matters of relationships. Almost two months ago I started working with someone which who I had a an intimate relationship before. The fact that we starting working together changed our situation completely because this is how it was supposed to be, and now he is my boss. It has been difficult to me to let go of my yearning for more of what we had, and it has been some tension between us as well -we had a fight in disproportionate levels at one point. After that fight, things are getting better, like a new start in our relationship. A very cautious start.I really don't have a clue of what is going on in his mind about me, neither I know if he knows that I feel something strong about him. I know I am doing my best, I don't flirt, I try to keep it cool, but well, ... in our job there is a lot of physical contact where and, when he touches me, I just melt away. Then I go home and want to cry because I miss our time together. Today is one of those days. I am trying to find out what is best, what is what I can achieve in my current state to feel better, to know what the best attitude should be, to know how I can best deal with this situation. So I asked:Please give me a diagnosis of the relationship him/me: 51.1.3.5 to 31I feel like in a dead end with my yearning for him. What can I do about it? 39.3.6 to 20.What is the best way to interact with him when we are together? 3.1.3.6 to 53Well, I really hope you can help me with this. I am in ""neeeeeeeed""  of finding a way... Sometimes I feel my heart could explode. I really love my job, I love being with him and everybody at work.

I received 7-->46 (change line 3).Now generally my view is this; I'm going be a leader in the area I'm looking into & grow continuously shedding negative emotions, ego- and basically cultivating myself.However with that said...I've been slacking in my studies/training lately & getting distracted and I think the Yijing is saying ""get your act together"". Its a full daily commitment or nothing and stop being swayed by ""convenience"".Like some views, sincerely Zac."
1900,"Hi Everyone I'm new to the I Ching and was hoping for some help in a reading.Me and a love interest who I dated a couple of times have been estranged for 6 months now even though there was a strong attraction on both sides.  Something happened recently where he saw me and I'm just wondering if there is any hope of us starting up again or has he forgotten me completely. I asked the following questions:What was the hidden motives behind X's actions to want to end it.HEXAGRAM 18 LINE 6 CHANGES INTO HEXAGRAM 46(Does this mean that he only saw it as a temporary or casual affair?)Will X want to start up with me again?HEXAGRAM 57 LINES 2 AND 3 CHANGES INTO HEXAGRAM 20Can you please give me a date as to when X is thinking of contacting me if at all?(I've never asked a specific date and I'm wondering if it works)HEXAGRAM 59 LINES 3,4 AND 5 CHANGES INTO HEXAGRAM 50Will X make an effort to meet me halfway and end the impasse between us ?HEXAGRAM 48 LINES 4 AND 6 CHANGES INTO HEXAGRAM 44 What are X feelings for me at present?HEXAGRAM 51 LINE 1 CHANGES INTO HEXAGRAM 16Does anyone see hope of a reconnection between us? I can't call it a reconciliation or reunion as we only dated a couple of times nothing serious only a great beginning with a strong attraction that went all wrong.I really appreciate any help thanks!

1901,"Suppose you are casting coins on a table and one of the coins falls off. It was about to settle on heads before it fell, but landed on the floor as tails. Which would you count it as? Heads or tails?"
1902,"I've been seeing someone and today I asked what role I play in X's life.I recieved hex 49 lines 3, 5, and 6 changing to 21. I know 49 is about change, but I'm having a difficult time figuring out if that change is positive or negative. I know this girl just got out of a relationship in July and she was still healing when I met her so maybe my role was in allowing her to throw out the old relationship and move on to a new one. But it seems to be giving me advice rather than telling me what I did for her. I could also see it saying that I'M the old skin being shed by her and we should move on to something new. I dunno. Other opinions would be greatly appreciated."
1903,"Hi,I have a quick question for the experts. Sometimes, a line indicates that you can either act the right way or the wrong way. It tells you which action will bring fortune and which action will bring misfortune. From a personal perspective, it's relatively easy. However, when it relates to someone else's actions, I find it harder to read. Here's an example which I think really demonstrates my point:Hexagram 58, line 4: ""Often a man finds himself weighing the choice between various kinds of pleasures, and so long as he has not decided which kind he will choose, the higher or the lower, he has no inner peace. Only when he clearly recognizes that passion brings suffering, can he make up his mind to turn away from the lower pleasures and to strive for the higher. Once this decision is sealed, he finds true joy and peace, and inner conflict is overcome.""The person here needs to make a choice, either right or wrong. It doesn't specifically states that the right or wrong action is going to be taken. It just states that a choice needs to be made. If the question implies my own actions, it's easy. But what if the question implies someone else's actions? How can I know that this person's going to do either the right action or the wrong action? Can you see this with the second hexagram? Does the second hexagram give insight on the other person's possible actions since it talks about the outcome?I'm trying to improve my reading and to learn where I make mistakes. I still have problems when it comes to that issue. Maybe that's not the type of questions I should ask? If you guys could give me your point of view on that, I would really appreciated. :bows:"
1904,"I received the strangest random message a few weeks ago!  A literal stranger approached me and said, ""Honey, it's going to be two weeks for what you've been anxiously awaiting for some time now.""  I was taken aback of course  A I'm unaware of anything that I'm waiting for, much less anxiously...lol...I asked him what it was I was waiting for and the response was ""How would I know...it's your life...""  This seemed an odd exchange, but I gave it notice and waited to see what it might be about...  The 2 week mark he mentioned was yesterday and nothing of any major note occurred as yet.  So I asked the IC what that random message was about.Response: 19.3.6 -->26This seems a fairly nice reading, but I'm getting no hints as to the message in relation to my question.  I admit I can be rather ignorant and blind to these things though, as my intuition sense has faded out a great deal latelyAny thoughts?"
1905,"A short time ago, I had asked what would I have to do to achieve a career that is a dream I've been working towards and really understand that answer.  But I wanted to know what the current situation involving this career for me was at present.  The reply was hexagram 12, line 5 changing into hexagram 35.  I think that this is telling me that everything has been pretty much stagnant for me to this point but that things are changing for the better. I would like to hear others' thoughts on my interpretation.  Thanks. "

1911,"Hello,I finally feel that I am coming to the end of the road regarding a friend, who is no more. The hope is going, although still a remnant of feeling or I wouldn't be posting these readings for help. This is a long standing issue involving the same guy. I have tried to make it up, but I think he probably knows now that I have feelings for him, which is why it has ground to a halt. I have been here before of course - so convinced that no one else could fill those particular shoes and a part of you is gone forever - then lo and behold you wake up and the longing, or belief in that person, is gone. Only to be replaced, hopefully by someone more appropriate  I think knowing him has made me a better person, and that which does not kill me...so perhaps we go through these heart-breaks to be better equipped when the right person, at the right time, comes along.I asked the I ching - Is this the enduring status of this affair (not speaking)?40 DeliveranceI think it is saying I need to try and free myself from the disappointment of this reality... deliver myself from expecation, but also from despair (which today replaced inkling of hope)I asked then, is my interpretation of Deliverance (as in moving on) correct?46.1,2,3,5 > 3I like both these hexes. I see them as pushing upwards - growing and maturing - not being able to see where you're going - and like a shoot coming up through the surface of the earth - no longer having security around you (the soil) but having to have faith and going it alone - which is a difficult adjustment, in the beginning...Finally - He is not on my road?(He really did inspire me a lot - and I often thought of things and wanted to share them with him etc etc. but that enthusiasm is gone sadly - which is why I feel malnourished in that sense. And I think if I hadn't let my feelings run away with me - there may have still been a friendship - but maybe it could only go this way, complete estrangement- because friendship is based on equality - equal interest in each other, as well as other aspects...)54.2,3,6 > 30 To me this says, that I was never in control, could never get my own way here. Would always be secondary to his other affairs. Read somewhere else that hex 30 reflects individuals remaining separate? But also perhaps igniting something in each other? But I suppose anyone who makes you feel unworthy, should not continue being adored  But you can't help I suppose, who you see... or think you see, if you know what I mean.I suppose I just need to wait for someone more sincere... and remind myself that I don't have to be less bright, without his presence in my life...Any comments here would be much appreciated. I suppose it all speaks for itself?:bows:Last edited: Nov 26, 2009"

I am always concerned about receiving 54 as I read it to be in a subordinate position. My take on this reading is: there is someone I am subordinate to, but that not all is lost Hex 40 is about Liberation. Should I just set him free and painfully move on? Oh love and all of it's complicated manifestations...!Is it possible it reflects the subordinate position I am in with him at work?Last edited: Mar 12, 2008"
1913,"hello allI have  consulted the Iching regarding an unresolved issue in my life. I would really appreciate the help of clarity members in interpreting these readings. I am 33 and a 50-50 chance to get a degenerative disease called Huntington. There is a test for it but no cure - if this seems familiar to some, is that I wrote on this forum regarding the same issue 2 years ago. Anyway at the time, I made the decision I shouldn't take the test or more truthfully I let myself slip back into a half-lived life, not really making any decisions, either on that or my future in general, sometimes in joy and others gripped by fear. I finally took the test a couple of months ago but haven't got my results yet.I asked a series of questions all similar and here are the answers I got. I usually use LiSe's interpretation.1. What should I know if I go and get the results? - 28.2.6>33. I can read the lines and they talk about acceptance and jumping your head under water even if it's seems too overwhelming. But does the hexagram 33 here talks about retreating from getting the test results or that I will need to retreat to protect myself afterwards from others' influence?For the record I got 28.2.5>62, 2 years ago.2. What is the result going to be? - 5.1.2.3.5>2. I guess this is a bit of a silly question because I know that yes/no answers are a bit difficult. This is why I asked another question and gladly I got the same relating hexagram which allows me to ponder on that a bit more. 3. Should I go and get the results? - 24.1>2. Again I get receptive and 24 line 1 talks of not being influenced by others...It seems that not taking the test really stops me from projecting myself in the future and not being able to plan is a really horrible feeling. I think we humans are meant to do this even if plans don't always see the light of the day.But is there some influence here that I should be aware of or that I am currently taking on board and shouldn't be? I am really unhappy at the moment and really feel that I want to run away from it all, job, partner and the rest. I feel I don't want to be responsible and do the right thing... be brave like others would want me to be. I don't feel like smiling or being positive at the moment. The spark is just not there. I think I am happy to take the test on that basis but I just don't want people to expect me to go back to a normal life straight after that and have the courage to live a positive life...Anyway I would really welcome any insight you may have on those readings. Thanks a lot in advance.Carole"
1914,"Hello again Your advice has been very helpful in the past, so I thought it would be a good idea to ask you guys for some insight about a confusing matter.I asked the I-Ching whether I should write an e-mail to this guy and invite him for coffee and the response was 18.3.4>64My next question was: What will he feel about me inviting him?It said24.2.5>60Next, I asked how he would actually react to my invitation and I got48.4.5>32Finally, I wanted to know how our relationship would develop after (if) I took this step?The response was30.1>56I don't know what to make of it, since 18.3.4>64 seems to say ""Do it"" but the other responses didn't seem so positive...I would really appreciate some help.Thanks,Anais"

1919,"Hello to everyone. About six months ago, my long-term partner left me. I thought I'd never heal from the grief, and part of me is still struggling with sadness. Yet after a long period of estrangement, we seem to be warming to each other again-- on a friendly, not romantic level. I still love her but for the first time feel persuaded in my gut that right now we're better off not being a couple, and part of me is just really relieved to have her back in my life in some form (no one knows me better, and despite all the pain of these past months, I adore her). I am concerned though that maybe attempting a whole new kind of relationship isn't realistic. I want to try, but am not sure I can do it. I asked the following:--Can we really start over and have a whole new kind of relationship: Drew hexagram 3 unchanging. (New start but some difficulty? seems somewhat promising)--What approach should I take with her: drew hexagram 53 unchanging-- (hmm, lots of patience and slow growth. don't want to project too much hope on the marriage connotation of the hexagram though)--Will we likely end up as a couple again, or just be friends?-: drew 51 unchanging (Shock? not sure how to interpret).Any help is much appreciated. For the first time, I'm not even sure I'd want to get back together even if she wanted it, and in general I'm feeling heartened by our renewed connection, but also very shaky for obvious reasons. Many thanks!"

He is very handsome, witty, likes similar forms of entertainment and I know that we liked each other...  he asked for my tel number and email but has not got in touch yet...I asked the following questions:How does Y feel about asking me out? 61.1.2.5.6 to 2He is waiting for me to ask him out instead, being passive, maybe? What is going on in Y's mind in connection with me? 37.1.5 to 52 Our common friend told me he is single so I am not sure how this can be interpreted...we did bond rather well the first night we met at this party, listen to the same music, similar sense of humour etc etc...What do I need to know about Y? 42.5.5 to 24In view of the previous question / reply, I thought I'd find out if there was something hidden that I needed to know...so does this say that he is interested but conflicted somehow (line 6 changes his mind constantly) but that eventually he will sort himself out and make some sort of return and get in touch with me? I am not doing anything.

1922,"Hey!I've been away from a few days (more than a few actually) because I realized that I was becoming kinda codependent on the Yi (it even said so to me after asking about the accuracy of the answers).Anyways now I'm back and I've got a rather strange answer to a question, I asked ""Where will my relationship with X go in the next year?"" and got 61.1 > 59 Now most of the translations I've read say something about being prepared, but also talk about not over preparing, there's also Lise's translation which talks about being in one's true place, however I just don't see how that can apply to a relationship, does it mean that our relationship will find it's true place??Any help understanding this would be greatly appreciated."

Currently we are being friends, taking things slowly, and getting to know each other without complications...I wondered if it was time to move things forward a bit (was feeling conflicted, and intuitively that staying just friends for now was the best path), so I asked what will happen if....(you can imagine the rest)?50:3,4,5 to 59.59 again!!!??? But not sure of the context. 50 being establishing the new seems to be all about changing the status quo, but the changing lines indicate difficulty and misfortune. However 59 seems to indicate that it will all work out in the end.

1925,"I wrote on here a week ago about a man I've been interested in for about the past 6 months.   I thought things were pretty good between us, we aren't dating but we were taking more time to get to know each other which was making me happy.  I thought he was interested in me as well, but hopelessly shy like me.  Occasionally he would act like he was about to say something important but couldn’t.  Those interactions felt intense, in a way that was scary to me.  He honestly seemed intensely interested at the time and it terrified me.  Anyway nothing has gone forward and our relationship is still not very deep. I feel like this has gone on too long and something needs to change.  I wanted to know if it’s because he isn’t actually interested or maybe he is afraid of relationships.  Maybe he found someone else.  Lately he seems to be losing interest in talking to me.  I’m sad.How does he feel about being involved with me …………..  36.3>24I asked this because I could have misinterpreted his feelings.  I’m guessing this means he is retreating, but the light is still shining.  I also think that if you hide the light long enough it can go out.  Is this what he wants?  Changing line 3 suggests there is something difficult that he has trouble dealing with in regards to me.  The 24 seems promising though.  He might come back if I’m patient.Advice for me to follow, in order to weather this whole thing (I’m trying hard not to attach myself to outcomes, but it’s difficult) 61.2.6>3I suppose it means the situation will change and the change will be difficult.  It doesn’t suggest how it will change, does it?  Changing line 6 suggests that this relationship has no substance?  Yet the 2 suggests we resonate.What are the chances of ever being together? …………….. 6.5>64The result made me sad so I asked again and got 64 unchanging.  Does this mean that there is no answer as of yet, that decisions are still being made? Or does it mean that the relationship will stay as it is, incomplete and never quite connecting.  There are so many ways to read iChing that it is really very confusing.I really appreciate any answer at all.  Thank you so much.Last edited: Nov 22, 2009"

An old love has come back into my life, we are both happy to be in contact again, but there is some sense of apprehension  cos I think we both dont know what to expect. Sometimes I feel we pretend to ignore the past. We are careful (well at least I am) not to bring up the past, cos im done with it.

1927,"Hi,I have a few readings that I interpreted myself and I would really appreciate it if someone could validate my interpretations or tell me if I'm on the right track. I'm still learning to read the I-Ching and I think that some of my interpretations might be biased because of my feelings.Here's the situation:I really like him, but I just learned he is currently in a relationship. We used to look at each other a lot. He knows that I’m really attracted to him (I told him), but he still sends me e-mails. He never clearly revealed his thoughts or feelings about me. We just look at each other and he just sends me e-mails once in a while apparently to be nice to me. Sometimes, he acts like he really cares. Other times, he acts like he doesn’t care at all. Now, new factors made their appearance in the situation and I can’t take it anymore. I’m going crazy.Here are my questions:1: What can I do to feel better about the situation? 21 > 212: What will he do if I’m honest with him and I reveal ALL my feelings for him? 37.3 > 423: What will he do if I tell him I met someone? 11.3 > 194: Will he reveal his feelings for me if I tell him I met someone? 19.5.6 > 61Here are my interpretations:1: I think I need to be honest, get to the bottom of things and tell him how I feel about the situation.2: I think there might be two possibilities:A) He might have to discipline himself in order to stay faithful to his current relationship [37 line 3]. But he will end up making a statement in the end [42].B) He might have to use severity in order to make things clear that the feelings are not reciprocal [37 line 3]. He might not want to say it, but he will end up saying it [42].3: I think it will hurt him a little bit. I think it will make him realize something. But he will accept the new situation because he knows things change and there is nothing to do about it [11 line 3]. However, I think he will make a comeback at some point or do something [19].  4: I think yes, he will do it.Does it make sense? Thank you,Lyrandra"
1928,"Hi, everybody! I am looking for help with my reading because being emotionally deeply involved I cannot explain the answer I Ching gave me, or I can find way too much explanations, which is the same. Here it is: years ago I used to be lovers with this man, but living on two different continents distance put an end to our relationship. We stayed close friends, and he now has someone else. He admits his feelings for me hasn't changed a bit but he has made his peace with our living separated and being friends only. I turned to I Ching for advice in this situation because I don't seem to be able to give up hope despite of reality. The answer was Hexagram 62 with moving lines 2nd, 4th and 5th, turning into Hexagram 48.Please tell me what you read out of it. I know that nobody can do my job of the understanding but I'd like to know what others who are not at all involved read. Thank you very much!"
1929,"I just met somebody new ,  I feel attracted for first time in long time in a long time since I was sharing with other person. I feel that there can be something within this person and me, I have a perception of some connection, I asked the iching what it is the potential for this new person in my life and myselfI got hexagram 12 and related 56, I think to understand something terrible..Hope notcan somebody please  guide me to the right answer?"
1930,"My seven (nearly eight) year old daughter has been asking for a typewriter for nearly a year and recently wrote Santa a note asking for one at Christmas. (She does the Santa thing, a true believer.)I'm looking at two models, a Smith Corona Galaxie and an Olivetti #32, both portables. The Olivetti is a much smaller scaled typewriter, so that's an advantage for little hands. The SC Galaxie is bigger with a solid casing (no holes for her to stick her fingers between the keys.) They are similarly priced, clean and refurbished, and include their original cases. But the refurbished ones don't go cheap, so I'm debating.Asking about the suitability of each, here's what the Yi says:The Galaxie: 34.1>32 Too much machine for the child?The Olivetti #32: 1.1,3>6The second reading makes me laugh. Ewald translates line 3 as Until the end of the day the noble one is vibrant, vibrant.At sunset he is alert as if there is danger.Without fault.Click to expand...I can imagine my daughter up waaaay past bedtime, sneak-pecking at her little portable typewriter up in her loft bed. (Her ""fort"".) Always with an ear out for me in case I catch her. Anything to add to this?"

1932,"This is a follow up to another thread on multiple readings, and specifically the thoughts we were sharing on 9.3. The other thread is here.Just finished up my response email, and then asked the YI for an image of what I'd just written. You know, a little feedback.Got 9.3,5>41Now I KNOW I threw in a little white lie. Or a half-truth in my note. One of those ""polite lies"" we use so often in business situations or between people who aren't quite comfortable or intimate with one another. And the Yi told me I'd written a 9.3, but also 9.5. Or perhaps that I had turned a 9.3 situation into a 9.5? This bugs me because Hilary's WikiWing actually cites an experience when a man used a stolen credit card to pay for readings and when Hilary herself did not prepare well for a performance. The outer appearance did not meet the inner truth. And here I can confirm it with the knowledge of my own intentions.I'm not attempting to turn my acquaintance into a villain. I don't think I'm one, and I used a polite lie of my own in my note. And I'm not interested in trying to dig the truth from him. The situation does not call for it, and he would definitely shut me out if I tried. Yet when the question is specifically about sincerity, I think 9.3 points to the lack of it. Does anyone else have experience with this line? I'd love to hear what you think."

1934,"Hi guys,As part of my ""purifycation and recontruction plan"", I'm planning a talk with my husband (I recently separated, as mentioned in other posts). Last time we met face to face was 2 months ago. Since then, we had occasional chats on the phone and some text messaging, with mixed results.I asked about this possible conversation a while ago, with positive results, but when I asked about timing, I got a bit confused.So after 1 week, with a couple of unrelated chats with him in between, I asked again:  ""What would be the outcome of having this particular talk with him?""Hex 43, no changing lines.Now, this one sounds a bit dangerous, but it is also about the necessity of speaking out.I believe finding the right timing for this is very important, so here comes a string of questions:  ""What's the possible outcome of a talk with him if I ask him to meet me the last week of November?""Hex 29, no changing lines. The chasm. Seems terribly dangerous, but it also calls for action.I repeated the question for different time frames: ""What's the possible (...) first week of December?""Hex 54, no changing lines. Marrying maiden doesn't look too promising.   ""What's the possible (...) second week of December?""Hex 41, no changing lines. Decreasing, less is more. Not too promising either.I even tried to narrow it down ""What's the possible (...) between 25 and 29 of November?""12 .1.3.6 >49  Hex 12 sounds realy scary, and though 1 and 6 are positive lines, line 3 and the overall hex look very bleak.So I went back to my original question and rephrased it:""In the long run, will this particular talk with him contribute to getting back together?""26 .2.3.6 > 24 All lines seemed pretty positive to me, pointing that I'm in the right track.So I asked a more general question:""What is the best time for such talk?""51.5 > 1751: Thunder, shock, arousal. Line 5: Coming and going. Work is done.17: Following.I been cracking my head over this one. Thunder is something unexpected. Should I just do it, and expect for him to agree to see me (17)? Or is the best time a rainy day??? I wish there'd be an easy way to ask ""when questions""!Any thoughts would be very much appreciated.BAKGROUND - what type of ""talk"" is it:My personal work for the past months has been on understanding what happened, analysing my role in the break-up process, trying to grasp some clarity. I feel that I undertand some of his remarks (demands? /complaints?) a bit better now, and though I don't fully share his version of the story, I can understand better where he is coming from. To me, part of that process will make sense fully (or at least, in a more complete way) if I share it with him. Basically, I need him to know I don't stand quite in the same place I did when we last spoke.On the other hand, I'm interested in the actual encounter. I want to see how I feel when I see him, and I think it would be interesting -and probaly conducive to my goal of getting back together after some time- for him to see me (there's always been a strong physical attraction).Don't get me wrong, I know this is no fairy tale. I'm aiming at gradual process here, at a subtle influence, NOT at overnight solutions. My idea it to get him thinking, hopefully in a positive direction."
1935,"Hi everyone,and thank you for this space..I ask your wise advise relating two questions i posed the Yijing regarding October and a surprising and hard to understand (for me) attitude of my loved one.I take this opportunity because a lot of doubts I often have when talking with the Yinjing came up, and I think it's the perfect pretext to learn from your experience. Concerning the guy, I am day by day letting go and accepting his negligence/silence is really speaking for itself, that it is likely is not the one for me after all. I should also add I really like him. (Uff...)So, the situation is that he was supposed to join me in the place I live some time this month and he didn't, he just stop writing (our last mail exchange was october 1st) I asked What is October bringing to the process of our relationship? 34 (2nd and 4th line mutating) to 36.I got the ""Censorship"" part, but not the Great Power...Later on in the month, as he is now 20 days without contact, I asked What is happening on his side that could explain this silence? 14 (2nd, 4th and 6th lines mutating) to 36.(36 it is, hen?....) Ok, I'm not really asking for futurology, I am trying to get enlightening insights from what is happening, and also take the best out of a situation that brings me great frustration. (I admit I would prefer a mail saying its all over to this agonizing silence...). Which personal growth lessons could the Iching be pointing out to me here? Is this Great Power (34) and Possession in Great Measure (14) referring to his overpowering me in this situation? Does it have to do with his domination, or does it refer to a potential in the situation itself? Is the 14th trying to tell me that he possesses me, that is, that I am being played with?...It doesn't resonate, you know? But I could be in denial, as this abandonment is so hard to swallow...Overall, if I ask a question regarding someone else should I read the ""I"" in the text as this person, or always myself relating to this person? That is, in the 2nd question, who holds the Power in Great Measure, according to the Iching? me, him or the situation?I very much appreciate your insights on both questions and their connection to each other and the present moment. To finish, and even though part of me discards this line of questioning as a bit futile (when I have such drives I always tell myself: ""Breathe, wait, and see for yourself."") this time I didn't resist going for:Is maintaining hope of coming together as a love couple beneficial for me right now (or should I let him go at once)?9. the taming power of the small 1st line mutating to 57 The Gentleai ai aiThank you!yoana"
1936,"I was searching for threads that have the exact hexagram but to no avail so I am posting this to get more insights.I wanted to know if the attempt would be successful to get X to 'join forces', in future, in a project.56.1 and 56.3 look really negative for me.First, I am thinking the wanderer (56) refers to me. I understand line 3, regarding controversies that do not concern, but line 1.. trivil things.. does that mean X sees some topics as trivial?56.5 however, is very positive, and this is the confusing part. I would like to know if its an aye or nay in this, and 56.5 seems positive, but 25 does not really.So is it 3 against 1?"
1937,"Hello all,My boyfriend suggested I move in with him. This is WAOW but since if I do accept I have to move far away, leave my friends here, my job etc...It is a big decision. So I asked the Yi: what will happen if I move in with him?I got 23.6 moving to 2.Well I read a few threads about 23.6. As I understand it, moving will be stripping. It is right moving and leaving friends behing it is really stripping and splitting apart from them. 23.6 doesn't seem too bad, I read it is the end of it. The end of the process. And it has been a process because this idea of moving (not with him at the time) I have it since last year. But I didn't go through with the project. So this would be it.Hex.2 tells me to go with the flow right? Or maybe because I'll be with him, where he lives, I will be more dependant and in a position where I have to go with the flow.Any insights? Thank you :bows:Mousse"
1938,"I'm study the judgment of Gua 52 in the translation of Bradford Hatcher. I have some problem to understand the following sequence: ""From the middle of his implicitness, and all of its implications, he delivers the one he can be from illusion and what he cannot from thought. He cannot define himself in this way. The bounderies whichdefine him will be found in his interactions. The self-absorbed space is a place to be outgrow. He cannot figure out where he is without referring to his context."" The problem is rather due to my pour understanding of English. Can someone help me with this frase? Thank so much."

My social life has been my main focus lately because certain people are exhibiting very bizarre behaviors. I have asked the I Ching a couple questions in the past few days and today I asked a third question. "" Has Max told John that he has feelings for me? I received Hexagram 17( Sui) Following, changing to Hexagram 45 (T'sui) Gathering Together. In a past reading I was informed that it may be a possibility that John feels intimidated by someone( which is why he backed off from me). I thought it was a woman but from recent events I'm thinking that it may be Max. In hexagram 45 I don't know if the ""desire for union"" is Max or John. Any thoughts on this would be welcome."

1941,"I am hoping someone can help shed some light on this line or share an experience that played out with them when it came up in a reading. I received this reading when I asked what the significance was of all these synchronocities involving a country that I have never been too and honestly haven't even thought about. It all started with a tv show episode on a series I watched that did a special that night on this country, then all the sudden I started seeing the name of the country everywhere and hearing in passerby's conversations! yesterday, there were 3 synchronities involving it, which made me think that this is getting more intense and clearly a message is trying to be made but i just don't get it 43.6 seems like a very bad omen to pull in regards to the question I asked. Or is the line just warning me about something that could potentially happen to me that is bad?The ""no cry"" part also has me scratching my head, I have read several interpretations for this. One being that I will not be warned of the disaster coming to me and it will be unavoidable, another being that I need to speak up about something in order to avoid disaster.and most interestingly of all is this interpretation of the line: ""When one is in the esoteric world one may no longer be swift of foot-One gets caught""This shocked me, because believing in Sychronocities can be considered esoteric definately! But not sure how to apply the reference ""may no longer be swift of foot""? And not sure what is meant by ""one gets caught""...I am open to hearing anyone thoughts on the line itself, regardless if you believe in synchronicity...:bows:"
1942,"Hello!i'm confused about getting an idea from this reading: 33.2.5.6-32i asked an advice about continuing to cooperate with someone not very excited about our work (me neither)i notice here a combination of urging to retreat from this matter and of continuing to be involved in this work...in the end (after a pause?) maybe It's a warning to withdraw completely ? (taking the second hex. 32 as the present situation )not sure at allPlease, give me some insight ! "
1943,"Hi all,I try to understand line 28.3 . At a first sight looks like a bad omen but it doesn’t make sense in the context of the questions relate.  I attend to a workshop and the general feeling after that was good. It was a “heavy” situation , lots of emotions but also  what left was a sense of relief. Also some light was shed regarding some issues not clear in my mind. I asked Yi “ what should I know about that meeting” and was expecting something like a guidance to work those new findings in my mind.  Getting 28.3 puzzled me, because I don’t feel the tread of a sagging ridgepole. I wonder what is your experience with 28.3 .? Is always about a omnimous situation  , always a  warning for a danger coming? What if a ridgepole should bend sometimes or even fail ? Have you find that 28.3 says to you “go away from there” ?Would like to hear your thoughtsMaria"
1944,"I suppose it would be 'dream' career advice actually.  I currently work in a dead end job which I like but is not taking me any where in terms of promotion, etc... Anyway, I have a 'dream' job that I've been working at achieving during the remainder of my waking hours.  My question was - What do I need to do to achieve this career? It gave me 25.2.3 to 1.  My take on it is that I shouldn't work at this with any outcome in mind, just continue doing what I love without any expectation but then line 3 tells me that maybe I can expect the unexpected - perhaps something outside of myself to intervene at someone else's loss.  It leads to hex 1 which I think is saying lots of energy running through this situation but to what end?  I would really appreciate anyone else's thoughts on this.  Thanks so much in advance. "
1945,"I have the same question a lot of people have.  There is a certain guy I know, and it seemed to me that there was an attraction there, but it's been going on for a few months.  I'm horribly shy and had been fighting the urge to just withdraw away from him.  It's been very difficult to just be myself around him.  Lately I've been losing that shyness and wondering if there are any possibilities in the direction of a romance.  So I did about 4 readings asking the same question from various angles.  The first and last one were most interesting because they were symmetrical.Question 1:  What should I be mindful of during this period. (It was really a question about life in general.)result was 45.2.3.6 going into 44.Then I got to thinking about this guy and askedQuestion 4:  What he intended to do in regards to me (if anything).  I've been keep hoping he would ask me out, although that seems unrealistic considering how shy I've been.result was 28.6 going into 44.Sadly I think these reading mean I should stay away from this guy because it looks like something may happen that could only turn out badly.  I was just wondering if there was any other way to interpret this.Thanks.Last edited: Nov 15, 2009"

1947,"So another speculative relationship question.. hopefully somebody can help me with some perspective. Recently some events have reminded me of a person and after being over it to a fair degree Im wondering about her again. Short summary: I have had sporadic contact with a woman over the last two years. And around 7 months ago things ended. She was just formally ending a 10 year relationship in therapy and at an invited group night out she also invited what became obvious was another male interest. There seemed to be some ambivalence on her part that night, and on mine leading up to events and on that day, but sad to say I left with some hurt feelings. I wont go into laborious detail but I think, (wishfully? Im not completely sure), that there was really potential for a deep connection and mutual attraction. Perhaps the timing wasnt right, she was/is rebounding from a long relationship and my situation was not completely stable coupled with the fact that I dont have much relationship/dating experience. So yesterday I asked the I Ching :Is she sill thinking of me the way I sometimes think of her? (as in a desirable relationship partner/maybe somebody very special)  20.4.6 --> 45Are recent clustered events that reminded me of her, a dream etc. meaningful at all?    15.2.3.6 ---> 4And still thinking of her, maybe hoping to stop,I asked today:Am I just barking up the wrong tree?  56.2.4 --> 18Im just wondering if this is an inherently incompatible match or whether a little time and much better, more honest communication could lead to something between us.  20.4.6 --> 45 leads me to think maybe so. Hex 15 to 4 seems to be saying not really. I dont know how to interpret 56 to 18 though. Is there potential for repair or is it just decayed and all over dead? Thanks very much"

1950,"I have a son with severe behavioral issues. He is under 10, has had a lot of problems at school and at home with physical aggression. We are currently working with a staff of social workers at home that have helped us to make great strides in improving his behavior at home. Unfortunately, I don't think we've convinced his current school staff of the validity of the new approach, which is an obstacle to progress. Although the school specializes in children with behavioral issues, we have been asked to keep our son at home for several days in the last month.The question is ""What is right focus for successful path for X"". The result was hexagram 47.2.5>17. Line 2 tells me that I should limit myself to those elements that I can control, such as maintaining a consistent response with my son. Line 5 says that, although I am not at the controls, something good can come by being patient. Hex 17 tells me that I need to be open to new pathways that may become open in the future. If there are any alternative and/or clarifying thoughts, I'd appreciate insight from others.Thank you very much."
1951,"Hi, I've lost a friendship - but maybe it was never good for me anyway. Everyone says/said stay away, but, despite the pain I feel at his apparent disregard now, it was a beneficial meeting for me and we did become close, well close for me anyway, and have good exchanges. But maybe they only went so far and I just need to know when to say when - or leave things in the past. (I find it hard to move on, especially when it comes to estranged frienships which I feel mainly occured because of my insecurity or neediness).I asked, should I say, simply, that I regret losing this person as a friend? (email that I admit I was the one who ultimately pushed for this outcome)22.1,4 > 5622.1 Seems to say a simple, sincere gesture of honesty would be good (this is how I feel - but I have also learnt feelings are not to be trusted - as they seem to blind you from the truth to protect your ego - by trying to make you believe the best? Especially where rejection is concerned...)22.4 suggests I should trust him? Even when that seems unrealistic given the situation?56 - Is this the overriding answer? That this is not an appropriate emotional dwelling place for me i.e. I should move on from the idea of making one last attempt at contact?It's annoying - depsite feeling hurt, I don't feel angry - but this person might think it pathetic of me to be friendly now. But, it is rare that you find people you connect with, and so shouldn't they be fought for? But then again, if he really is hardened, then I should just keep the good feeling in the past - appreciate what I did take from it - and give in to its lack of duration? And let his presence in my life (or should that be head/heart) fully decay?I wrote the message and asked once more - send yes or no?41.2,3 > 22I think I understand from this that I shouldn't. That I would be being servile and throwing myself away 41.2 - 'which would bring no benefit to the other' i.e. by being weak and not holding my own (the last message I sent was indignant because he'd spoken to me harshly... but I walked into it - he had said wanted space, I thought that meant he was fobbing me off, so I cut him off, then regreted that and contacted him - messed him around generally - so he was harsh with me. Fool that I am. And this probably was all completely irrational to him - as he didn't know I had feelings for him - though he's probably guesssed now...)41.3> I need to really let him go, so that another might come along? Maybe he has someone else who is close to and so I am not needed - If I fill that sort of personal role, rather than a normal friendship.22 > again! Isthe basis of this hex's meaning - in relation to communicating with someone - about not trying to show off - or being light and having joyous exchanges rather than uncomfortable ones? And so, I should not probe this. Perhaps it's saying that he instinctively knows I want his friendship - and so, telling him again, is pointless? Because he Doesn't care?It's funny - I got 22 before when asking about contacting him - to appeal to him - and express my regret for turning him into an enemy. But I think this all comes, from it not being possible to be friends with someone you have strong feelings for... Perhaps, if I didn't - I would have felt he was simply not a good friend and thus would have moved on a while ago. But, my pesky heart won't let it let go.. especially as I feel it was my fault. But maybe that's my low self-esteem talking? Thing is - would he feel the least bit happy, if I did admit my mistake? If he wanted to be friends, surely, he would have been less, dismissive... but maybe he feels I did him wrong too?Thanks very much for reading - I'd really appreciate simple pointers.. Get it out of my system, or swallow the negative outcome and try and forget it? I just still have good intentions towards him, but they probably mean nothing to him now. Yuk.

1954,"Hello,A little background to the situation: There is someone I used to live with for a year, and in that time she and I developed strong feelings for each other, however nothing substantial ever happened between us; there were various reasons for this, but the point is, when the lease was up, we all (3 roommates) went our separate ways, made new friends, and sort of found different niches from each other.A few times it looked like something might rekindle, but it never quite did; I always got a sense like we were somehow revolving around each other and always managed to barely miss connecting at the right time for both of us. Now it is a little over 2 years after having lived with her, and we've been seeing each other at a lot of social gatherings again, and I'm still very interested in her. She off-handedly mentioned she's been dating a guy, but it didn't sound like anything huge, and I'm not sure I even care. To be honest, I'm weary from the elusiveness of the spark between us and I'm about ready to just point blank tell her my feelings and see what happens. I still care about her for sure, but I can't keep going like this. So I asked the I Ching:""What can I expect to happen between ""she"" and I in the next month?""It came back Hexagram 36, line 4 changing. (changes to 55 - Abundance)To me, this struck a real chord. It gave me a sense that no matter what, the heart of the matter will be dealt with and progress will be made for the better. It did puzzle me though. It's a very intense-sounding line in most readings, and very relevant to love/relationships in general. I also wondered for such an intense, almost grim line, it leads to a seemingly positive hexagram.How do you interpret it? I would greatly appreciate any further insight. Thank you.firerabbit"
1955,"HelloI don't normally get hexagram 4..... but am getting it a few times in relation to an intractable situation.  I've tried to shorten this post but it's still long.... sorry.The lines I'm getting in hexagram 4 are generally seen by the people on this website as quite 'nice' lines to get.  If there's anything 'nice' in my current situation I'm at a loss as to where it is.... I'm in a lot of pain, stuck with this person's 'bad behaviour' (they have a history of behavioural 'incidents' - walking out on bosses and leaving work in the middle of a shift, stealing a significant amount of money from work, upsetting co-workers, falling out with close family, extreme disrespect towards other close friends - I don't just mean heated arguments or slammed door or two, but nor do I mean fisticuffs - somewhere inbetween).As usual it's about a split between people, although this time it's between two very close friends, not romantic partners but nevertheless a very psychologically intimate friendship, initiated by the other person and responded to by me, and I still find myself in that dynamic - always the respondent, rarely able to much influence the general course. This friend has been a source of love and deep acceptance in my life, and it's been totally mutual. For a long time the friendship was a very healing one for us both; the kind of friendship that modern society doesn't value or understand, but which used to be common in previous eras. It's a very painful wrench to lose it, as it's so rare. My first question was a wrongly-phrased one but nevertheless sprang from a great need to get to grips with coping with my loss and shock. I believe that the I Ching would respond appropriately to that, although not necessarily by answering my question as put.The question was 'I thought I was loved - I want to be loved - is that so wrong?' (yes, yes, I know..... but I'm human and was in turmoil  and I do tend to be self-critical)The response was 4.2 > 23The next day I asked 'Is that it for this friendship? What about all the recent and not-so-recent signs of enthusiasm, warmth, and happiness freely sent my way? How can it flip to this so suddenly?'(Again, a sort of stupid way to phrase the question, I know.) I Ching's answer was 4.5 > 59And the following day I didn't so much ask a question but presented a summary of my predicament and sought what the I Ching had to say on the matter: ""I have no-one supporting me and this is an awful experience.... help!""I Ching's answer 4.2.5 > 20 Well, thought I...... there's a pattern here lol.Searching the forums here the interpretations for hex 4's line 2 and 5 are generally quite 'positive'. Some people quite delight in the meanings, and there are certainly 'worse' lines in hex 4!  Karcher's Yijing is one that I've found far too positive in my experience, so I'm tending not to believe his views like 'All will go well. The Way will open and lead to real connection and understanding. Be patient and have faith' - would that that were true! Although 'this young son can control the dwelling' could fit - the person in question admits he acts like a child, often a spoilt one, and we all know that they're not the ones who treat people well, and often get their own way. But that wouldn't apply if the 'child' is not a brat but actually refers to zi.... The interpretations on this forum are generally more down-to-earth and realistic. Yet still I find the view of these lines puzzling in this situation. Receiving this hexagram jolted me, and these lines jolted me again.I get that the I Ching's saying things about being open to learning from the experience, and not having preconceived ideas and so on, stripping all of that away and letting the experience be the teacher. I don't have spiritual beliefs/philosophies about life, otherwise I could put a 'New Age' spin on it about learning lessons etc.Hilary comments on line 2:""A tremendously fresh, open line. Why should today bear any resemblance to yesterday? If you have no set expectations, anything could happen. The challenge is to hold and nurture this state of not knowing, not to be in a big hurry to fill it.""I'm not feeling anything fresh or open. On the contrary, everything's shut down and rancid. Today's another day, but so far they're all the same..... full of bad treatment and rejection when I'm giving my best whilst trying to stay firm in protecting myself.Also:-""When all certainty is stripped from you, you realise you don't have a clue about who you are or what you're doing. What can possibly come next?""What's happening for me is that I'm returning to myself, the self I was before this friendship came into my life. I'm returning to hobbies and interests, and qualities I have as a person, that have been slightly lesser during the past few years. So it's more like knowing again who I am and what I'm doing. But yes, not knowing where I go from here is a source of pain. Taking the pressure off needing to know 'what next?' reduces that pain, so I can see some sense there in getting this line in this situation. But the truth is I don't want to go back to my previous life, because it was empty, and it now is again.""I get a very strong feeling from 4.2 that anything is possible now.""I'd love that to be true, but really can't see it at all. In many ways, not just socially, my life is a void and has been for years. And not a pregnant void at that! As for line 5..... it seems it's just as, if not more, 'positive' lol""Line 5 returns to the way, finds spiritual core and guidance.""I certainly am not aware of this at present..... the whole thing's a mess, a f-up, a disaster. And my life in general isn't far behind that state either. There really isn't anything much left - money, work, social life, love life, family, all mostly or totally gone. At the time I most need a good ally or two, I'm cast aside to fend for myself.Still, at least I didn't get 4.4! (nobody say 'yet.....' lol)If anyone's read this, thanks for reading, and anyone who feels like they want to comment their thoughts, or maybe how these lines work for them in their lives, feel free. I thought it'd be useful for me to go through the process of setting out my thoughts rather than just reading the forum threads about hex 4 in my head, if nothing else."
1956,"my girlfriend had cut the relationship about a month ago. however, i still love her and dont want the friendship to be cut. we have had some discussions, but there were no results. neverthelless, i think she is not so certain to finish it. but i am not sure that she still loves me too.i aske the oracle about the future of the relationship, whether we would resume? i received hex 12. 1, 6 changing to 17. i dont understand the meaning. everything is finished? or as the 6th line says, something is happening underneath? would somebody please interperet it for me with that question? thank you all."
1957,"Hi Everyone, I've just joined this community and would like to share.I've been using the I Ching as a spiritual, alchemical, transformative tool for many years but have had a very, very long dark night of the soul over several of them when I have not consulted or even thought of consulting the IC.  In fact, after all of my investigations into matters spiritual, mystic, occult (including magickal ritual), and divinatory throughout my adult life, I abandoned everything and arrived at this conclusion, there are no gods and all of this is just superstitious claptrap for feeble-minded people amongst whom I did not count myself a member.(Please bear with me)I still maintain that there is no superintendent deity or afterlife and still eschew magickal thinking.  In part, this is because a common feature of deities is their fearsomeness which prevents me from acceptance.  I treasure human virtues like compassion, tolerance, patience, open-mindedness and love, which I consider an action not a feeling. The Taoist way of thinking has always held a strong and lasting appeal throughout all of this. (I'm making non-sequential leaps to tell my story as succinctly as possible, again please bear with me)I have also, since the age of 15, used narcotic substances and alcohol as a means of getting out of myself and often as a magickal tool.  However, I am now 45 and 30 years of substance abuse has led me to the recognition that I am an addict and an alcoholic.  Subsequently, I have been into treatment to detox and I now attend Narcotics Anonymous to assist my recovery, so I am a recovering addict no longer in active addiction and in fact have decided, very firmly, to follow a life of complete abstinence from all mind-altering substances.  I won't go into the dangers of addiction, I'm sure you all know to some degree what these are.  You may or may not be aware of the way in which programs like NA and AA work.  The path to recovery is through what is known internationally as the 12 step program.  Again, without going into all of the details, this program is a spiritual not a religious one.  As an addict, I am spiritually bankrupt and key to the 12 step program is the awakening of a spiritual life.  I have immense problems with this, problems which I am thankfully beginning to surmount, but the need to have faith in a power greater than myself is paramount to my continuing recovery.  My resistance lies in my intransigent view that to accept this higher power contravenes my firmly held belief that rational thinking is 'best' and my atheistic standpoint is shattered by the implications of a power outside of myself, guiding or directing my actions in any way or that there is such a thing as fate.  Having said that, my best rational thinking got me here (the bottom and nearly dead) and clearly does not stand up to analysis.  Additionally, I understand the I Ching as a map or a metaphor, it is not esoteric (to my thinking). It is a wise and spiritual advisor who is able to hold up a mirror to my circumstances and allow me to reflect on a path through things in a way that is consistent with the patterns of nature and life itself.  (I'm getting there - keep with me)So, in inviting a higher power to reveal itself to me I find I have returned to the fabulous IC - the route is of no consequence but I can elaborate if people wish to know - talk about synchronicity! The first consultation I have made in over a decade comes from this background and my 'question' was this:""Please reveal yourself to me, help me to understand your will"".  this was directed towards my 'higher power' whatever that may be and entered into with an open mind.The divination presented was49 Ko - Revolution  Line 2 changingWith Guidance comes IntensityThe stripping away of old thinking - unmasking.On your own day you are believedSupreme SuccessThe superior man sets the calendar in order and makes the seasons clear.6 in the second placeMaking changes after some time has passed.  Action taken will be fortunate.  There will be no error.  Though weak it is in the correct place.  It is in the centre of the trigram Li representing brightness and intelligence.Let the subject take action in the way of changeWhen one's day comes one may create revolution.  Starting brings good fortune.  No blame.  So far so good and appropriate to the question and everything I have written here.I stumble somewhat in trying to incorporate the extended hexagrams into the consultation and it is here that I am interested to hear what it is that other people make of this arrangement.The Nuclear hexagram is 44: Kou Coming to meet (Don't marry the maiden!  Very odd!)The complementary hexagram is 4: M'eng - Youthful Folly (glad its not that then)The Hexagram of Contrast is 50 T'ing - The Cauldron I always love it if this comes up in a reading but I don't understand it's relationship here.The sequence hexagram is Ching - The Well, and I have surely drunk it dry and broken my jug!  I may be missing something in this one! I am only seeing it as the root of my situation.The hexagram of change is 43: Kuai - BreakthroughThe Yin Pattern is 13: T'ung Jen - Fellowship with MenThe Yang pattern is 7 Shih - The ArmyThese last three are hazy although I totally understand the fellowship of men within this context and can relate it to the fellowship of NA and other addicts helping one another to stay clean.So that's the reading - can I entreat your thoughts on all of this, I'd be very keen to learn what more experienced interpreters make of it.Also - I've been looking at Chris Lofting's site and I really don't get the process he is going through to describe hexagram spectrums, phasing and sequencing.  If anyone could direct me to some illuminating articles to study or how to employ these that would also be great.  Don't ask for much do I?Thank you for taking the time to read all of this and I look forward to your responses."
1958,"Hi,I would appreciate any help understanding myanswer. My question was "" what would be the outcomeof this situation? I got hex 23.4,5,6>45.The situation is about someone I care a lot, and I used to like a lot. He left for a trip for 2 months and came back 2 weeks ago and hehas not contacted me. Before he left we had kind ofmisunderstanding. Do you think this suggest we are ""splitting apart"" or ""gathering together"" Thanks!"
1959,"I've had a week of hexagrams with no changing lines, which I quite like, always seems to give me a definite simple answer. I another post I mentioned 17 in response to a question about how I should proceed with a particular relationship, and I asked (in relation to the same relationship) how will things unfold over the next 2 months, and received 64, which once again made perfect sense, as this is the beginning of a new cycle, and things are moving from disorder to order, but probably won't get anywhere particularly different fast.But today I asked, 'what do I need to understand about myself in relation to this situation'? I got 59.I think this makes sense to me, I like Huang's description: ""The inner gua is water, its attribute is danger. It symbolises one's vital energy blocked within. The outer gua is wind; its attribute is penetration. Penetrating and breaking the blockage leads to dispersion.""I'm aware of being frightened of being hurt and holding back to prevent that from happening, this made me think that its time to let go of a little bit of the ice! The other bit of 59 seems to be about having faith ""the king should arrive at the temple to pray and ask the blessing of heaven"", and confidence ""He has self-confidence so he is able to live and work in peace"" (which often right now I'm not doing because of worrying about what might happen...).Is that right? Thoughts appreciated E"

1962,"Hello again I asked the IC ""what is ahead of me these next 6 months in terms of excitement and passion-based success?"" and I received Hex 1 unchanging!I never really fully understand hex 1 because it seems to have so many different meanings and applications, but I've read a lot that it's a very positive hex....So I asked the IC ""Can you please give me any more clues?"" and I got 30.1.2 > 50 which was also very exciting and positive i.e. talks about the stirrings of a new bright presence and how one must be careful with the first steps i.e. preserve inner composure and have serious intent (line 1) and also about the yellow light and supreme good fortune by (line 2)....and then hex 50 which is about the transformation vessel.So I'm thinking there is a bright new way ahead for me which will transform over the next six months??Then I asked the IC a series of questions regarding what the Hex 1 might relate to e.g. a creative project (25.4.6>3) or a great job or business opportunity (2.2.6>4) or love, as in the marriage kind of love (45.4.5.6>23)....all of which I couldn't really translate very well except the last one....i.e. 45.4.5.6>23 which I took to mean there will be a fortunate opportunity to gather with people for unselfish purposes?? (line 4) and that trust will be gained (line 5) and that finally the lamenting and tears spent over wanting this kind of relationship or alliance, will eventually pay up! i.e. others will have clarity about me (line 6) and with 23 as the directional hex, this will strip away all of the old blockages and allow for connection and communication​And finally asked the IC....""But what specifically does the Hex 1 relate to here?"" and I got 43.3.5>54 ...which talks about having to put up with criticism and hurtful people (line 3) but that they will eventually disappear and one just needs to remain steady, keep moving forward and don't be deflected from my desired course (line 5)...for line 5 Karcher also talks about have a choice between 2 alternatives and having to be decisive and quick...then 54 is about a certain powerlessness...So I'm thinking overall......that there is a certain powerlessness to my situation at the moment, including having to put up with criticism regarding me, my choices and path etc., but that this will soon lead to a breakthrough and some real choices??Any light on these responses is greatly appreciated....I'm really keen to learn about what Hex 1 has meant here for my initial question since it seems so positive.....i.e. does it represent something bigger and more tangible than just the breakthroughs interpreted above?Or have I completely gone off the track with my interpretations......thanks as alwayssofia :bows:"
1963,"This answer has thrown me a bit because it seems so dead end.  I asked about a very long term health issue.  Don't want to go into detail but its something i have tried many approaches to dealing with as it involves a certain amount of chronic pain   . Though nothing life threatening its something I always think there must be some approach that helps/works.  So I asked a very open question of something like ""how do i make this better ?""....and got 12 unchanging.  Seems to me that says I can't win, no use to even try to make it better, that i have to accept it.  The fact that its unchanging makes it seem kind of final and incontrovertible as well.  Ah well if thats so, so be it, its something i'll have to live with like many people do - but it goes against the grain in that it seems a bit of a passive and hopeless approach to take.Can anyone see more than this ?  I'm just stuck at seeing this answer as a pretty emphatic ""No you can't make this better"" -Maybe its one of those times you have to accept a hard answer, i think its likley it is - I just have been wondering over it for a few days.  The question 'how can i make this better' was pretty general, i suppose i was looking for an approach/attitude/avenue rather than specificsLast edited: Mar 31, 2008"

1965,"My oldest girlfriend G was in a severe state of anxiety. She told me she had been shaking, even. But she couldn't say exactly or precisely what was bothering her. She thought it was one thing but I was doubtful about that. So I thought of the Bach Flower Remedy called Aspen, which is for fear when the person cannot say what's wrong and is trembling with fear.I brought my friend a bottle of this Bach Flower Remedy but she wouldn't take it, because she is very skeptical of alternative remedies. I was mad at her for not even being willing to give it a try.Next week she was wringing her hands and saying that she wanted me to ""hold her hand"" with regard to her trying the Bach Flower Remedies for the nervous state. She had been to a doctor who had prescribed some tranquilizer or anti-depressant, whatever, but it hadn't worked fully to relieve her nervous symptoms, and she was still trembling with anxiety.I have been hesitating about ""holding her hand."" I am not a physician, trained to prescribe. Over the years I've gotten into acupuncture, the Bach Flower Remedies -- anything that might help people, actually. She would prefer to use me as the ""strong horse"" who is going to rescue her, but I'm just another person like herself. I mentioned the Bach Flower Remedy to her because I had used it myself. That's all I have to go on; my own experience. I asked Yi: Do you advise me to hold G's hand with respect to the Bach Flower Remedies as she requested? I got 26.3.5.6 > 60. Line 5 seems to say that in dealing with something, know its basis and find its mainspring. Get to the problem at its roots. I have always had trouble interpreting H26. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated."
1966,"Hello again I'm in the thick of Law exam study and am strangely enough enjoying it! But with only another year to go before I finish, I'm wondering if I should go down the path of actually practicing law (if I did I'm interested in either the criminal system or a social justice area or international trade law)....So I asked the IC....""Is my calling in life to be a lawyer?"" and got 23.3.4.6 > 62 which talks about stripping away the old and that things will fall into place in their own time (line 6) and with 62 as the direction then perhaps that I should just take things day by day??...Wilhelm talks a lot about evil which is really confusing  So I asked the IC to clarify i.e. ""Could you please clarify this further IC?"" and got 33.2.6 > 28 which talks about holding firm to my inner true self (line 2) and stepping away from the busy-ness of it all i.e. cheerful retreat in order to get clarity (line 6)?? but then I don't understand the 28....Is the IC saying I should strip away or refrain from old ways of thinking such as that I actually have to have a calling in life, when I really don't? OR is it saying to strip things back, step back and take it day by day and things will fall into place?thanks as always :bows:sofia"

1968,"Hi All,I really am getting discouraged. A recurrent them in my ""dating life"" is having someone just disappear off the face of the earth after several dates that seemed to go extremely well. I don't think I'm misinterpreting, and I don't think I'm one of those crazy people that sends them running...at least I don't think! ;] The last one was two dates that went very well, and then a broken date because of a business obligation, but a follow up email apologizing AND a phone call, but nothing since. And that was a week ago. I feel that things were going well. I have had dates that didn't, and have sent me running, so I don't THINK I'm just seeing what I want.Anyway...I asked why does this keep happening to me?    1.3.4 > 9What am I doing that is contributing?64.2 > 5I asked the second question without fully understanding the response to the first.

1969,"dear all,I'm at an important crossroads trying to decide whether to cut someone out of my life who has mostly been a source of ambiguity and confusion, or to remain open to connection with her. I don't want to reiterate all the details, but let's just say she has sent me extremely mixed messages and made me feel there was something substantial building between us, but has not followed through and clearly is afraid of calling a spade a spade or being honest about the dynamics going on. This is a ""romantic friendship"" of a pretty torturous variety, and part of me feels like cleaning my hands of her, because I''ve often stated clearly what I feel, and she seems to toy with me.Asking whether to cut her out for good or to remain open to some kind of connection, I drew 44, lines changing at 4  and 6, to 48.

1970,"I have a male friend that I had an intimate(?) encounter with, but we have never gone ""all the way"". He only wants to talk to me when we are in social situations (get togethers, or hanging out). He never calls me, but when we are out he acts like we're a couple, and watches to see if men approach me. I consulted the Yi and asked ""why doesn't he like me?"" I received 62 Preponderance of the small changing to 16 Enthusiasm. This may seem strange but,due to other things that I have noticed about him, I wondered if he keeps his distance because of a disease, so i thought it was strange that Line 5 of hexagram 16 mentions a ""chronic complaint"". In another thread, I read of someone else receiving hexagram 62, and the nature of the relationship involved was not good. There are more complex details to my situation that I'll spare you all from but, I'm contemplating how Enthusiasm connects to Preponderance of the small? I'm not in a rush to connect with him(if at all), and I doubt that he's feeling that about me. I was just wondering if his behavior is based on something that I did, or something that's going on within himself?------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    EST 2:11 pm... I see people reading my post but not touching it! It's a strange, contradictory situation right? I've never had an experience like this before.----                                                                                                                                  EST 2:25pm... Okay... so after I posted a little while ago I was kind of guided to a page written that had insight about the individual hexagrams. In this case I think the details do matter. Hilary wrote hexagram 62 is about ""crossing the line'( which is how this guy may be perceiving the situation since I was originally introduced to someone else in the same social circle). A relationship will never develop between me and the other guy I was originally introduced to because he has obligations that I don't want to be a part of. I read a piece where Hilary said that hexagram 16 is about ""energies that seize you"".                                                                                                                            So, I'm thinking the guy my query was about may have feelings for me, but doesn't want to connect with  me on a more personal level? I'm confused because it seems if that were the case he would try to hide his attraction instead of trying to associate with me in public? Usually, we are socially drinking alchol at these get togethers so maybe the alcohol just makes a sexual attraction come out? Or, maybe it's part of a plan to find out what kind of woman I am? I am very confused about this man's true intentions. The bizarre thing is that I do not necessarily even want a relationship with him, I just want to know what he has up his sleeve regarding me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If anyone can see this situation more clearly, ( from the outside looking in) I would truly appreciate the input, because this rears it's head a few times a week for the past 2 months.                                                                                                                   Also, this man I'm speaking of told me he's not ready for a realtionship, so since I tend to take people at their word, I refrain from showing him too much attention, and letting him know not to touch me (in a nice way).Last edited: Nov 7, 2009"

1972,"Hi all,I’m a bit frustrated with my self because of the way I handle a situation between a acquaintance of mine. She wants to befriend.  I don’t and I try politely to avoid her, although after a lot of pressure went out for a coffee with her, some time ago.The problem is not her, its me because I feel unable to end the long conversations and put down the phone.. Something happens and she immobilize me.  So I asked Yi “why I can’t say no to that “exchange”. And got 20.3.5 >52Chuckled when I saw 52  and the feeling of been immobilized but I guess it means that I have to be more strict to her and  don’t let her intrude in my private space ( it feels like an intruder although I know that somehow she gets a permission for doing that because I don’t cut it) . I read lines 20.3 and 5 as looking to myself and my behavior and try to see the reasons I can’t react. The overall reading seems like Yi threw me back the question. Well, looking again my wording , doesn’t surprise me, lol .  So , I had to asked another question, just in case it clear up the first reading. . The Q was “is there anything else I need to know?” and got 30.1.2.5 > 44.I read two possible answers. Based only to the two hex  perhaps Yi says that she is the 44 woman which clings ( 30) to me. The other version is that Yi shows how to separate from that woman or how to become a 44 woman and make my intentions clear . Lines 1 and 2 make sense. But what confuse me is line 5 . I wonder if there is something I’m missing re those reading. Any ideas would be appreciated.  Maria"

My daughter-in-law is a wine distributer and every night she brings home opened bottles of the finest wines. If we don't drink them they get poured down the drain. Now neither my son or daughter-in-law have the slightest interest in this stuff. They can take it or leave it. I on the other hand am beginning to realize I have a problem. At first I made light of my drinking saying, ""It's five o'clock somewhere!"" and ""Drink up! There are alcoholics in India going through withdrawal!"" but last night once again I'd had a few too many and I spilled some boiling thick gravy on my hands. Today I have nasty, painful blisters. It's no longer funny.  I asked the I Ching, ""How can I resist temptation?"" and received 29.5 > 7. 29.5The abyss is not filled to overflowing,It is filled only to the rim.No blame.I see this as meaning one glass is okay but not to over do. It's pretty clear but I thought if I posted this here it might help me stick with my intention.Any thoughts, suggestions or prayers much appreciated.rosada"
1974,"For some time now I had a feeling that someone was stalking me online.  I now have proof of it.  Someone has created a user account using my real name and included an embarrasing profile, including a link to where I work.  I'm beside myself.Why was that account created? 12 unchanging.The person feels that he (I believe that it's a man) wants to get things moving, to start something.  What does the person hope to achieve by doing this?  4 to 33.There were many moving lines here.  I'm not sure how to interpret it given the circumstances.  I think it may reflect the fact that the person did this without too much thought.  How does the person who created this account feel about me? 31.3.4.6 to 20Three moving lines.  Should I interpret each line or take note of the hexagrams as a whole?  My instinct is to do the latter.  I've felt for some time now that this is a case of an interested male making inappropriate moves toward me online.  This answer seems to bear that out.What should I do about this?  28.5 to 32A withered poplar puts forth flowers.An older woman takes a husband.No blame. No praise.I think the Yi is telling me not to do anything.  This is a situation that is simply ""coming back to life"".  (I can't imagine that the Yi is telling me to marry the man)"
1975,"This is an update on the painfully slow process of a job application that I filed about a month ago with responses from Lise, Ginnie and Willowfox.... See http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=8736I interviewed this AM. The interview went well, but my friend on the inside tells me that there is another person that I am up against. Like me, this individual interviewed ""very well"" according the my inside information. So I asked ""What are my chances of being offered this position?"" In response I got Hex. 35.5>12. The change line and the relating hexagram seem to be different in tone. So the blended take would be ""Yes, but no"" ...does that sound right?35.5 would mean ""Very Good!"" but 12 would imply a blockage or stagnation...Could this mean that, although I am the chosen candidate, there is some other blockage that would prevent the offer from being actualized (I just read about a hiring freeze in my organization, although this policy should not affect job postings that have already been, well, ""posted"", such as mine.)The other thing that I'm theorizing is that the job is something I ""should"" turn down. I have been a bit ambivalent about this position, but have recently become quite excited about it. Thanks in advance."
1976,"Hi everyone,I'm new here, and I would like to thank your help in advance.I have recently separated from my husband. The process started earlier this year, with lots of confusion, and we finally split around September. I don't want to go into much detail, but these past months were terrible for me and I miss him a lot. Separating was not my idea nor something I supported at all, but you can't really force something like a relationship.In any case, I still hold hopes of getting back together, but there's a lot of pain between us now.So I asked the Yi the following question:How should I act to get my husband back?Answer --> hex 24 changing lines 4 and 5, changing to hex 17Hexagram 24 is one I get often, and I always interpreted as his return, or as the return of my loving relationship with him... But I could be wrong.It'd be great if I could hear your opinions on this reading.Thanks!"
1977,"I would love to see some more feedback of developments after a reading here...I have seen a couple and that's encouraging. I assume it is not required but since so many people are so generous with their time over here, it would seem the minimum one could do in my opinion...Bea xx"
1978,"Hi everybody. I recently joined after reading many posts for a while. You all seem to take this as seriously as I do  so I would like your input. I have an attraction to someone I shouldn't be attracted to so I asked the Yi King how that person feels about me. I recieved hexagram 17 changing to hexagram 54. I have worked with the I ching for the past 10 years and have always done so alone because many people don't understand, so all feedback is welcome."
1979,"Good afternoon to everybody. I haven't been here for a while... Well, a ""while"" of two years. So this post is partly about what happened in between, and partly about the last, favourable, disconcerting response I had from the oracle. The important things occurred to me in the last two years are: 1) my first essay is about to be published (I already have the page proofs and I am terrified about checking them!); 2) I partially solved the complex inheritance problem I had with my aunt (that means I solved the most relevant issue in it, but not the worst - but the worst, being not that relevant, will wait a while); 3) quite incredibly, about two weeks ago, a publisher, who did not call me for one year and a half, phoned me to say he decided to release my novel in the spring/summer of 2010, and to present it in most important bookfair in my country (...after such interesting statement, he disappeared. But I am not worried. Either he is crazy, or he hates to use the phone so much, he must wait some weeks to call again - which unfortunately does NOT exclude the first hypothesis. Anyhow, I am quite sure I am going to hear from him in about two or three months..)As you see, these are all good news. Astonishing good news. The horrible new is, my work situation at the University is still uncertain and there are no hint than it can get more definitive in a few time. The worst (there is always a worst in the horrible!) aspect of it is, it seems that next year there will be some relevant change in the present legislation,that will make even more difficult, or even that will factually prevent me from accessing the teaching staff.Now it happens that I consulted the Oracle both before and after the news about the changing of legislation. The two answers are:1) (before the news) 47 changing to 582) (after the news) 58 changing to 61 This sounds to me I have nothing to worry about. Particulary, 61 is a hex I often receive when I have no hopes about something, while it tells me that I am wrong, that everything will go the right way. But this time I am particulary pessimistic. So, if you see some dark side in the answer I got, just express yourself: you will only confirm my fears. Ps. I remember a Bruce who told me in the past I would have published in the end... I just want to say: THANKS!"
1980,"Some of you may remember my  questions regarding my attraction to someone I work with who is in a supervisory position. We both play it very cool, and as of yet, we've only exchanged flirtatious glances and the odd comment. As of yet, neither of us has crossed the line to asking the other out. When I feel the time is coming - that he may ask me out - I go into a neurotic mindset by setting up roadblocks (self doubt and feelings of unworthiness) in order to avoid connection - as much as I want it!!!So I asked Yi for Insight into clearing my roadblocks to intimacy, and received Hex 24 unchanging. A big wow. Karcher says ""Remember your reasons for coming together. Re-visit your origins with each other. Now is a time for ease, so take advantage of it. Don't try to control things. THAT is the reason I go into a tailspin as I want to control the situation, thereby losing the spontaneous joy of the present moment. He says ""Returning to the Way is the root of all virtue, love and power. In the act of returning, you can see the heart of Heaven and Earth"". Wilhelm says - turn back from external things, turn back to one's inner light.It is only a beginning, a potentiality, but must be distingguished from all other objects. Know oneself in relation to the cosmic forces.Laurie"

(in terms of priority ...)50.4.5.6-48the answer the I Ching gave to me is very surprising because allthough i can imagine how hex. 50 and 48 relate to someone 's interest in humans (that's me ), i don't see how these could be projected onto people ,relationships and life situations i meet /provoke ...another question about an issue i usually feel embarrassed to discuss (expecting probably my partners to guess my thoughts, pretty wrong ): how should i approach the fidelity issue?14.2-30The i  ching gives me a kind of approval: yes, that's a big issue in any relationship (why do i think anyone knows that? and still i choose dishonest partners who cheat or lie...and from whom i necessary separate shortly? )what would be your opinions about these 2 readings; i appreciate any help, any idea (i pick up the pieces of my soul, cleaning them from the mud of my fury and disapointment)Last edited: Nov 3, 2009"

1984,"I've been having issues with my achilles tendon. Fine, rest it. But I have a half-marathon that I want to do in 4 weeks...this would be a great personal accomplishment, something I've wanted to do for quite a while. This injury I did rest for a few weeks, just cross-trained, and went back to running almost two weeks ago. Today I set out to do my 5 miles and ouch! I'm in some serious pain. After two miles I turned around and walked home.I'm furious and panicking at the same time. What am I to do?  How will I be able to do the race if I can't even train?I asked, ""What do I need to know about this injury?'31.3.5.>1631.3: I want to keep going, but that would be impulsive, wouldn't it?31.5: Remain strong, be firm.

1985,"One more reading about the friendship I've re-started...I've been aware of how things could get more complicated very fast even though I'm trying to take things slowly with this guy. I realised today that I also have a lot of anxiety from previous experiences, and reacted badly to seeing him today when we were both tired and a bit down and things felt very difficult. My first response was to panic and want to shut down completely so I asked:How should I proceed with this friendship? 17 unchangingMy interpretation of 17 is that this is saying 'just go with it', that its the beginning of a friendship which is just about starting to understand and interact with each other and be aware of how our reactions impact on each other. It felt quite reassuring, and made me think of how in any relationship one follows the other, and at times the roles reverse. I also understand it as saying that persistence in this course slowly and steadily is the right thing to do.Any further thoughts?Thanks!E"

1990,"Hi all,I need some help with a reading. I’m trying to contemplate some changes have occurred lately and I asked Yi’s help too. The Q was “what has change” and got 50 no changing lines. At a first glance it makes sense, it describes well the situation but still is very vague. By saying that I mean its more like an affirmation rather than a reading going further. Perhaps says something more but I can’t see it. It sounds more ""its a cooking time , the food not ready to be serve"".Wilhelm says: “ It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise a fate that lends power to his life “ this is something its not clear to me. How do you read that phrase ? What I’m missing here ? anything you can offer will be appreciated.Thanks,maria"

So I was initially a little Peed off. Has my friend stood me up?! Since then I have rang her and text and I've had no reply. I've gone from worried sick, to angry ""how dare you stand me up""?Everything was going well between us- we hadn't seen each other for 3 weeks previous untill she texted.I cast and wondered if anyone had any ideas!

Answer: 6 Conflict, no changing lines.Since there has not been a conflict between me and him, my instinct tells me it might well be a conflict within himself and that's why he is keeping a bit of a distance (and we didnt meet this past week when we should have done since we happened to be in the same city at the same time).So I asked another question: Who is the conflict with? Between whom? Answer: 51 The Arousing, no changing lines.Ahem...I am not sure how to decipher that. I asked what the best approach to that would be?Answer: 36.1.5 into 39 (horrible!??)And finally, I asked ""Is he done with me?""

2003,"Right Approach to I Ching 6.1.4.5>41Okay,  i am promising myself as I type this that this will be the last question that I send to the online clarity group for a while. I fear I am in danger of making this an addiction, which is actually the point of the query that I'd like to get feedback on...I am both fascinated by, and leery of, divinatory tools.  On good days, I've used them as less of a ""What will happen"" sort of way, but more of "" What is really at issue here?"" or ""How did I get where I am?"" or ""How does my perspective affect where I can go?""...Sort of a psychoanalytical tool on the psycho-spiritual level, if you will. At the same time, I'm highly susceptible to becoming obsessed with wanting to know what will happen. Not so different from a lot of humans on this planet, I suppose. Only recently, some therapists working with my 8 year old son have theorized that his challenges with making friends and interacting with groups stem  from limitations around tolerating even the most minimal levels ambiguity or uncertainty. When I think of that in context to my own life and immediate family members, I see a LOT of genetic connections. Like my son, I'm also a bit obsessive-compulsive...When I go into something, I go into it whole hog. Until recently, the I Ching has been something I've steered clear of, despite the fact that one of my favorite thinkers (CG Jung) has written extensively upon it. Its symbolism felt so alien to my education and orientation that I've found it daunting. And then I found this website....TA DA! Hordes of people weighing in, lists of resources, contextual stories, different discussion threads...I suppose you could say it has offered me a way ""in"" that seemed accessible. The complexity is organized in a way that feels more approachable. (So, my compliments to Hilary for creating such a unique resource, as well as those that feed it to make it such a multifaceted discourse for learners like myself. )And yet...the desire to use the I Ching to micromanage my own expectations about the future is so strong. And I do worry that I'm casting WAY too much, and about the same thing over and over again. So my question is ""What is right attitude toward the I Ching vis a vis fear of unhealthy obsession?""The response that I got was Hex. 6.1.4.5>41.  I can see that 41 is telling me to ""reduce""....number of readings perhaps. The changing lines in Hex 6, although generally auspicicious, are less clear...I got the idea of asking this question in the face of a larger debate that I've been reading about on the site regarding a divergence of opinion from ""diviners"" about what the ""shared reading"" section is intended to serve...Giving answers vs. a coaching resource....This is issue is extremely relevant to me personally...How serendipitous! I'd like to steward this interest healthily, because it is just SO RICH...Perhaps I could even stick with it long enough so that I can get to the point of giving back.

2006,"I asked:How will my relationship with J evolve and deepen though this winter?I received Hex 17 Following Line 3 and Line 5Changing to Hex 55 AbundanceMy former partner and I have been seeing each other since the late spring in a platonic friendship, following a careful step-by-step process, with significant changes and improvement. We presently have a weekly date or activity together. We are moving slowly, letting go of our past form to see what emerges. We both had a lot of personal work to do, emotional baggage that created serious obstacles in our partnership. Lots of individual growth has occurred through the separation and we have both made significant changes.At present the maintenance of an ongoing friendship, the elimination of many negative patterns, and the healing of past hurt and rebuilding trust is the good that has come from this process. We share good times as friends but maintain an emotional and physical distance. The time has not been right for more than that. We are not dating others at present.  The healing has been worth the hard work. J is not seeking a new relationship, and is not ready for a commitment. He wants to see how we evolve over time. In some ways I feel we are now working together as adults, having cleaned up the past influences, but its been a slow process. My hope is that we are able to establish a renewed partnership. I know this may not happen.  My question stems from a desire to know if more intimacy and possible reestablishment a partnership is possible. I have been working with the I Ching though this transition and it has been very helpful in this process of re-establishiing trust and not letting fear or ego run the show. We are making slow, good progress but there are clear limitations.I appreciate any feedback from the community regarding the hexagrams I received."

In response, I got Hex. 64 unchanging This says...Your goals are in sight, but don't take their acheivement for granted?...Or more, be open to that which is not yet clear but is seeking to be...?

2012,"Hello,Not such an emotional one this time I am doing freelance work for a company. The work itself is taking longer than their estimation, but that may be because I'm new at it.The last job I did took at least double their stated hours, but that may have also been me being overly cautious about getting it right etc. I want to ask two hours more (eventhough it was probably more than that), but at the same time, would rather they keep using me and miss out on an hour's pay. But then again if I keep under-cutting myself, they'll expect the work quicker. Bit of a catch 22. I have heard most freelancers negotiate. I asked the Yi:How far can I go? (add 1 hour to their stated time, or (the more realistic) 2 hours)28.3,4,6 > 59hex 28 is about being excessive and going the extra mile for something... so maybe it's worth it for the work itself - which is quite enjoyable - and not thinking of the pay? But then they'll keep expecting it of me..I think it may be saying that I need to forget my ego in this situation (59) to keep the ridgepole (the job) standing?The third line speaks of excess pressure on the individual - a burden growing (me overworked?) but then the fourth line speaks of 'working for the rescue of the whole' ie. sacrificing myself a bit for the company? And then the sixth line perhaps suggests I don't quite know what I'm up against? That I shouldn't be over-confident or pushy?So overall is the Yi saying it's better to meet them more than halfway?Any ideas would be most appreciated :bows:"

2016,"Hello -I asked the question, how can I overcome my addiction to sugar? and I received 28 with no changing lines. First of all, what is the significance of no lines changing?My thoughts on the hexagram are as follows;your body can no longer sustain the addiction, you must figure out a way to move on by withdrawing (meditation) and moving ahead. I have long sustained yoga practice that has been weak for sometime. Does this mean go in deeper to the yoga practice (meditation) and from there you will figure out how to move on.oryour life has too much going on and it is causing you great stress. you must figure out how to simplify or you will break under the pressure, do physical damage to my body.I have a demanding career as a professor/artist, I teach yoga and love my yoga practice as much as my art, I own a house by myself as a result of a divorce - it is a big financial commitment as well as time demanding - but I love my home, I have 4 dogs whom are my family - in retrospect getting 4 dogs was stupid but, Oh well what's done is done. My Mother and sisters (who do not like animals) pressure me to get rid of a couple of dogs. I am spiritually apposed to this idea as they are my children of sorts.So yes my ridgepole is sagging and I probably abuse food to deal with it but how can I simplify when I love all that I do?"

2021,"Hi all,i'm a noob here and am grateful for the boards presence.  I bought Wilhelm's about a year ago.  Read through the whole thing as part of what i saw as honoring the book.  Now, after a spell, i've learned how to aske questions correctly.  With that being said, I'd like some assitance w/ my interpretations.  There's alot going on in my life right now.  My lovely partner and I want to homestead w/  our 19 month old son.  But, i've got us upside down in our house, about ready to have the restoration finished so that we can put it up for sale.  My job, finances and ""mama"" stress has us not getting along very well.   I've got to keep this job just to make house payments.  Basically, i'm not sure if the house and all the work it has taken will be worth it in the end.  It wasn't originally a ""for profit"" purchase.  I bought it 'cause i thought that this is where my farm was going to be.  All the stress of us not living the lifestyle that originally made us attracted to each other has got my lady and i at one anothers throats and we can't see clearly enough to know if a change in lifestyle would save us.We are basically homesteaders stuck in the wrong place- me working a 9-5 office job and her being a suburban house wife.So i asked...What'll the outcome be if I try to sell this house?10.2 > 25Treading to innocence-  I resonate w/ the treading- ive been at this house project for three years- It's an old house that i felt needed to be restored and to honor it.  Ive put alot of love into it.  But, then the change to ""innocence"".  I'm wondering if this hexagram is calling into question "" whether or not i am as i should be"", or is it referring to the house?   On the surface, it seems favorable as we plan to use the money made to buy a few acres and start our farm.  next question...What is Amy and I's relationship leading to?12.5.6 > 16Stagnation that is ending w/cautious decisison leading to enthusiasm.I don't really know what to make of hex. 16?  I resonate w/ the text ""To arouse enthusiasm it is neccessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character of those whom he has to lead""You see, AMy is ready to leave this house right now, w/o trying to sell it.  She just wants to move on.  Or, maybe i'm totally off.  Experienced insight woudl be much appreciated."
2022,"Can anyone tell me what the lines in this hexagram represent? I am curious as to why it suggests that we must suffer the standstill and not mingle with inferior people. Does that mean that the person I am asking about is inferior?Second line says that ""standstill"" helps the great man to attain success and the fourth line confuses me about ""like mind partake of the blessing""So it is saying that the person in question is NOT of like mind or will become of like mind?Anyone who has a suggestion about these comments?  I would really love to hear what your thoughts are about these lines.Thanks"

He also has made skirts for himself out of towels.  I asked the I-Ching if he is gay, and I got the answer 18.2.

2037,"I've made a big mistake - or maybe not - but the pain of it is huge.I have cut myself off from someone who made me feel less alone in the world - but they betrayed my trust and made me feel disposable. Though maybe that was as much in my head as his mode of contact. His elitism now -and coldness, cannot be appealed to.  I should hate him but I cannot - though he has taken away my voice and standing. So a relation of any kind could be impossible. Friendship must be based on equality after all.I asked, is he thinking of me?33.2 > 44Yuk. Here I must be the clinging inferior man.What is the correct resolution?51.1,2,3,4 > 46It was definitely a shock to the system to realise how little he cared for me as anything in his life. But it's taking time to reach a sense of Pushing Upward away from thoughts of him. Could also be my lonliness at the mo making it so much worse of a loss, and make foolish attempts to contact him when he was clearly pulling away. Though maybe it could only have gone this way if he was always masking basic indifference. It must have meant much more to me, as I'm not so easy with people. Rationally I should forget and write off someone who has made me feel so bad about myself, but it seems uncontrollable - what, or who we hold dear. How do I achieve the resolution?29.6 > 59That is how I feel. He's degraded me so much that I feel trapped - I just needed a friend and the sense that he wasn't even that made me take action - but it only hammered the nail in the coffin further - and now estrangement is the result. But perhaps we're both better for it. Perhaps our similiarites were based on our faults. Some of them anyway. But in other ways it felt positive and creative. I know I just have to have faith that I'll meet others with just as strong a connection.. if it was even that strong and not just a fiction of my imagination or need for that sort of comfort - sometimes I've felt he can express what I feel. And that is why I feel so awful that I've lost someone I could share certain things with - like he gave me an avenue which is now blocked. But maybe I'm not giving others the chance to also be able to fill that role? And the strength of this influence probably means it's unhealthy (44)...Is the Yi saying it's hopeless? Not meant to be resolved in a friendly sense? Ruined by insecurity - or worse - delusion?I read something on 29.6 by Hilary: There may be an attraction to being imprisoned, subject to someone else's judgements and someone else's choices - very secure, no more surprises. Hm, yes, I've done it myself in small ways: 'so-and-so wouldn't be happy with that, so I don't even need to know how I feel about it myself.'This speaks to me. It's awful to say, but his recognition of something in me made a part of me feel valued and validated... because of the mutual understanding I felt.But maybe we can't get over people who we feel have used us - especially if they effected us deeply - because, only they could heal that particular bruising to the ego - through their recognition or remorse.Help Last edited: Oct 23, 2009"

2045,"Hello forum,  I'm new to using the I Ching.  As a teenager in the 70's I read it and thought it was interesting, but have only used it twice.  The first time was about a relationship, and I remember the phrase"" bone gnawing bone "", sadly, appropriate as it turned out.  Recently I was given a reading as a gift and found it to be so accurate in describing my life it was amazing!! ( In the past two years I have had my eldest son die at age 32, have ended a longsuffering marriage of 22 years, recognized that my youngest, very brilliant son has mental health problems, and most recently lost a job.  Thank God for God, is all I can say).  Losing the job seemed like the last straw and my solar plexus was in a wreck, though I acknowledge feeling oddly freed as it unfolded on a grey windy day, the Feast of Guardian Angels as it turned out! The friend who surprised me with the reading used yarrow sticks, and I asked a question really out of left field, considering, about a person whom I've been getting to know who confuses me, so I asked what my focus should be on this friendship (?platonic?).  I received the 51.3 hex leading to 55.  Reading the description I had to laugh, which is funny considering the laughter in the text.  I could see how this hex shows my life and maybe the move into a field I enjoy more, but not really about this person who disappears and reappears and seems way too inconstant and unreliable for what I need in a partner.  Since the reading in fact I've felt like my solar plexus is healing and I don't think about him very often anymore.  Just wondering what you'd think of this.  Could the hex be referring more to my job loss, or is it pretty reliable about answering what you wrote down, or could it be both.  What can you tell me?  I find the ""not losing the sacrificial spoon"" very interesting, being Catholic , and also since I have wondered how to handle all my feelings and keep within teachings I respect and love.  The images in the I ching are very interesting to me.  I love storms, and know that adrenaline rush feeling is telling me to pay attention, I've gotten the jokes God sends my way pretty regularly.  More than anything I want to do the right thing, though I admit I want what I want when I want it , too, I am A DOG after all (1958)  But I've had my butt kicked! God is really working on me!!

I noticed flood and tears as well as bemoaning old age.

2051,"hello I work within a very large bureaucracy. About three months ago, I initiated a formal greivance against my  management, stating that I was not receiving adequate compensation for my level of work responsibility. This was and continues to be an ennervating process, because I like being part of a team, and this action can be perceived, by its very nature, as distancing and ""look at me"" in tone. Yet there are new staff coming into the office every day who work with less autonomy on tasks of less significance that are rated as high if not higher than I am, so I felt there was no other choice.Ironically, the director of my office had previously been a good friend of mine; we started at my workplace at the same time in a peer relationship. However, she has not been responsive to written appeals that I have made, and just seems to avoid talking with me entirely. Having attempted to twice get management to agree to a compromise through the established phases, it is now scheduled to move into arbitration (it is in a queue, so I don't know when it will move forward). I continue to feel conflicted. I am looking for work outside of my office. If I do decide to leave, the greivance will not terminate, but a part of me just wants to let go of the toxicity of the whole thing.Asking for ""guidance regarding my greivance"", I received 18.1.3.4.6>43. I take this to mean that (1) I should not take it personally, but take care of business as I feel appropriate, (3) show my accomplishments so that people sit up and take notice (4) follow the proscribed rules in this process (as I perhaps didn't previously by not highlighting my contributions). But then I get a bit lost on line 6, because it seems to indicate deprioritizing worldly matters (which I do all too well in my idealism). In any case,  I thought thathex 43 seemed to validate my need to speak out...Then I read Rose's thread on applying for med school (life path) and saw some very different takes on the same lines of hex 18. If I understand this in my situation, I have taken all of the wrongs steps. Being out of step, stepping on toes, at the beginning of woes, and being better off setting my sights elsewhere.But then what of 43? Glargh. I don't know if I'll ever be any good at reading for myself.Any additional insights are appreciated if there is anyone who has thoughts to add to the pot.Last edited: Oct 22, 2009"
2052,"Hello,There are two ideas/ideals I have that I'd like to pursue. I know they are going to require hard work and I am under no illusions I don't think (well maybe some ). I asked:1. Should I invest time and money, or at least seriously consider doing so, into pursuing avenue A? (not for a while though)51.2, 5 > 582. How long-term can I potentially make avenue B? (a scarier avenue I'm about to follow soon that I'm probably less sure in my suitability for, than avenue A (but it is already 'in the bag')51.2,5 > 58Quite something (the readings were only a few days apart). They are both areas I'd love to pursue, but feel dwarfed by them. Perhaps the reading is saying despite potential danger, it'd be worth it because I'd be getting out there and meeting with new people and learning from experience (exchange of 58) and that I shouldn't worry about what I lose perhaps money and inner-equilibreum wise?Any thoughts/ experiences with this combination would be really appreciated as they are big ideas but maybe my motto should be 'Go for it!' even if I'm knocked off my feet a bit??Thanks :bows:"
2053,"Hello all,I am new in the forum , but I have read your comments forlong time. I would appreciate any help with my reading.My question was "" what can I expect from this person/ situation?I received, hex 51, 2,3,6,-14This is about someone I realized recently I have a lot of chemistry with. I am not sure what he feels about me though. Usually, I am cheerful, but trying not to show too mcuh my interest, but the last time I saw him I  perhaps crossed the line so today things were weird between us and I was wondering if it was because he feels uncomfortable with me.I am not sure how to interpret the I ching when there are  three changing lines. Ar both hexagram now equaly imporant?Many thanks"

2055,"The answer from I Ching on my question: ""How  can I get my life back on track again?"",was hex 2 with changing lines on 3 and 5, leading to hex 39.I feel kind of lost and lonely, and what I read in this answer is that I should try to accept things as they are.Be modest, try to be and do, as good as I can whitout expecting recognition from anybody.But I don't see how following this advice, could get my life back on the rails again.Does anybody see any other advice in this answer?"
2056,"Can you please help interpret this for me. Hexagram 42 and the corresponding Hex.23 seem to contradict each other. According to hexagram it sounds really positive and encouraging to pursue this. However 23 splitting apart says Not fruitful to have a direction to go. Mountain rests on earth, with generosity from above creating tranquil places below. Hilarys interpretation of hex. 23 says Stripping away- Everything outworn- every image, idea, possesion, protection must go. Even if it feels your skin. Then the space will be cleared."

2059,"Hi everyone!So, it's my birthday today, and for some reason, I decided to pull out the dusty I Ching out and ask the one question that's been bothering me forever: ""What can I do right now to get in a healthy relationship already?""  I'm 28 years old and have been on  just shy of 5 dates ever in my life.  Every time I ask someone they say no.  I'd say I'm a reasonably attractive female (used to do a little local modeling- at least have the right stats that people always talk about), people do not run away when they look at my face, people tell me I'm funny and smart, I have an interesting career (musician) that has really been taking off lately, and it just doesn't seem like a guy would realize that I'm dating material if I was the last female standing on the planet.  Yes, I've tried the usual tactics- my friends say they can't think of anything ""wrong"" with me and really don't get it, they don't know any guys that would be ""appropriate"" (we're talking they don't smell bad and can have a basic conversation) or even anyone single, hanging out in new places, new activities, work (I meet loads of new people all the time since I'm a musician), etc.  Anyhoo, Mr. I Ching pulls up hexagram 49, ""Revolution"", which gave me pause.   ""Whaaa?""  I see this dichotomy between fire and water, which is interesting in a way since I have a natal square between my Sun (Libra) and Moon (Cancer)- emotions vs. intellectual- they don't seem to mesh naturally for me.  It's also neat that it says ""On your own day/you are believed""- did this mean that others took my pleas for help as insincere in the past?  Otherwise I'm not sure- I am 100 gazillion % ready for a relationship, just want to explore my emotional and physical side already, it's like a part of me that I just don't have the key to, you know?  I don't know if this is  pointing to the need for something drastic (revolution)- what do y'all think?"
2060,"Hello everyone. This is my first post and I do feel someone out there can better help me then I could on my lonesome.In short, I just broke up with my girlfriend and moved out and into my sister's for the time being. In this short amount of time I hit it off with her room mate who we'll call K.Although K is attracted to me and I to her, she is kinda seeing this other guy and recently, things just dificult between us. All this after I asked her out, because I do feel in my heart she should be with me. So I consulted the I ching on the matter and I got the following.What is going on now? Why is she so distant?Hexagram 38 Line 1 and Line 4I kinda understood what was being said but im so damn insecure i feel like i botched it the other night when i didnt kiss her cause we were all dirnking ( im not one to take advantage of a girl whos clearly drunk )and so then i asked, What would be the best course of action now in my sitatuon with K?Hexagram 57 Line 2, Line 4 and Line 5I kinda get it though since it does talk about someone potentially working against me here and i do believe its this other guy whom ive met. But i just dont know how to make sense of it. Is my want for this girl botching my readings? Someone please break it down for me!"

The work is simple and payment pretty ok considering you barely spend much time on the work. AND they promise payment the next day.

So I asked the Yi this question about payment and drew hexagram 63 lines 1,2,3,4 moving to hex 47.

2066,"Hi guys, I need your wise imput interpreting this reading as I am having difficulties seeing clearly lately .  I am considering various options at the moment (of how to get out of my current situation) and one strong option is to move back to live in Poland (from UK).  I know Hilary advises against asking direct questions but I just felt an urge to do it. When I asked a few days ago a more open question ""What if I try to move back to Poland?"" I got 40.5.6 to 6 (confict with my ex regarding taking my son back to Poland? although he himself said that if I don't go back with him I better move back there but I know him and that one minute he will agree to it and the next he will start causing problems and legally trying to prevent me from going, hence the more direct question).  What are your views on 40.3 line?  (I thought that if I manage to move back I might travel back to London for a while to serve my notice at work - 3 days a week - does the line advise me against dragging the past into the future?)Please help with your imput.Many thanks, Beata"
2067,"I recently got back together with my ex fiance.  We have been really cool, spending time together and seemed to have learned some new skills to make things better.  I asked the question.  Where is my relationship with her going from here and i got a 32 L 5 & 6 changing to 44.  This is a liltle confusing, from my understanding 32 means things will stay the same or to manage the change that comes.  But i think 44 means to get the hell outta here and quick.  What is the correct interpretation of this."
2068,"It seems to me that there has been a growing trend among seekers here to ask several questions  at a time concerning a situation. In my opinion this is not the best way to approach the I Ching.

It seems he won't act too well towards me if I invite him to have lunch with me. However, I don't see answers #2 and #3 as negative as answer #1. How should I make sense of the situation with these three answers? In terms of question 4:Does this mean I should speak and simply tell him that I want to talk to him face to face? Because that's where I got the idea of having lunch with him and that's where I thought maybe I should invite him to have lunch with me. However, with the answers I got from questions 1, 2, 3, I'm not sure it is a good idea I do so. So, if can't invite him to have lunch, does it mean I can only tell him I'd like to be able to sit face to face with him and talk?Thanks for your time. It's really appreciated.Lyrandra"

2072,"Okay. Here I am delicately reconstructing an budding relationship that imploded a year back. We made some positive steps this summer, but I think I blundered this week and sent out an invitation that he wasn't ready for. He responded in a timely way, but his response was a bit of a polite lie. ""Would love to meet up, but I'm heading to Europe..."" I'm all for politeness, but I'd rather have an honest response. I also value how this connection is forcing me to look at some of my less mature relating skills, so I really want to say and do the better thing here. Better= different than I've done in the past. My weekly reading for this week warned me not to fly too high/expect too much (62.2,4,6). Flexibility would be key.A little background: This person is enjoying (in professional terms) a little revival of his career, and I know he's terribly busy. He works at a VERY high level in his field (probably the reason I got the 53.6 response), and is truly a workaholic. Or at least has been. It's an exhausting existence that requires a lot of travel. Why would I find this attractive? I love his work. I was trained in this field, and though I did not stay in the field I understand it. And I like the idea of someone who isn't in my life moment by moment; my daughter consumes most of my attention and energy and I need someone who can really stand on his own and get most of emotional needs met elsewhere. I just divorced a very needy person who was not helping me develop my own independence, so I certainly don't want to go back there.And yes, I am considering whether I should just file this connection under ""It was a nice idea...""Any help?Most important thing to know about response: 53.6>39All he can do is throw me a feather now and then?Huh? Can you explain? 64.3,5,6>28How sincere was he by saying he'd love to meet up? 9.5>61Maybe not so sincere there. What effect did X intend by this message? 46did I mess up? 13.5,6>55Then I LOST all my notes in one keystroke this morning. So I took a deep breath and asked the Ching (very nicely) to give me a new reading or two.Where do I stand with X? 15.6>52What's the next best thing to do here? 49.3,4>25General diagnosis of relationship: 47 (OY.)My part: 13.2,4,5>26His part: 35Any help in giving me perspective on my next steps?

This seems to say I can find satisfaction in the future by looking in the right places (27.4 and 27.5) but not necessarily based on any hoped-for external change, as I take Hex 25 to mean that having the ""right attitude"" towards possibly unforeseen circumstances is provident.

2076,"Hello, In regard to reconciling or at least getting to harmony again with my ex, I've been concentrating on my own life and working on getting to internal harmony and growth and have not been in touch with my ex since seeing her last month to talk--which was not possible, my ex didn't want to talk then.Today, I was thinking about my ex and asked ""how can I move toward C again?"" and got 34.4>11________Nine in the fourth place means:Perseverance brings good fortune.Remorse disappears.The hedge opens; there is no entanglements.Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal of resistances, success comes in the end. the obstructions give way and all occasion for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.Such a man’s power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy loads, like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle. The less that power is applied outwardly, the greater its effect.________I'm not clear if this is saying a breakthrough is coming (in the fence) and then I can take action that will be appropriate--or I need to create a breakthrough myself? I understand hex 34 is about taking action. But the line talks of applying power inwardly, not outwardly.I also asked about ""a way to reconcile with C"" (a bit of a different question than ""moving toward"" C) and got Hex 6 unchanging which I took to mean we are in opposition--and it's troubling that it feels so ""fixed"" --like there is nothing to do/can be done. Is that the essence of 6?I also asked (last week) ""what can I expect (with C) if I let C know how much this means to me to reconcile? and got 19.1.2>2 Which sounds pretty positive, and for me to remain receptive, not in the lead with this-- but I'm honestly at odds about how and when to do something like that-- because in our last interaction, C was quite angry with me and from my point of view, not in a mood to hear from me nor communicate with me--at least not now. And I felt pretty put off by her response and some of the things she said in anger. So, I've left the ball in her court and refrained from any contact and any intention toward C (also due to a prior reading that had hex 60 in it).Any help with these recent readings? My head tells me to leave her be, yet I still want to clear up the misunderstandings, heal things between us, and if possible, reconcile at some point--maybe as friends first and then go from there, I'm not sure.I would love any insights from those here.Thank you all, many blessings.:bows:"
2077,"A question was asked regarding an application to program A.""What are the prospects of admission?""50.1.3>38I am wondering how do you read that?

Because of certain other issues I gladly decided to fold the business in early September and look for new opportunities now that I'm feeling so much better. I've been very drawn in the last two weeks to clear clutter from our home and actually have done very little about looking for something else.Given that my question wasn't 'what is going to happen this week', I'm a little puzzled about how to interpret the reading.

I am willing to put up with this it stabilise's my business  and helps it grow with lower overheads.Maybe the yI was saying yes but its like another person taking up space so this is the downsidethe person would not be as skilled because it would be hard to find someone like him i would be waiting for ever if i was that picky.I would plan to train them and they would learn from him, the reason I asked the Yi is that i was concerened about cash flow and was slightly worried about the repercussions  and also dont want be left to start again when he leavesPlease feel free to add commentsCheers everyoneSteve"

2085,"Hey all,This is my first time posting here, but I've utilized the forums quite a bit in gaining greater clarity concerning the meaning of my readings.Anywho, I've been down for a while. It's my last year of college, I have a very vague idea of where I'm going in life, and I've been having trouble getting over a botched relationship with someone I've been close to for years. I don't do this often, but instead of a straightforward question to the I Ching, I wrote about a paragraph sincerely expressing my doubts and feelings, which was essentially summed up by saying: I'm depressed and aimless and I wanna get back on track. My question was phrased, How can I best correct these complaints? I received hexagram 27, with lines 1, 4, 6 changing. It seemed like a fairly auspicious reading, but I just wanted to ask you all what your analysis was of this situation, and what the meaning of it changing to 'Enthusiasm' might mean.

Having looked at both our horoscopes for 2010, it appeared that the relationship might end in 2010, but I was not sure, so I asked the I Ching for clarification. ""Will we break up in 2010?""  My guess is yes, since Return can mean ""return to the path,"" and this particular diversion is a dead end.  Following speaks to the strength of this attraction.What do you think? 17.  Following.  Supreme success.  Perseverance furthers.  No blame.17.4: Following brings success.  Perseverance creates misfortune.  To go one's way with sincerity brings clarity.  How could there be blame in this?17.5: Sincere in the good.  Good fortune.24.  Return.  Going out and coming in without error.  Friends come without blame.  To and fro goes the way.  On the seventh day comes return.  It furthers one to have somewhere to go."
2089,"Yes, yes, it me again, back with my old little bag of problems.  Still trying to find a way to break free.  I will do it eventually, I know, the question is how and.... well how.  Back in June I think I posted a question on how to break free (from my ex partner, who doesn't want to let go and who is also a father of my child) and I got back then Hex 19 unchanging.  Some time and effort has passed (there were plans to move up north from London to create physical distance from him that never actually materialised) and it seems like not much has changed since, apart from the fact that I cannot really take this situation for much longer (his constant begging mixed with threats to give this relationship one last go for the sake of keeping the family together).  So back to my good old question, this time slightly rephrased: ""How do I deal with X to be able to trully break free""?.  I got hex 19.3.4 to 34.  I think I got the jest of if, i.e. the time of change is approaching, I must not get too settled into what's left of the comfort zone but stick to what I believe is right, and not wait too long to act (but is hex 19 advising me to act or kind of follow the natural path of events).  If I persevere with my beliefs then my regrets will vanish and a time of great power will approach (which I must not overuse, i.e. hurt people along the way, which might indicate perhaps making sure that my ex will always have access to our son??)  Please let me have your thoughts on this, I know I have been going on about it for months but Im finding it really hard (for various reasons).  Have I got the interpretation right?  Have I missed anything important??  Does anyone have any more thoughts on Hex 34 in this reading?I would really appreciate your comments on this.Many thanks!XXX"

Instead, he invited me elsewhere tomorrow, a much less informal event.Should I go tomorrow, at risk of seeming too availabke/desperate?I ching said: 27.5 -> 42 (nourishment changing to increase).I want to see him, but this is someone ""attracted to the figure of the receding woman"" as Agatha Christie said.

2093,"How would you read this? Two readings about a relationship that seemed to be going well and increasing in intensity, but then one person stopped contacting the other for no apparent reason, after constant contact.  After a few days of silence, the question was asked: ""Is this silence a sign their interest is waning?""Hexagram 20 (Contemplation/View) with changing lines 2 and 5 --> Hexagram 4 (Innocence).Interpreted this to mean that the person was silent because of issues more weighty than the relationship (line 5), and not to take this personally (line 2).  Hexagram 4 says: ""Don't act like an adolescent!""The following day (still no contact), the question was asked: ""How to best handle this strange breaking off of contact and revive the relationship?""Hexagram 28 (Preponderance of the Great) with line 2 changing --> Hexagram 31 (Influence/Wooing)Interpreted this to mean that the relationship would be renewed in time (line 2) and increase in intensity (Hexagram 31)."

I felt our relationship was too emtionally tumultous, and I didnt want to return to the old ways, so I just backed off. I wanted to know, how did he feel about my withdrawal? I don't know what it really means. But the resuting hexagram is 8, so it sounds like he wants a union?When I want to get closer to him, he backs off, so I have decided to give up on it for a while. But what happens is he probably tries to get closer. But I am still very confused.Thanks if anyone can help."
2095,"a fel in love and ofcourse would like to know if there is the possibility of having a relationship with this person.""What can the IC tell me about the possibility of having a relationship with this guy""?The answer was hex 45 unchanged which to me was a bit confusing because this guy in person lives on the land where people gather to gether as a temporary community. The answer 45 by its self sounds very just and clear and to the point but it didn't say something 'special' about -us-...So I ask the question again and with the only difference that now I asked:""What can the IC tell me about the possibility of having a loverelationship with this man.And got hex 41.3.4 changing to 14..?Last edited: Oct 7, 2009"

2099,"I asked the question ""what is my greatest fault that hinders me from following the correct path?  63.5.6 to 22  I'm thinking in terms of spirituality and self development, of being, as Yi says, the superior man (well, woman in this case).I am unclear as to the message here.  Line 5 is often about not being sincere or I have also seen it as valuing superficial over substance, neither of which I think applies to me, but then maybe I don't have a clear picture of myself.  Could it just be saying I value the wrong things, or that I put too much into something, see more than there is, when a simpler approach or view would suffice?Line 6 I see as dwelling too much on the past or possibly reveling too much in your achievements, or maybe being too sure of oneself because of past successes.  There is a story that always makes me think of this line about a man who gets across a dangerous bridge and is looking back at the peril through which he has come only to stub his toe on a rock that is right in front of him.  I can see this applying to a couple of particular situations but not to me overall or as a general rule.  In fact, I am usually very unsure of myself, questioning everything I do, every decision I make, reviewing everything six ways to Sunday.  The other problem I have in a response like this is seeing the whole picture.  Its the same problem I have in Tarot.  I can often see the meaning of individual lines (or cards) but not how they work together, I have trouble unifying them into a single answer.  Of course, with changing lines, there isnt always a unified answer, they can sometimes be different steps to take or alternative choices.  But with a question like this, unless I have two faults that tie for the greatest, not entirely implausible, then the hex and lines work together to form a single answer, and I am being obtuse.  Any thoughts?  And dont worry about offending me; I never ask questions I don't want the answer to, even if that answer is painful or something I don't want to hear.  Then again, maybe that's why I am having so much trouble interpreting this"
2100,"Hello fellow I-CHINGers! As a beginner I kindly request the benefit of your wisdom & experience. I've been in a relationship for almost 6 years now and living together for the past 8 months. We are very bonded and do love each other, but my overall feeling is one of borderline unhappiness and discomfort as I realize that we are not really compatible in our values, priorities and lifestyles.  I frequently feel trapped and wish to be free of this bond but I am held back by my caring for this man which is profound and not to be lightly dismissed. I am upset over a recent quarrel as we are not speaking to each other at the moment so my question was: What should I expect if I break up with x now? The answer was: Hex. 42 with changing lines 2 & 5 changing to hexagram 41. I feel the I Ching is telling me that a break-up (the decrease ) will be very beneficial ( increase) to me. Is that so? Furthermore, I am mystified by the changing lines and the nuances of the answer esp. as they refer to tortoises (line 2) and kindness in ones heart ( line 5). Can you please help me with a more detailed interpretation... before I act on what could be a half-baked understanding of the advice given? Much appreciated!"

2102,"Hello all. I'm new here, just signed up today, and have spent a few hours browsing through Hilary's fine set of resources. And now I'm ready to post a request for help with a reading.background:I'm going through a serious transition internally: from a phase of deep and almost paralysing anxiety and grief into a more productive relationship with myself and my immediate world. And it's going well, really: many challenges, but many resources to bring to bear. Still, I'm finding my daily experience one filled with fear, anxiety and strong self-judgment. I'm working with these feelings while also sustaining an active and demanding job.question as written:Will I be able to understand and calm the anger, fear, anxiety and judgment within me-to make myself whole? How?reading:primary: 47, with moving lines at 4 and 5.secondary: 7thoughts and problems:47 makes perfect sense, and describes my current situation with typically sharp but sympathetic accuracy. the line readings also make complete sense to me. But 7 is a bit . . . enigmatic. My wife points to the existence of a war within me, and the availability of resources to conduct that war, with the hexagram suggesting the need for kind but firm discipline in marshalling those inner resources: water under earth, in several of the translations I'm using. Hilary's text (http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/learn/gua/hexagrams/hexagram7.php) suggests a taking of personal responsibility in a time of focused, intense inner struggle, and a grim situation: that too makes good sense.Still I'm still at sea with the connection between 47 and 7 . . . I'd welcome any thoughts.Thanks in advance for any help, and for creating what seems to be such a welcoming community,Alexmethod: yarrow stalks (traditional)translations: Wilhelm/Baynes; Wang Bi/Lynn; Huang"
2103,"Since I was present for the session, I suppose I ought to know. But reiki is such a mystery to me, that I wanted to ask. Yes, I felt a kind of warmth radiating through parts of my body, and even though it was a distance session (the practitioner was not present), I thought I could feel a specific change when the session began.I've only once received a reading with all lines changing, which was a shock. So this reading, with 5 lines changing was equally shocking --and rare. I don't feel like a different person, and yet quite a lot seemed to have gone on. My DNA seems to be intact still!Anyone with reiki experience want to help me decode this one? It's probably very simple. "

It has been bliss, and we have both been very happy and delighted with each other, but circumstances have also made it difficult. Sadly, we had a parting of the ways last week. I have not been clear on whether or not it is permanent. Today I asked the yi, can you give me some insight into our situation? Resulting in 21.2 -> 38.... yikes! Freaked out and not understanding, I asked, What can I do to help us to reunite? This resulted in 19.2 -> 24 which looks pretty darn positive.What do you make of these two together?

2115,"Hello,I'm new here and I wanted to ask a clarification about an I-Ching reading.I recently had my birthday, but the person I always considered to be my best female friend didn't remember of my birthday, didn't phone, didn't e-mailed me, didn't message me, even though she already knew what was my birthday day, and she was around the whole time, even in the day.  Actually, she was acting ""distant"" from me since about a week before.When one of my male friends came to give me greetings for my birthday, I commented to him: ""You were the only one who remembered, she (my female friend) apparently didn't care.""This male friend told around other persons that she, my best female friend, wasn't really my friend in spite of all the affection she ever showed to me, and I replied with a ""laughing"" (sarcasm) when my male friend repeated to the people the once nice words my female friend used to tell me.My female friend knew about that and she got upset at me.  She said she missed remembering my birthday because she was concerned about some other event that was taking place about someone else in her family, and she showed me her grief because I made fun with my male friend of some nice words she told me once.The detail is: this male friend doesn't like my female friend much.  And, after a whole day, I realised he maybe only wanted to intrigue me with my female friend.Then I send her a message saying that I was sorry for having being stupid to her for her being unable to remember of my birthday and I said also, ""if you won't want me as friend any more, I wanted to tell you that it was nice to have ever known you"".I played the I-Ching in search of some light... I asked the I-Ching ""What was my female friend do about me now?""The answers from the I-Ching were: The Hexagram 5, changing into the Hexagram 59.  From what I could see, all that talking about ""clouds from the west"" didn't give me much hope.  I admit I know very few about the I-Ching though.This female friend is not anyone I have sexual/romantical interest, she's taken.  She's just someone I like too much and I feel sad about the possibility that I lost her friendship.Thank everyone in advance."

I am typically very protective of my career life vs. my private life, to the point where I haven't shared my surname with him -- we meet when I visit his town on weekends.

I asked the Yi 'what will the consequences be if I share more personal information with him', and received 39.4.5.6>56.

These are the answers I received. If anyone has some thoughts about my interpretations I would be very grateful to hear your wisdom.Thanks. And these were my questions to the Oracle:55.1.3.5 > 35What can I expect from X?This seems positive I think. 55.1 - mentions that to proceed brings honor, 55.3 - inspiration? 55.5 - Recognition comes, bringing reward and praise. Also if this changes to 35 it sounds quite good too. Does this mean he is being drawn towards me?49 unchangingWhat sort of man is he?This is a little more puzzling. What is the skinning about? Does it mean he is making big life changes or revolution which sounds a bit more sinister.18.4.6 > 32What are his intentions towards me?This sounded darker especially 18.4 which refers to the father. He told me his dad died when he was a teenager. Although I'm not sure how this relates to me. Maybe in the behaviour patterns he has acquired? And 32 'Steady the helm of the heart.' This sounds quite nice. RespectfullyPetal"
2126,"We're having a rough start to the school year here. My seven year old daughter has Asperger's Syndrome and attends a multi-aged gifted classroom where she actually has a lot of freedom to chose what she wants to learn. While some things are improving (she's taking Tenex and staying on task more often), we're still struggling at home and at school with talking back and defiant behavior --often over (seemingly) trivial causes. This is nothing new; my girl has from the start had her own idea of reality and doesn't much cater to anyone else's. For instance, she doesn't see the point in wearing clothes. Sigh. And for those of you who are astro-savvy: she has five planets, POF, and Ceres in Aquarius, Moon in Gemini, Mars in Aries, Pluto in Sag. Libra rising. I call her the Friendly Anarchist.She is utterly an autodidact, and I'm tempted to home school here, but she's also an only child and my circumstances right now don't support homeschooling here.

What's the primary reason she's uncooperative at school? 60.3,5,6-26If I had to read this as advice, I'd say the Yi is reminding me that setting limits is necessary to her long-term development. But I asked WHY she's uncooperative.I asked Bradford for a look at this because I was really moved by his thoughts on being an adult with Asperger's. So Brad, if you were the parent of an Aspie kid, what would you recommend for this reading? The need to please others is not a primary motivator, so her teacher's appeals/tricks/warnings fall on disinterested ears.Any thoughts from the crew here would be appreciated. We meet with her teachers on Monday for a conference."
2127,"Hi all,I have a few questions. Thanks in advance for your help!I asked:1. How will he act with me if I send him this (X)  message? 51.3.6 > 302. How will he act with me if I ignore him? 22 > 223. What does he want from me? 11 > 114. How is he going to act with me tomorrow? 61.1.3.4 > 44------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Is it good or bad? It seems like he will be shocked, but I'm not sure if it's in a good way or bad way? In the message I want to send him, I just basically ask him why he sends me e-mails when he knows how I feel about him. I ask also what does he want from me. He just wants to be friends? He just wants to talk? He just wants be nice? I say that I would like to keep talking to him, but that maybe we could set the record straight so that everything is clear. Maybe it's too much?2. I don't really know how to relate this one I must say.3. Is there more to peace than just... peace? He just wants to have a good relationships with me, that's it?Thanks,LyrandraLast edited: Sep 25, 2009"

The future's almost bleak as the present, and its like ive already made a wrong move by choosing the direction I want to take. I really am not sure I should trust my gut but that was what I am doing. Its not very realistic, however, but I still continued.I asked, can u offer me some advice about my life, study or career goals?I got 53.2>57. It reads like a very encouraging hexagram; does it mean I will finally have some movement in regards to my plans? Does it also advise listening to my intuition? I really hope its good and a soon thing."
2129,"Hello everyone,Wondering if I could get some help on this reading:What is the main lesson I need to be aware of, relating to my grandmother (and how she lived her life and related to others)?33.1,4,5 : 22Background: she didn't have an easy time of it but was a very proud fun-loving person, though made the biggest mistakes in her relationships.My initiall impression of this reading was retreat from superficiality ie. retreat from going to great lengths to try and project a certain image? Or be aware that life is what it is - and not to try so hard to be perfect and follow an ideal?Any ideas very welcome.I also have something else I'd like to share - I finished my supply serotonin-encouraging 5HTP and have noticed a change in the past couple of days without them (namely feeling sad). I have now started on the traditional herbal remedy for depression called St.John's Wort - to see how they compare.My question was: Is my present-moment sinking feeling due to a chemical/hormonal imbalance? 2.1,2 > 19My interpretation here is that line 1 says I need to watch this tendency and not allow it to turn into a slippery slope (perhaps by not dwelling on these feelings) and line 2 - It's just the way I was made? Or natural to feel down? And could Hex 19 be saying that if I approach myself and the good opportunities (which I know I am lucky to have at the mo) with reception and faith - and dedication - I can  make up for this, perhaps natural, tendency to depression?One final question that I could use help on although I think I get it (though not the relating hex):Am I to live without (a certain person)?11.4,6 > 14My take - there was sincerity and trust (line 4) but that was lost (line 6)... is the possession the lesson I've learnt? Or potential between us if there's mutual understanding? I know I really need to learn here, not to be so dependent on relationships which are inevitably subject to change...Thanks for reading!:bows:"

2131,"Hi Guys, I have not posted for a while... Im still sitting on my life's little fence, scared to jump off.  I feel like I am unable to move forward unless I make a very difficult decision in my life, which scares the living light out of me.  I know I have to do it, previous threads suggest I have to do it, Hilary says (cries, begs) I have to do it and I still cannot do it.  The decision requires making a clear cut with my ex and arranging for visitations of my son, that is starting to share him at alternative weekends and half the holidays.  I am petrified of making that step so I keep prodding along, making false promises to my ex, driving to his house every weekend so I can always be with my son.  During the week my ex comes over whenever he wants to, tells me that I should be thinking about my son and that I should be getting back with him.  I have no life.  Yet I am apparently incapable for breaking out of that viscious circle.  So.... I have asked ""How do I find a way (and strength) to break free?""  I got hexagram 16.6 changing to 35.  As a background, even before I had my son and met my ex, I always used to observe the people who split when there were children involved and think what a nightmare that might be for them and especially for the children, an absolute nightmare.  I come from a traditional catholic upbringing and very much value the family unit.  I always thought that people should do everything, once they have children, to keep the family together, yet I am now in a position where I find it very very difficult to do that.  I feel so angry and frustrated, why is God punishing me like that?  What lesson am I suppose to learn from it?  I look at my little boy and just want to cry each time he asks for his Daddy.  I am scared of making the wrong move so I keep sitting on my fence.  Seeing my life pass me by.  I need some help here, please help me find a way and the strength to break free and out of this nightmare."
2132,"Hi my friends,Since I didn't want to ask a ""yes or no"" question, I asked the IC the following question in order to determine if I should do it or not:How will he act with me if I ask him the question I want to ask him? 53.6 > 39I want to know if I should ask him my question or not. Because of the hexagram 39, I'm not sure I should. It seems that 53.6 is somehow positive, but it also seems that 39 is not. So, should I ask him my question or not?Thank you for your help,Lyrandra"
2133,"I asked what should I do with all this X (a old hobby of mine done over the years)?It said 11 - > 4911 sounds goodLine 2 however seems to talk bout letting go of friends and moving on - move on and let go of the old source of accumulation? Not isolating myself to a clique of people on the behalf of what i've accumulated?Does say to ford the river with resolution - so I suppose it means not throwing it away but at the same time move on - (take my hobby with me to a new city?) Not be un-circumpsect in the matter? Line 4 - don't boast of my hobby? Seems pretty clear - remain humble. Line 5 - I dunno what it's setting here but an ideal to strive for. Being humble even when in a high position and uniting with those of lesser ""rank"". Then 49 seems to speak of a violent revolt. Throwing something off. Getting rid of the old. Uh... So is it advising I quit with accumulating at this place and move on - Perhaps not abandoning what i'm associated with (11.2) but changing directions with it. This is in inquiry to an old hobby of mine. (same as thread : http://www.onlineClarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=8630 )This question is also about moving to a new city (as such giving up this hobby where I am)So I also asked: What about returning to X (to visit) when I come back to the city? Gave me hexagram 49 unchanging. Seems to talk again about getting rid of the old. ---Please keep in mind I threw this divination before asking about giving this same hobby:http://www.onlineClarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=8630----I know this is allot to ask but if someone could help me with these i'd appreciate it."

I am the kind of person who prefers to keep a low profile and I do not cope well with stress and pressure at work.I asked the I Ching what was the right attitude to have toward this new job and I got:Hex 58.3,4,5 > 11 My interpretation of the reading was a confirmation that the job is not right but I am not really sure that this is the correct interpretation.  Maybe I need to stay with it for now?I then asked whether I should go part-time (I can afford it) and spend more time on myself and my hobbies.  I have this yearning to find a way to express myself creatively but this does not come easy either, so I was thinking of joining an art class to help me develop that side of me.  I got:Hex 51.4,5 > 3I can see that the I Ching picks up on my fears and blockages but I do not understand whether it is supportive of the idea to go part-time.Your comments and insights would be much appreciated.

2138,"Hello all!I'd like to hear people's ideas on Hex 37. I have drawn it a lot lately in regard to feeling discouraged about feeling isolated and uninspired. I could see this as a call to find my own people, but then what's the difference from 13?LiSe speaks of it almost as a union of necessity, and others seem to confirm it as creating a support structure within a group where everyone fulfills their designated role. But outside of the most traditional concept of family, which may be relevant for me, I don't get other possible implications.Thanks in advance."
2139,Hi Allthanks again to everyone that helped with this issue as it has been dirving me a little crazy as to what I was going to do.I asked the Yi is it WISE to get a passport in mothers maiden name which in response i recieved28.4>48I took this as there is no harm as long as  it is not abused but the problem is in reality if i was to obtain a passport in my mothers maiden name i would most likely need bank accounts etc so it would all matchso the answer i felt there maybe no harm in obtaining the passport but what about the rest of itWould be interested if anybody sees something I may be missingI then asked should obtain the passport in my current name then funny enough i recieved 59.5>4 which i thought was almost eerie as my first question on the maiden name was 59.6.29 in my first threadYou could almost take this as try with your current name first .I felt the answer in general was pretty much saying yes continue and you will have a break throughLike a fever peakingSo in conclusion I think all the answers were helpful but at the end of the day I am the querrent and I feel to me 59.5 was easier to analyse compared to 59.6just keep waiding through the swamp and i will eventually reach land. The only other thing I can add and felt from the reading there is no reason why I couldnt get a passport in the maiden name in the future if I ever wanted.Please comment if you disagree or see something I dont on these readingslike i mentioned i need this soughted and I do want to make the correct decisionI think the correct question would have been am i on the correct path currently in obtaining my passport.I really need to get the question right the first time.Thanks again Steve.:bows:

2141,"Hi again everybody! Hi Willowfox! I have been bussy lately and I miss you all.Many things and changes are ocurring in my life.An old friend came a week ago to the city where I live. She is willing to open a business and she is offering a partnership to me and I don't know what to do as for the moment I have a lot of oportunities, interesting job offers and a lot of work; a lot of thinking and I am making important decisions. I am adjusting my life to these changes and -by the way- wonderful times. Most of them are already developing. But this particular one, is bothering me.   My friend and I had a very superficial friendship, so I don't really know her. Our kids were classmates and friends and that's how we started our friendship. We haven't seen each other like for eleven years  But... there is something that I don't get quite clear. It is a feeling of discomfort and doubt. Through our conversations and by observing her I got a feeling that I cannot understand. Shame on me but I don't trust her... And I don't have the courage to tell her this, not even think there could be a way to say to her such a thing. I asked the I Ching ""what if I accept to open a business with XX? the answer is hex 3. lines 1 and 2 Should I ask more? I mean in different ways or this is enough.

2143,"I have an idea for a book I'd like to write. It's a scary time to be a writer, of course, with the publishing industry in such bad shape, and so while I'm excited about the idea, I'm also feeling cautious. So I asked two questions:What would come to me from writing this book proposal? 46.2 to 15Will it sell? 61.1,3,5,6 to 46Here are my thoughts on those:46 -> 15 Hard to read the line as anything but positive. The question to me is whether 15 is advice about how to approach things as I go (stay humble and modest, don't get carried away), or whether it's more directly about what will come to me (the experience will flay my ego and teach me humility).61 -> 46. I hear this as saying, ""Write it from your heart, and things will grow. Watch out for crowing too much; stay carefully grounded. And there are no guarantees."" I'm a little concerned that the two most unambiguously positive lines are the ones I *didn't* get. The general sense of 61 -- being centered and connected to the spirits, bringing the inner reality to the outer world -- is exactly what I want to be doing with my writing. And I want to bring it about through the grounded, step-by-step work of 46. But I'm not sure that necessarily adds up to it selling.Two more:What impact will this have on my career? 1.1,5,6 to 32What sort of emotional impact will it have on me career-wise? 2.3,5 to 39.Boy, I don't know. This all sounds an awful lot like I'll have a great time writing it, it won't sell, it'll be really hard emotionally, it'll require perseverance to move beyond it, though it will also unleash some powerful forces, both masculine and feminine ones. Might should do it, but it's intimidating.Any thoughts are most appreciated."
2144,"Hello, I made attempts to smooth things over with my ex toward reunion this weekend. Our meeting was quite strained and brief--my ex was angry and harsh, saying she had decided to move on and was now with a new person--that 4 months had passed and what else did I expect. My ex didn't want to talk much past that and our meeting was cut short due to her angry mood--and the new person was apparently there, waiting inside. This was not a happy situation, all around. From this, I saw that my ex has lots of angry feelings about things still--something I could not have seen unless we met in person. I left feeling quite bad and have taken time to step back from the situation and feel my feelings and detach to get broader perspective. This is someone I care deeply and genuinely about. My heart and intuition is what told me to go to my ex. I shared that with my ex. There is more I want to share, if my ex wants to go forward with me at some point.

We agreed that this seperation was temporary but due to her history I have my doubts so I asked the question (does she truly intend to come back to the relationship) and I got an 8 L1, L3 & L6 changing to 37.

Then regretted it when he told me he had no intention of breaking it off and cleared up the misunderstanding. When I apologized for my actions told him my feelings and asked to continue he refused by telling me that he was not interested in continuing with me at this point and blocked every communcations with me. Your answer:Is my love relationship with N permanently finished? Hexagram 37 line 6 changing 63Lets say for the moment at least, so a lot depends upon you now, you need to be patient for a start, you need to show the good side of yourself and you need to shine quite brilliantly, then with a bit of hope and goodwill, he may feel the urge to start again.I decided to follow your advise.  I found a way to unblock myself and sent him the following email:""I know you're shocked for getting this. What happened I thought you were my friend? You really hurt my feelings by blocking me. I would never block you or ignore you or intentionally hurt you. I don't treat people like that. When someone needs my support I would try to rectify things and offer my support even if that person is a stranger. It's sad when two intelligent people of like mind and heart end up like this. You deleted blocked me and next. I would have never done that to you. If you still think about me here's my number xxx. No need to block me. I'm not neurotic or a stalker. I'm a beautiful woman. I don't even have your number anymore. Kisses xxx""He did not block me or delete me this time but after reading the message kept it in his inbox. I sent it August 1/09.

For example, the answer to my first question. He can't be doing that because he wants to split apart from me. He just wouldn't send me e-mails if that was the case, right?

While some things are improving (she's taking Tenex and staying on task more often), we've still struggling at home and at school with talking back and defiant behavior. This is nothing new; my girl has from the start had her own idea of reality and doesn't much cater to anyone else's. For instance, she doesn't see the point in wearing clothes. Sigh. And for those of you who are astro-savvy: she has five planets, POF, and Ceres in Aquarius, Moon in Gemini, Mars in Aries, Pluto in Sag. Libra rising.

Maybe in middle school... So we've got to work with what's available now: the public school GT program.SO. What's the primary reason she's uncooperative at school? 60.3,5,6-26If I had to read this as advice, I'd say the Yi is reminding me that setting limits is necessary to her long-term development. But I asked WHY she's uncooperative.I asked Bradford for a look at this because I was really moved by his thoughts on being an adult with Asperger's. So Brad, if you were the parent of an Aspie kid, what would you recommend for this reading? The need to please others is not a primary motivator, so her teacher's appeals/tricks/warnings fall on disinterested ears.Any thoughts from the crew here would be appreciated. We meet with her teachers on Monday for a conference."
2156,"Hello all,Need some help with an interpretation because I don't really think I trust myself to be impartial enough anymore. And since I think I'm kinda psychotic right now, please, someone help point me in the right path?I've just returned from overseas to my homeland. I've been away for the last 2 years and upon return, find that my bf of 5 years is somewhat different. Colder, indifferent. Well, I thought maybe coz I've just returned, we need some time to warm up again. But it's been almost a month since I've got back, and things have not improved.And then I find myself having thoughts of breaking up coz there seems no point. And yet, can't bear to. So I'll been vacillating between continuing and terminating the relationship. Truth me told, I've been shedding more tears then I like alone in bed over his aloofness and my dilemma. And so has my emotions, between despair and hope. This is where I start getting psychotic and start hoping Iching can point me the way.I just asked a series of 3 questions. Qn:What is the situation of the relationship between me and X now?An:6 → 12Qn:I am extremely tired of my relationship with X now. Is it worth it to continue our relationship?An:18 → 64Qn:How much does X still wants to be in a relationship with me now?An:19 → 59The first 2, I can interprete, but it's the last that throws me off. The individual lines sounds optimistic enough, and yet, if I just take the Hexagrams, it seems to say ""Approaching (Hex 19)"" ""Dispersion (Hex 59)"". And yet if you take the 1st 2 questions by itself, it seems to tell me to say ""Goodbye"".Help please? I'd be very very very grateful to anyone's take on this set of questions. :bows:"
2157,"I'm in a job where there is a lot of maneuvering for attention. I work best in an office culture where the work is collaborative, but it honestly feels at time that my desire to share credit works is treated as a weakness by others who are more than happy to claim the limelight, and exclude my contributions. Honestly I'm annoyed that I think about this at all, as it detracts from my sense of purpose about the very meaningful work that I do. But perhaps divine providence has put me here to help develop healthy boundaries? Or  in contrast, to keep my eyes on the prize and trust that the right will be revealed in the end?I asked for ""guidance around struggles for status in the workplace"" and got Hex 8 with line 6 changing to Hex 20. Okay, so this means that I should continue to share credit no matter what and not worry about about the questionable integrity of others? I'd really like it to be this...Thanks in advance!"
2158,"hi everyone,I've had the most unusual reading regarding a health issue last night and I'm trying to understand if I should be worried about it or not . .I had one of my lovely headaches yesterday (ahem). It lasted throughout the whole day but since it was of a more or less bearable intensity I didn't pay much attention -I'm quite used to them and I only take medication when they incapacitate me. I avoided coffee, drank a lot of water and went to sleep expecting to wake up ok. Instead of that though, I woke up around 5 in the morning with a pounding head . . I wondered how I would be able to show up for work like that and asked Yi -what was causing this, to which I got a 2.5 to 8 next thing I know, the headache is getting even worse and making me sick to my stomach,  reaching its peak the way usually stomach sickness does . . Now I'm getting a bit panicky and ask -what's going on? . . 34.5 (that is a line I always get in definitely not well situations, I honestly can't see any easiness in it!!)Anyway, after that things calmed down and I went through my day ok, but coming back I thought I'd try to understand a bit more my first reading. Now Yi gave me a couple of answers that really played with my mind -I could see them going both ways- until I asked -am I seriously physically compromised? . . 59and-was I over-worrying thinking there's sth seriously wrong? . . 40.1,3 to 34Rosada, I remember you had the same answer concerning your father's moving house and I'm wondering how this turned out for you . .If anyone has any insight on how a 2.5 can be related to acute physical pain, I'd love to read them . . this is still puzzling . .thank you!"
2159,"After reading a post here regarding Hex 31 and dreams, I was prompted to ask IC something similar...I have very strong feelings for an ex b/f from a very long time ago.  I've always had the hunch that we would most likely end up together again at some point, but have not pursued this relationship.  Lately, I've had a plethora of dreams with this man in them.  Sometimes he's a critical character in the dream, sometimes, he's just ""there"" for whatever else is going on in the dream, some of the dreams are feel-good, some are filled with anxiety, etc, etc...but he's been showing up pretty regularly in them.  Which prompted me to do a little investigating into the current circumstances and I was disappointed to hear that he has recently started dating someoneI asked IC for insight into my connection with this man and received Hex 41, lines 1, 3, and 5 changing to Hex 57.  Hex 41 indicates diminishing?  That's not what I hoped to hear  However, lines 1, 3, and 5 seem somewhat positive.  Interesting line 3 speaks of one person of three leaving to go off on their own(but I suppose it probably means me, as HE'S the one dating someone now).......and 5 speaks of positive omens, I think?I would be grateful for additional thoughts or insight on this reading!!~Namaste~:bows:"
2160,"as is usually the case, my querying of the oracle followed dreams that became too powerful and too specific to ignore. i have called them the Mystery Blonde dreams, and have had them for a few years now, though very recently the mystery seems to be peeling away somewhat. some background: i met ""her"" (not a dream) almost a quarter-century ago. suffice to say, she made quite an impression on me. (yes, she's blonde.) as sometimes happens in life, though, the timing was not the best. ships passing in the night, bound for different lands. obviously, i never forgot her. back to the dreams. in the most recent, i am walking and then turn around, prompted to do so by nothing more than a feeling. and there she is, having been following me. (or is simply there when i turn.) we make eye contact - the instant recognition(though there is now a streak of grey in her hair) - and the dream ends. i then began the search. to see, first, if i could locate her. i did, and dropped a simple 'hello, remember me?"" note on a classmates page. i have no idea how long she's had it up there, or whether she even checks it. but, it seemed, the least i can do. (and the most that i will do, given the fact she seems to be married.)   (these dreams, in fact, have shown the Mystery Blonde to be married, to a husband who acts, in the dreams anyway, to be tired of her. she's ""old,"" etc.; and in the most recent he more or less hands off/tosses her to me. then i wake.) so, i approach the oracle and inquire about the situation, how/whether to proceed. hexagram 31.  suffice to say, after reading the initial and then subsequent interpretations, i'm...well...intrigued.  i feel also that the proper course is to let the classmates note, innocuous as it is, be the extent to which i proceed. (for that matter, a conservative, yielding approach - being open to what is and what is not - seems to me to be advised in the hexagram.)   i welcome any thoughts on this, of course, but have dropped this here also because of the sheer power of the hexagram when it came to me."
2161,"Hi, Sorry to bother everyone again. I think I need help again. I'm still learning to read the advice from the IC. And I like seeing other people's point of view as well. I asked:How is he going to act with me tomorrow? 17.1.2.5 > 40I am not sure about the changing lines. I think I'm clearly the leader in the situation and he is the follower. In line 1, it talks about going after others. But it talks about more than one person. That's where I'm confused. In line 2, it is clear, except I have a hard time relating it to my question/situation. In line 5, it talks about following the right path. Maybe ""following me"" is the wrong path to take?Any advice?Thanks,Lyrandra"

2163,"Hey!I've been doing some readings about a certain someone (let's call her X) and most of them are here on the forum (and thank you all for you explanations, I tend to be too negative and see only the bad side of things, even Yi).Anyways, recently I decided to deal with the ""root of the problem"" in my relationship with her, therefore I asked ""Where do my insecurities in my relationship with X come from?"" (a pretty big question IMHO) and I got 13.3 > 25, now I see this as my insecurities coming from ""friends"" (I'd dare say her other male friends) and maybe me mistrusting some of them, however line 3 says something about hiding weapons and not being able to act in three years, please somebody tell me that's not true!!

2164,"Hello all.  I am working to take the right steps to improve my situation as quickly as possible, as events last night made it clear that I am still not safe where I am and I am here because I fled an unsafe situation in another state.  I want to be able to live in another place, but for the moment the room that I am in is the only one for which I will get Public Assistance approval and I am simply not safe here.  They key to my turn around at this point in time is perseverance and money.  I have been persevering for so long, I don't know that I feel very strong about it anymore, but I recently became enlivened about a prospect I discovered in a conversation started with me by a woman whom I had never before met.  I posted about that on an other thread this morning [I don't know how to set a link for it here it's entitled, ""6.2.4.5>23 and 1.1.5>50 getting Fin Aid and getting into Massage School""], asking specifically about being able to actually successfully enroll in massage school at this time and get fin aid for it.  I am grateful for the response I got from willowfox.  It seems, however, unless anyone has a different perspective, that I will not be able to realize this goal in the current enrollment schedule which is now, through January for schools in NYS and NJ.  willowfox estimates a time of around next May being when things open up for me in this arena.  I must be making active changes well before then, as I want to see my situation change for the better immediately.  So, I asked the Yi, Q: What are my options for most quickly gaining financial independence? 16.2.4>7 = “Enthusiasm The Army”I would appreciate  insights into what the Yi is telling me here, and if possible any additional insights into my other positing.  As I said there, I have been helped by you over the passed two years since I discovered this site and the I Ching.  I have drafted numerous first postings, but I never submitted one until now.  I want to do more than survive, I want to thrive.  But, I truly fear for my safety again, just a few short weeks after having made a life-changing choice to save my life.  I am struggling to find my way into the paths that god has opened for me.  I cannot believe that I am meant to endure this living situation for any length of time, as it is in all practical senses a repeat of what I just endured for over two years and which, when I fought back against, forced me to choose between justice and remaining alive.  The only way it will change is either with a sudden influx of money or with a change of situation that entails a change of residence, like being enrolled in school, or a call from someone at DSS about a unique opportunity that miraculously popped into creation and they thought of me right away to snatch it up.   What do you see this as telling me are my options?  I will follow where I am led, but I cannot see a path right now as EVERY plan I have undertaken for the passed three years has been met with blocks that are dangerous and threatening to overcome, forcing me right back into a situation of having to take someone on or to fight back and demand correction from a higher authority.  And I am not safe here.  I must change my situation and I cannot wait until next May to do so.   I appreciate as much insight as any of you will offer me.  Thank you so much.  Many warm regards, sastird"
2165,"Hi!Another kinda hard question from me, I asked about a little romantic getaway I wanna make next month and I got hex 10 (treading) which by itself is good but then again it's changing to 33 (Retreat), the lines seem to be good (line 1 is about going with one's way and line 2 is about things going easy, line 3 talks about acting without much capacity (in my case it's economic capacity), but I'm prepared for that).My question is, since 10 is a ""good"" hex but 33 seems to be a ""bad"" one, what does it mean??, does it mean making the trip will be good but then bad or what? ('cause I'm extremely confused about this one)Thanx!"
2166,"Hey!I've been learning a lot about the I Ching this past few days, however the same question keeps ringing over and over again in my mind:How much does the person's emotional state affects the readings?That's because every time I've done readings while in a ""negative"" emotional state I get ""bad"" readings (meaning readings filled with warnings and bad omens), when I'm really happy and I do a reading I get only ""good"" hexagrams. So I guess one's emotional state affects the readings.Second, how much do you personally trust the automated online readings, 'cause to me they seem pretty inexact in the sense that there's no real input from the one doing the reading.Third, (the reading question), after realizing the emotional side of I Ching (what I wrote earlier), I meditated and focused myself in a question I asked 2 days ago (because when I originally asked it I was extremely emotional, that and I made an online reading), the question was ""Should I make the romantic trip that I want to make with XXXX in October?"", on the first (emotional) reading I got 10.1.2.3 > 33 (which is discussed in another thread), now I made the reading after meditating without emotional attachment and I got 19.4 > 54Now what exactly does line 19.4 mean, 'cause there seem to be a lot of interpretations and here in the forums everyone gets it the other way around (54.4 to 19)Sorry for the long post and thanx for all the answers!!Julian"

2168,"Please would someone help. If I have interpreted the readings correctly I will need to end my relationship.For the last 3 Wednesdays, my boyfriend goes to work very smartly and spends a long time in the mirror! He comes home very very late too - near midnight....I asked what was going on to him and he always says he has had to work late as x y and z happened.NB: He told me he had a problem with the broadband at home so couldnt work from home, tried to rectify it with the internet provided and had issue after issue- who said they delivered a router and he didnt get the card and now he was inconvenineced etc.. hence working from work as lots of powerful emails to send that could not be sent from his phone. He is also supposed to play football on wed eve's and he said he managed to do this too as a break inbetween work. As we were talking about the broadband he started to get anooyed so I didnt push the matter further, as i do have moments of insecurities which i am working on and I didnt want to be questioning unreasonably. THEREFOREI asked the Iching instead:What did A get up to last night: ans -44 no changing lines(a female who is bold and strong and not good to marry)Was A telling me the truth - 7.1.2.5.6>44The army; leading to increaseDid A have sex with this woman 54.5.6.>10The marrying maiden, a fruitless basket; garments unequal to the sister, tread carefullyIs R being Faithful to me 38 no changeOpposition - small matters - success, obsturction otherwiseIs R faithful to me 36.1>15Darkening of the light  MING; flying with drooping wings people illspeaking to modestyShould I end the relationship  52.1.5>37keeping still to the family -  keeps toes at rest, keep jaws at rest, do homely things (ie dont do anything!)The army reading is throwing me, i'm wondering if there is truth mixed in with lies and thats why it is so complex, but overall it seems that A met with a woman had sex and it was rubbish! If this is the case then it will all be over for me, but I would like a second opinion as I it could be my insecurities that are interpreting this wrongly, yet i need to keep still and do nothing?!Also in your view is there a better question I could have asked/should ask?I really appreciate all of your views, and will think carefully over what you interpretThank youxxLast edited: Sep 17, 2009"

2170,"For some time, my husband has been working on home improvement projects on our house. He's a do-it-yourselfer, while I think it's more economical to hire a professional. He's been prevailing in general, but I let him know in no uncertain terms that I'd like it to be different. Recently a new problem came up in the kitchen that will require some plumbing work. My husband wants to tackle it, but I want to hire a contractor. He doesn't want to spend money, which we are short on. On the other hand, I don't want to end up resenting him for  making our already tiny kitchen impossible to maneuver in for a long time while he figures out what he is doing. I'd be willing to give on this for the sake of marital harmony (which has been lacking in general), but I am truly worn down by the dissaray that has been part of our house for years. I asked ""What is right action regarding this conflict with my husband"" and received 57 unchanging.  I have absolutely no idea what this means. Thanks in advance for any insights."
2171,"Hello all.  Thank you for all of your help in the past. This is my first posting.  To make a long story medium, I have just recently fled a years-long abusive situation.  In the process I gave up all control of my finances and as a result I defaulted on everything including my student loans.  http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/images/smilies/duh.gifHaving lost everything I have decided to take this opportunity of total loss to start over completely, rebuilding my life through a trade I had always been seriously interested in but never pursued due to lack of time for the course work.  I can see from the threads that have helped me so much over the passed two years that many if not all of you understand the mistakes we can make by letting ourselves become attached to the idea that once we are on the corporate track, dreams that would take us off it must be subordinated to the time demands of sustaining our “job”.  Well, I have decided that the benefit of having been ‘23d right through my 47ing’ is that I get to completely recreate my life according to what I want to do for myself!  Yay!  I’ve lost EVERYTHING!  Now I get to lose the 100 pounds I gained in 10 months AND rebuild my life from scratch!  WHOOWEEE! Hang on, I’ve got a cartwheel in me and I’m NOT gonna let it die!  http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/images/smilies/biggrin.gifOk.  So, I have very little in practical terms, no cash whatsoever, am now on assistance since Sep 4th and am living in a room instead of a home and am looking for work.  BUT, I recently met a woman who told me about her recent completion of massage school, and how she attended a 6-month intensive program.  She got aid for tuition and living expenses and was done in 6 months.  When I looked into this nearly a decade ago programs were a minimum of 16 months.  I could not make the hours with my job at the time.  Now FT programs are at most 9-12 moths, and six month programs are certainly attractive to me.  All my life friends and family have encouraged me to get my license each time I performed my “family masseuse” function.  But I just could not get my mind around not being ""professional"" and it seemed irresponsible and a risk to my mortgage to leave behind successful corporate work (my definition of successful work has since changed completely, thank god) so I never took it on.  Well, years of corporate sabotage and all that junk has certainly opened my mind to trying a different way of making money and reevaluating the benefits my gifts can bring into my life.  Well, courses begin this month, next month in October at another school and also in January at a few other schools in my area.  Of course, though, in order to attend any program I will need financial aid.  However, as I mentioned, I have defaulted.  I have not yet contacted the loan granting agency (Federal William D. Ford loans) to see what they will allow, but I do know already that once in default a student is not eligible for aid, or for the benefit of forbearance, unless that student completes six months of steady payments.  Well, I of course consulted the Yî, as being on assistance with my $150 month - no children means that I can live on $150.00 per month - I do not know what payment plan that I can actually commit to paying they will agree to.  So I asked the Yî two questions:  Q: What will it take for me to be able to begin massage school? 6.2.4.5>23 = “Arguing Stripping Away”and Last Night I asked Q: Outcome of applying for Financial Aid to pay for massage school including living expenses? 1.1.5>50 = “Creative Force the Vessel”Any thoughts on these will be greatly appreciated.  Any insights into timing will also be helpful. I thank you all for everything you have helped me through so far.  My deepest thoughts for all your knots untied,  sastird"

2173,"Hi, I'm type II diabetic, and recently asked the I Ching to comment on the wisdom of following a vegetarian diet as part of a therapeutic approach to controlling weight and blood sugar.  I drew hexagram 38 Contradiction or Diverging according to R. L. Wing, similar with others.  Changing lines were 2nd and 4th, , both indicating I might meet a great or wise person who could advise me--yielding Hexagram 27 Nourishment or Corners of the Mouth.  I was encouraged that I drew a hexagram that spoke to nourishment, and also the ""contradiction"" of Hex 38 seemed to reflect the contradictory dietary advice that diabetics are given, ranging from the high protein low-carb approach of Atkins et al, to low-fat vegan, etc.  I tend to lean more towards the veg. end of things (high fiber, etc.) such as macro and others, but I didn't feel that the reading was clear-cut (so what else is new   ).

About him, i asked about his feelings getting as answer the 60,1,3>48.and this, if i get it well is true: he's putting limits between us, because i 'm getting total crazy and he's going mad too  .But i didn't get what it means the 48    i have asked what should i do respect him? the answer was the 34, no changes.

2179,"Hi there I threw a reading some time ago regarding a life long hobby of mine. Its a hobby that involves other people and weekly meet-ups. My current plan is to stick with the hobby until the end of the year. But I threw this some time ago before that and don't think I fully understood what it meant. Any advice or help in interpretation would be appreciated.I asked:Should I give up X? Response:Hexagram 48.1.2.3 -> 3I realize this is not a great question to ask as it's a ""yes or no"" question with a definitive implied answer. As I realize the answer is complex I don't expect a definitive yes or no interpretation on this. Usually the Yijing doesn't serve well to yes or no questions in the asking or interpreting for. If anything what this hexagram verifies for me is that in the past my hobby has been stagnating - i've been allowing myself to be held back and not giving it all my go (line 3) I've been allowing inferior influences to overtake me in association with it. (line 2) And perhaps the hobby is a little in need of renovation at some level (line 1) Line 3 - seems to contradict any interpretation for line 1 being a decisive advice to give up the hobby. Line 2 seems to reinforce the need for a more sincere attitude towards the hobby. Hexagram 3 seems to advice not taking any action - to get myself out of a confused state and to seek helpers (hobby involves instruction) - that i'm still at the starting level - (which i feel whole heartedly even though i've done it so long) seems to advice taking part in what is going on instead of retreating. Overall the response is a stern and strong message to get my act together - and stop horsing around and wasting time. I think it's encouraging me to deepen my work with it.Stop being shy and really go for it with all i've got.I'd appreciate any comments or advice... :bows:"
2180,"Hi,I met a new guy this week. I approached him and told me to contact me if he ever wanted to have a coffee with me. He did today, asking me if I wanted to have diner or something. We talked for maybe an hour about all and nothing. We didn't set a date yet, but we started talking about it at the end. Then, he said he had to go because he was late. He asked me for my phone number and said he would call later. I don't know if he will, but I had a strange feeling about him. So, I asked the I-Ching:1. Tell me more about him. 27.3 > 222. Will he call me? 16.5 > 451. It seems not really good, but I'm not sure.2. I thought it was good, but line 5 gets me confused and makes me think I'm wrong."

2183,I had recent breakup with my fiance and I asked the question (how can i get over my ex and move on with my life)  the answer was 63 L2 & L6 changing to 9.  What does this mean.
2184,"I have a lunch today with my ex so I asked (what will be the outcome of this meeting today with my ex)  53 L1, L3 & L6 changing to 3.  Help.  Help.  What should i make of this."
2185,"Hi everyone,I'm new to posting on here, although have been reading the forums on this site for some time now.I recently saw a post which suggested phrasing a question 'Please provide me with my principal of right action today'. I asked this today and now need help please with the response which was 51 line 6 changing to 21.To put it in context, I've suspected my partner of four years is having an affair, I know that he stays up all night talking to a woman on the internet.  He tells me that it's 'just a friendship' although he's been so indifferent to me, I suspected it was more.  Today, I stupidly looked at the hundreds of mesages they've been sending each other, and it is definitely an affair (I won't go into the sordid details).I am incredibly shocked and upset, - hence I suppose hexagram 51, although because I asked the question regarding principal of right action for myself, does this mean that I should confront (shake) the situation or remove myself from it? 21 seems to imply that I should take some sort of action in the form of punishment, (although I'm not a vindictive sort of person!) Please can anyone help? Thank you"
2186,Hi allI was in a relationship sometime ago where i am now very glad I am out of and we have both moved on.I recently saw some pictures of her through facebook and the pics seem to reveal to me anyway that she did not look to happy sought of inside its like if you have been close to someone you can look at them alot more than diferent than the way others might see that person.From what i saw she looked lost sought of well i thought maybeI asked the oracle did she miss me I mean we have both moved on I have none of the same feelings I had at the time for her because i was in love with an Ideal her not who she really was and she would have known thatwhen I read the lines from the question does she miss me and recieved 56.3.4.6>2she is really is a wanderer i think she always will be also the lines seemed to reflect a person or is unstable as she is i mean since we have broken up lord knows how times she as moved and how many partners she has had I mean I wonder how that could make anyone happy just the never knowing where your next meal is going to come from feelingI guess I would like out side opinions on what the lines reveal of what kind of person we are dealing withthank in advancegod bless

2190,"Hi everyone,I've been studying the I Ching for a while now and have noticed a few interesting things. When I first started I think (as a lot of people do) I got a bit obsessive and was asking questions about every area of my life that I felt anxiety about, trying to second guess things over which I had little control, and generally driving myself crazy. However after a while I realised that my study was making me calmer, and much more accepting of change, and life moving in cycles. Its made it easier to accept difficult situations with faith that ultimately everything changes, and also to be a bit more aware and in the moment when things go well. Generally I'm finding myself more chilled out, and much more intuitive than before. Now when I ask a question of the I Ching I think very carefully about whether I really need to know the answer and whether I'm being respectful of myself and the process. As a result my readings are much clearer and more useful as a means of guidance. I also decided to stick with the yarrow stalks and the full length traditional technique because I find its useful in getting me into a calm meditative state and clearing my mind (and stops me asking stupid questions for the hell of it!)So two questions, first I'd welcome anyone else's thoughts on the above and how you find you engage with the I Ching, and what you learn from it or understand about yourself...and second, while on this train of thought I asked the question:What am I supposed to be learning from the I Ching? 14:1 to 50So, I have my own interpretation (around modesty/humbleness, respecting the fact that things happen in their own time, and that I am learning a new way of being in the world), but I would love to hear your thoughts on the reading.Thanks!!E"

On the other hand ""haste"" hardly typifies anything about it.I still don't know what to do with all moving lines, but past experience would suggest it does mean *something* is going to happen finally."

2198,"Hello all,Just to say I am doing well. Things aren't throwing me into despair and I've been better for at least a week! So feeling like I've reached a level of understanding and acceptance. I don't think that means things can't/won't deeply affect me again, but I feel slightly more untouchable at the mo  which is good because being depressed makes it very hard to do things. Thanks everyone for your help.There has been a matter of the heart playing heavily on my mind also for a while.I am resolving it - in the sense that I feel my happiness would not rest on it - but that doesn't take away the feeling.I asked today, Am I seeing this through a veil of illusion?61.1, 6 > 29Whaddya think? I have my own ideas about it. One being I think perhaps the Yi could be saying - stop asking about this issue! (61.6)  and also how you shouldn't be overly reliant on others, despite a connection? (61.1). But I just feel a bit torn. Lise says of 61.6: 'Give your emotions a fair chance to live life without giving it names.' and coupled with hex 29 - does it say you have to go where the heart leads to learn your lesson, despite the fear and pain? and the doubt that I am alluding to?Any instant reactions would be most welcome. I worry how far feelings can cause self-deception and distortion of the truth.Thanks:bows:Last edited: Sep 5, 2009"

My ""love-life"" or lack thereof sure could use a spark of some sort, but is this a positive or neg?  What's this repeated shock business anyway?  Would that indicate the past repeating itself  or more maybe my mistakes repeating, as in not learning the lessons I prob should be learning in regard to this matter2.  Asked IC for insight/advice on my life in general right now.  Received 19.2.6 -->27.

2210,"My wife has been offered the position of a head of a kindergarten.

As a result  she feels a bit uneasy with trespect to the position offered now.The place itself looks good - nice building, excellent equipment etc. The former head left - obviously there must have been some kind of arguments between her and the colleagues...When asking my wife got this one: 32, lines 2,4 and 5 - thus turning into 39 - Obstacle.I told her that it would take quite a lot of patience, that the job would certainly not be an easy one, however, she should accept. She would have to get into an effective routine.She would also have to accept that fact that she would probably come across some unpleasant situations. Behind 32 there's 38, Opposition - (World of thought arrangement shining through King Wen's World of senses arrangement).I should also add that her present job might end within one or two years, at least there's some uncertainty about it - in any case it is not a secure one.Am I right telling her to accept - in spite of the problems mentioned?Regards,Martinus"
2211,"I need some help here...a situation where I am just stumped. My middle child ""T"", age 13 (almost 14), will not come to my house. she stays with her father. We have not had a fight, there has been nothing strained between us that I know. Background is that she, as a younger child, has had many medical issues due to being premature. I have always been the one to take her to appts., stay with her in the hospital, the one that would run to school to pick her up if there was a problem, etc...you get the idea. Her father and I divorced 5 years ago. She doesn't seem interested in seeing her younger (baby) sister, whom I know she adores, or hanging out with her older sister, whom, incidentally, came to live with me exclusively shortly after her father and I separated because of the constant fighting. Is this paybacks? She was pretty upset when her older sister would not see her dad...it seemed to have hurt her too.I asked, ""what do I need to know about T? 54.4>19What do I need to do about T? 2.4>16This just started this past spring, and I have been trying to let her do what she wants. Although she appears to be a normal child, I see that her issues and surgeries (largely neurological) might have affected her thought process, which makes me feel that I need to keep an even closer eye on her (I'm the medical person whereas her father is, and admits to being, terrified of her condition, even to this day.) I've talked to him, he sort of threw the older daughter thing in my face, but denied that T had discussed anything with him (he's also not very approachable as far as having crucial conversations - part of our problem). T is also very poor at verbalizing her thoughts/needs/feelings. It's always been a guessing game.Any insights? I think I'm being told to jus sit back and wait, it will all work out without anything, but need an objective view. It's really breaking my heart!Thanks again!"
2212,"(sorry for my bad English)My wife's sister (25) messed with wrong man (about 18 years older) and got pregnant.

At this moment they are separated, do not communicate and all she is thinking of now is how to 'undo' what has been done. However she waited too long and is now in 4th+ month meaning it's far for trivial operation and to make things even worse the law in our country states that after 3+ months nothing can be done before special committee  allows the abortion. She is not even sure (conscience etc) if she wants to abort or get birth and raise child without father.

I'm only now starting to see the ""resulting"" hexagram less in terms of a future result (although in some cases it can point to straightforward outcomes) and more in terms of the root or unconscious of the situation, depending on the question. I'm curious to know how others approach resulting hexagrams in cases where they tend to point more to actions or attitudes rather than outcomes."
2215,"Hi - I've got a serious upstairs neighbor problem, and I just moved to this new place. I will often be sound asleep and at 1:15am the banging starts, wakes me up from slumber (often dreams too), and continues until 5am. This is with my earplugs in and a pillow over my head.  I do not know if there are drugs or alcohol involved upstairs, and I live alone beneath them. From the sounds of it, the upstairs people move furniture (nightly) btwn the hours of 1 and 5am, slam cabinets and windows, wear high heels (the female) on hardwood floors, or large heavy shoes (the man). The noise occurs daytime too, (I work from home), but I realize they have a right to make noise in working hours so I have let that go. However, to be roused from my sleep night after night is not acceptable. The tenants there are new. I have left two notes. The second one said if they did not quiet down ""we"" would call the police. (We = the imaginary family of five I wanted to think they were disturbing). It was quiet for two nights after that last note and then began again. I have tried visualization techniques, nothing works. My landlady is aware of the problem, but really isn't doing anything to help me. Part of the problem is their shoes, the other part is the kind of people I imagine them to be. They often play loud music during the daytime on weekdays, so I have decided whoever is there is 1) not employed and 2) rather young. There aren't more than 2 people up there, although the height of the noise sounded like at least 5. I went 10 days with literally no sleep, my nerves were so on edge. I asked the Yi ""what forces can i use to quiet the upstairs neighbors"". (I'm willing to go the voodoo route at this point if i have to!) The Yi said Hex 9.2. -> hex 26.I reviewed an old thread on 9.2. I gather it talks about ""refining the outward appearance so as to make a good impression on some one else "" or ""get one's house in order just for the sake of the self."" But neither really relates to this issue.For reference: Hex 9: The Taming Power of the SmallHas success.Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.The ImageThe wind drives across heaven:The image of The Taming Power of the Small.Thus the superior manRefines the outward aspect of his nature.L2: He allows himself to be drawn into returning.Good fortune.Returning? Another note? Introducing myself? (??) Alone or with a group of people who ""live with me""?I am afraid to go upstairs ALONE bc if the noisemakers realize I live alone beneath them they wont be very inclined to shut up. I thought of getting my friend and her husband to show up with me. I have a pair of slippers and was tempted to bring those up with chocolates... I just dont know what will be effective.Part of the problem also is I'm afraid to call the police bc between the time I phone and the time they arrive, the tenants COULD quiet down, and then it would be a case of ""he said/she said"". It's common for them to bang for ten minutes and be quiet for half an hour -- you almost fall back asleep -- and then bang again for another 10. But solid quiet for more than 2 hrs is rare.Can someone help me interpret this hex?Thanks in advance, E.Last edited: Jun 22, 2007"

Its not the first time someone I know and had a close relationship is dying but this time is a bit different. Here, in my country, doctors and relatives try to hide from the patient the truth.

I had to respect their decision but till today I’m not sure if I did the right thing. Now, my friend, according to doctor will die soon. I talk to him , I try to be myself but this whole situation is terra incognita to me and  “being myself” is not that clear what really is.

2217,"I bought a pair of shoes on Ebay. It was a spurra the moment kinda thang. Which basically means I won them with one low bid before I even had a chance to decide if I really wanted them.

2219,"Hex 18.1.2.5 > 37 & Hex 56.1.2 > 14 in relation to chasing up a creative opportunityHello again senior members and fellow seekers i was hoping to get some help interpreting these responses from the IC about following up on a request for a creative (job) opportunity in a very competitive industry....Basic past history is that I did a workshop with this very respected TV director and he invited everyone to email him with CVs etc, His main motto was to be tenacious and keep breaking boundaries and stereotypes etc. And he kept emphasising how important it was to just ""go for it"" and email head people direct. So after the workshop I emailed him expressing my passion and desire to get back into this kind of work etc. and also added a light joke about my shortcomings at the workshop (which was part of the feedback he handed out) i.e. mainly that I was working on it.That was about a month ago.Soon after I posted a question on this site about whether he'd respond etc and got a positive response from Willowfox i.e. to expect that he would respond. Here's the link...http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?p=94629#post94629I've now asked the IC....""Is P still considering responding to my email?""I got Hex 46.3.4 > 40""Do I need to email him again and be more proactive and pushy?""I got Hex 18.1.2.5 > 37This confused me as it never came up before with relation to this situation and I'm wondering what damage I may have caused or what was spoilt??""Should I email him again if I want a response from him?""I got 56.1.2 > 14I checked out a similar posting with this response and there was talk about not demeaning oneself and making jokes at one's expense (56.1) and that through modesty and reservedness one finds the liking of other people and a particularly helpful person or opportunity (56.2) which I assume leads to the big having on Hex 14....These last two hexes for a similar question therefore confused me Any help interpreting is much appreciated :bows:thanks as alwaysSofia"
2220,Me and 2 other people were up for contract renewals around the same time. Our boss came to us and gave us paltry 3 month renewal and no pay raises.

The one project this one other person was the lead on brought the company a 20% increase in profits in the first few months of implementation! It is plastered all over the tv and billboards and so on and my project is expected to do  the same if not betterAnother kicker is the boss hired some new contractor just a few weeks earlier with a 6 month contractSo I asked the yi what was up with our boss giving us the paltry extension and no pay raises?Answer43.1.2 to 31I get from that he doesn't really like us.I asked about what I can do for my career and got48.2.3.6 to 20I get that I should increase my knowledge and it will be a gradual process and then go out and share that knowledge with others.How can I be the bosses pet?15 unchangingBe modest!

I guess that's normal after you've been with someone for so long. Anyway, I felt good being around her and realized I had missed her company. She showed a lot of emotion at seeing me and took me in her arms when we went our separate ways for a hug.  However, as soon as we parted, I choked up, and haven't been able to stop weeping since I got back from our meeting. On to my question: I want very much to try to open my heart to her again on the basis of friendship, and rebuild a completely different relationship with her, without any intention to try to steer it back to being together as a couple. However, I worry that I'm lying to myself, because I still love her deeply, and I don't know if attempting to let her back into my life to an extent would be in bad faith (eg deep down I yearn to get us back together). Our relationship wasn't working on so many levels, we wanted different things, so if I try to rebuild something with her, it would have to be with zero expectation of any outcome. She has said in the past that she wants to be in regular contact, and I've resisted that, because I felt I needed time and space to grieve and heal. I asked the Yi whether I should open up and let her back into my life to an extent, or at least be open to that, or whether it would be more self-honest to maintain strict boundaries. I got 18.1- 26. It does seem to imply restraint (26), but also working toward repairing something. Then I asked whether I have the requisite strength and courage to try to start afresh with her on a radically different basis. I got 49, Revolution, lines changes at 2 and 4, which transforms to 5 (Waiting). ANother puzzling one-- suggests movement, action, having courage to make sweeping change, but changes to 5. Does anyone have any ideas? I really appreciate your help. This has been such a testing time, but she and I have something special even if our ""coupledom"" is over for good, and I can't see myself just never interacting with her again. However, am I overestimating my strength?"
2222,"I am not very clear about the answers I got, so I would like to get some input, I would really appreciate it! My story is: I was approached by an artist to participate in a project he is working on. I don't know him, but he has been in this business for a long time, and I am new in this field so I am considering to work with him. My instinct about this person was telling me not to trust this person completely, but I have been wrong many times lately, I don't know anymore when to trust my instinct. So I decided to ask the I ching. What should I do in this situation? Should I accept?I got 58 1.5.6. to 64 Now the first changing line sounds positive but the 5. line talkes about danger, somebody can bring me harm, I should resist, and the 6. line is also very negative, I have entered a path that has unfortunate consequences. What kind of danger is the Yi referring to? Isth Yi advising me not to work with this person?  I also asked  What will the outcome be if I work with him?I got 27 2.5. to 61It doesn't really say anything about the outcome, more like what I should do, how to be independent and care for myself and not expecting others to do it for me. Am I seeing this right? If anyone has anything to add, please do so! I would love to hear them! Thank you so much!Manci"
2223,"Hi again!I found this forum extremely helpful and I'd like to ask for your insights once again.I'm currently single, so I asked the questionWho can I meet my future husband?got6.3.5.6 -> 32I find line 6 especially troubling Any ideas on how to interpret the whole thing?"
2224,"Since I asked a new question with new hexagrams, I began a newer thread. This relates to a relationship and to having an upcoming talk with an ex.I asked ""If I speak of changes I've made and I want to make w/ C what can I expect?"" and got 1.1.5 > 50which seems to be favorable--but I'd love to get some additional insights. This is the same answer I got when I asked last week if there was a possible romantic (re)union in our future.(BTW, I'm new at this--I didn't tie the question to the upcoming trip to see C per se; does the Yi make its advice relevant to exactly what I've asked, or to what's in the air around the question?)I also asked ""what can I do now to restore our union?"" and got 31.4.5 > 15which seems to be about integrity, modesty, humility and making one's influence felt from a higher place, no? Also, It's the IC answer I got that felt most like my desire to talk of changes I've made.(It's strange, though, the IC yesterday advising it is best not to send a note about the trip right now...?)Ideas and comments about these are most welcome-- Willowfox, I'd love to hear from you Thank you and many, many blessings."
2225,"Hi all,I would appreciate any insight about my reading.  I asked whether I would get back/be with a certain person.  I got 9, Hsiao Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Small.  What does this mean??

2227,"Hi everybody! This is my first posting and inquiry. I need help in interpreting my answer.I am in school and in only the second meeting of this particular class I felt dismissed by the professor. It was our first in-class essay, and yes, I screwed it up, though was doing my best at the time within the parameters. Class ended abruptly at 8PM when it was agreed upon by the entire class that class would not break until 9 or 9:15 at the earliest the week before. It is supposed to be a 4 hour class. We all decided that we would not take breaks. Instead of going from 6-10PM we would finish at 9 or 9:15. The syllabus for this class is 9 pages long, the assignments are many and intense and where I was once willing and ready to rise to the occasion, I am now wondering if I should bother at all at this time. It isa required class for the long-term, yet not one I have to do now. I feel I may be at a disadvantage and do not want to set myself up for a fall. I have 2 other classes that also require a lot of homework. The thing is I feel like this teacher does not really want to teach, it's like here's the syllabus, here's what's expected of you do it or else, there is no compassion or encouragement re: the teaching process. I am in school to learn. If I wanted to be totally on my own I would take an on-line internet course. I asked the I ching:`Would it be beneficial for me to drop this English class?' I received 57.5.6 changing into 46. My take is that I should move on for now and let it go, but I am not sure if there is something within this reading that I am missing. More clarity would be greatly appreciated. Any of you wise souls that can help me elucidate my situation? Please help. Thank you, Anya:"
2228,"I'm wondering if i am on the right track with my interpretation about these answers to the following questions:question 1: Will I be successful in getting my colorist to do my hair?answer: 1.1.2.4.5 to 52The back story is that my colorist moved away from my city a couple of years back. Since then I have traveled to see her and have her lighten my hair because I love how she does it. She's got a lot of stuff going on in her life though and I don't know what's going on with her currently. Is the Yi telling me that I should ""be still"" because my colorist may not be available to me anymore? Perhaps I'll find someone else soon to do it for me? Can anyone help me break down what the lines are conveying to me here?I also asked about going to a salon that I visited one time last year instead. They did a great job, though they had a different method from my old colorist. I asked:question 2: Should I get it done by the salon instead of having my old colorist do it?answer: 24.4 to 51I feel like this is saying not to return to this salon but that I have ""a good friend"" somewhere that can help me. If this ""friend"" is not my old colorist, is this a new colorist that I haven't met yet?Thanks for any light you can shed on my questions!"
2229,"Hello I need some help with this reading, the question is ""How I should proceed with this person?""Background:  I met this man at a drum circle and he gave me his number.  The first week was great.  Then he told be that his schedule was very busy and it will be hard to keep in touch.  So we'd talk when he was available.  Now we don't talk at all. We had made plan to meet up and he never called or showed up.  Normally I would just let it go but our conversations were deep and on my level so I did a reading on how I should proceed with him to see if it was all games coming from him and I received 37 (the family) stress 2 and 9.  Please help if you have any idea's"

Can you tell me what you think, please??? Thanks a lot."
2234,"Hello,I asked:Why didn't he answer me? 14,3,4 > 41Is he going to answer me next week? 58,2 > 17Here are my questions:1. Is hexagram 41 necessarily negative? How should I interpret it?2. Is line 2 in hexagram 58 negative as well? I found various interpretations which left me confused.58, line 2(Richard Wilhelm): ""We often find ourselves associating with inferior people in whose company we are tempted by pleasures that are inappropriate for the superior man. To participate in such pleasures would certainly bring remorse, for a superior man can find no real satisfaction in low pleasures. When, recognizing this, a man does not permit his will to swerve, so that he does not find such ways agreeable, not even dubious companions will venture to proffer any base pleasures, because he would not enjoy them. Thus every cause for regret is removed.""58, line 2 (Robert G. Benson): ""He is sought out by his leader to share himself, and he loyally agrees. After doing this, his doubts and regrets will pass, and he will benefits. Although he could refuse to share, he has ties of loyalty that bind him to his leader. His leader now asks for his commitment and cooperation, so he places his trust in his leader and agrees to share. Later, he finds that following his leader's request does bring to him, and his doubts and regrets fade. He may be asked to do something he wouldn't otherwise do, but he agrees anyway, hoping for the best.""Thanks,Lyrandra"
2235,"This is follow on to my previous post yesterday. I just came to terms with what my real problem is; no matter how much I ""think"" I admire my values, I don't like or value myself.. As in, any time someone in authority finds something wrong with me, it means that there is something wrong with me. Ugh! I thought I had licked this through years of therapy and self help study, but not so. In this context, I typed out a simple ""Help for what ails me?"" and received 50.1.3 changing to 38. Given that I have done a lot of work around this, the ""been there, done that"" sort of ennui makes it hard to see a fresh approach, but perhaps it's as simple as reminding myself that it's ""me"" not ""them"" when I feel insecure. Any other insights would be appreciated!"
2236,"Hi, I'm new here, and new to i ching  I just did a reading about a relationship, asking why the person I'm involved with is in my life (ie what do we have to teach each other).

2237,"Hello all!Long time since I wrote here.I hope you can help me interpreting this answer. I asked ""what can I do to spend more time with this person? As time and busyness seems to be a constraint...Thanks for your help!Libe"
2238,(yes again an asking for insight for it is a bit of a stagnated time for me... It's wonderfull this IC forum existst!)For me it is not unthinkable that again early november 2009 it might come to another crash in the monetaire system. This could mean the start of the end of value of money.This ofcourse in not a fact it's just a personal vision formed by what I understand is going on in astrologic events that will happen by then.What outcome gives the IC  if I would put my savings in a piece of land instead.20.3.4.6 > 31
2239,"Thanks for all your posts.I often wonder if my interpretations are colored by my delusions, for lack of a better word, so I decided to post.Long story short, I'm a middle-aged man, finally found my soul mate 10 years ago, partnership ended 2 years ago, and I'm now stuck at this point expecting, believing, and wishing this person is going to contact me.Question: What can I expect of waiting for contact?Hex 1 (lines 1, 4, 5) changing to Hex 18""I can expect more waiting. I can also expect to make a choice between more waiting or facing the fact that things follow their own course and progress without my influence and the only proper advice is to work on my own negativity.This person is not going to contact you. Be patient, be true to yourself, and you will eventually work through this.""As I dread to hear there will be no contact, although just below the surface I think that's what I feel is true, I tried to put a friendlier spin on it:""What if this person does contact you? Have you worked out all your issues? Get yourself together so if there is contact, it will be a success. Get yourself together so if there's NO contact, it will be a success.""Thanks for listening.Briancalledbrad"
2240,"I asked the I Ching why it is that so many of the members of my immediate family - especially on my mum's side - aunts, grandmother, parents, my cousins - have all suffered/ suffer with various forms and intensities of depression and/or anxiety disorders. Dysfunctional families has been a running theme throughout - beginning with the divorce of my grandmothers parents when it was still rare to do so! And subsequent damage to her passed on.. and though she was a strong woman, she could not be such a close or involved mother to my mother and aunts (who were sent to boarding school at 4 years old) because she hadn't received proper care herself from either of her parents. And these limitations are passed on.. though I do think it is possible to make a conscious effort also to change the patterns - but then perhaps it does also come down to luck - finding the right partner! Though that can be even harder if you're not so stable yourself... and I think you can also inherit self-destructive tastes in men!Anyway I received 24.2,5 > 60I have begun to think of hex 24 as about learning. After something bad happening you return to a new cycle where you can start again on a better footing ie. slightly more armed this time, after learning during a difficult time.Could this be saying that we are not examining and learning from our mistakes or negative tendencies etc? Not accepting self and/or the past and so not moving on? Or could it be about returning to the same old issues? I'm not sure about this reading at all so any takers would be great.ThanksLast edited: Aug 26, 2009"
2241,"What does A want from me?41-->26   changing line (3)What am I looking for in her?61--59 changing line 1Generally the I-ching has been giving me alot of mixed messages in my POV, basically say its not time, slow down etc. however..reality is I'm not doing much- though I know she's very reserved and I know she likes me.I'd like to see where it goes-her being a friend, but I keep getting negative warnings. And reality is..once I kinda dismissed though I know I shouldn't have- but its been a couple times, so I'm questioning if she's really worth going for.

2242,I'am in the need for someone to help me with a renovating job.I know a nice honest carpenter that I already spoke to a few months ago. He couldn't tell me by then if he would have time to help me out.What does the IC say about the possibility that this guy can come and help me soon.Answer 9.5 . 26Thanks guys and girlz
2243,"First, thanks to all who have responded to posts down through the years so that newbies like me can have the benefit of different perspectives on the hexagrams and their changing lines. What a fabulous repository of insight/reflection.Next my question, and thanks in advance for any and all feedback/insight offered.I'm feeling a bit disgusted with my work environment, wondering if my idealism and sense of mission is misplaced, or that maybe I'm badly miscast in my current role. No one else (most especially management) seems to think that what I focus on is a priority, and I'm viewed as a bit of a zealot about things that don't matter (fixing problems that have been ignored for years) and dinged for the things that seem to matter most to my supervisor (plenty of paperwork and artificial deadlines). Lately I've been feeling dispirited and burned out. In response to my question ""What is right focus for personal growth at work"". I drew 15>7. After reading lines 2 and 3 of 15, the message seems to be that I""m not to be afforded the luxury of throwing in the towel on this struggle, right? Any further thoughts/clarification regarding how to maximize my learning curve in this situation would be GREATLY appreciated."
2244,I found a girl that I really like and we have meet several times as friends. But now she does not want to see me anymore. So I asked I Ching if it was something wrong I have done. The answer was 42.2.5. Please help me find a clear interpretation.
2245,"After a decade of living like a gypsy and travelling the world, I settled down with a husband, children and mortgage (in reverse order) After almost another decade of this oh-so stationary life, I'm feeling so restless, as if I've settled for something professionally and personally that is far less ""alive"" than anything I dreamed I'd settle for. For some time, I've been dreaming of taking my family on the road, but it feels like a need a level of means to make this happen than my currently cash strapped reality (and conservative husband) will allow. I really want to provide my children with a much more uniquely tailored education than my full time work  will allow. Leaving my current job feels impractical and yet Ietting go of my inner vision feels like a sellout. In response to my question ""what is guidance regarding having the freedom to teach my children through travel"" I drew hex 23.1.2.4.5>10. I really have no clue what this could mean.

BTW, these questions come from a prior thread which I got help about (thanks, Willowfox!) and am posting anew since it involves a new set of questions about upcoming course of action.I wanted to prepare some (the trip feels very amorphous to me and I was looking for more clarity) before going, so I asked ""what will help me feel closer to C and increase my confidence and faith now?"" and got 45.2.4 changing to 29.

2248,My first question was asking about the significance of a romantic dream I had about someone and the answer was Hexagram 45 - Gathering Together.  I didn't really understand how that related to the dream so I let it go and asked a totally different question about how my job will be in the next few months.  I got the exact same Hexagram again.  That has not happened to me before and I wondered what it means?  does the Hexagram go with the original question more or the 2nd question or is it trying to tell me something else?
2249,"Recently experienced a setback in my career (one that requires years of training and preparation), and someone I respect told me they thought I am not suited for the career.  I started thinking that perhaps they are right, but it would be a huge change, and I don't know how to proceed.  I asked the I Ching: ""Should I continue in my current career?"" And received 29 (The Abysmal), lines 2 and 3 changing, moving to 39 (Obstruction).  Then I asked: ""What kind of career should I pursue?""  And again received 29.2.3 -> 39 !I interpret this to mean that I should continue (""if you are sincere, you have success in your heart and whatever you do succeeds""), just like water flows uninterruptedly, but for now, there is nothing great that can be attained, so I must content myself with smaller steps...Thanks for your thoughts!"
2250,"Question today: What level of interest is my resume generating at the employment agency?I've never received this line combination before, so would anyone like to share their experiences with it?

2251,"Bit of a saga, I'd welcome your thoughts!A couple of months ago i met a man who i had an incredibly strong connection with (he felt the same way) but after a very intense couple of months he backed off very suddenly saying he wasn't emotionally ready to get involved. I was aware of his very complicated and difficult emotional history (divorce, kids who live with him etc) so it made sense but was obviously very upsetting and felt like a 'right person, totally wrong time' situation. To check it out at the time I asked:What is happening right now? 28 (moving line 6) to 44 (which was pretty clear)What will happen if I do nothing now? 13 (moving lines 3, 6) to 17 so I backed off, and left him alone. I wanted to find out if I should keep and open mind about the relationship working at a later date so asked:what will happen with the relationship? 39:3,4 to 45 which I took to mean things would be difficult and there was nothing I could do to proceed right now, although its not hopeless.then...will I have to resolve this situation or will he? 52:3, to 23Will he come back? 46:3,4 to 40What will happen with him and me? 53:3,4,5,6 to 16How will meeting again be accomplished? 55:1,3,4,5 to 8Is he the right person for me? 53 (no moving lines)Should I just let go and move on? 64:4,6 to 7then I realised I needed to look to myself rather than asking questions about what he is likely to do...What is the most important thing I need to understand about this situation? 3:1 to 8 (once again, pretty clear)Where is he in relation to me? 15:3,6 to 23what is my position in relation to him (am I proceeding correctly)? 10:2 to 25What do I need to understand about my actions/feelings towards him? 20:4,6 to 45and finally (phew) what do I need to learn from being alone? 51:1,5 to 45if anyone has the energy to go through all of these I'd be really interested in your thoughts. My feeling is its not the right time but I should keep an open mind about what will happen in the future, and the opportunity will arise to do something at the right time...the really good thing in all of this is that its really taught me a lot about the i ching and using my intuition to work through the different interpretations (I use Blofeld and Alfred Huang which is a great combination of perspectives).Thanks in advance!!"

2253,"Wow, this is terrifying  like being on stage or something.I used the iching for the first time this week because I am in a peculiar situation and conventional methods (like picking up the phone!) are temporarly out.My lady interest and I have not spoken in many months, and things were left in a strange place, with lots of unanswered questions. I owe her a in-person conversation, but she lives far away so who knows how long it will be before we can sit down. She is a strong woman, successful, well-rounded and popular, I think. She might have strong feelings for me, that's up in the air, but even if she does, I can't imagine her letting anyone know she's unhappy! I want to know if she's been effected by our lack of relations (on account I sure have!) so I asked just that and got 22.3.5.6>3.Is this about finding out I'm a good, simple guy? Or is it about her thinking I am not what she's looking for? There have been misunderstandings, and now I feel I might know her better than she knows me, but my intensions were always good and true, I think I could love her.If anyone has any ideas, that'd be great!

While guy A was not at the party, some people who know him were and may have seen, I'm not sure though. I am panicking as this would definately end all progress with guy A whom I actually really want to be with. My question was, ""Does guy A know (has someone told him) about me kissing guy B?""response: 12.1.3.5 changing to hex 30now I have no idea what line 1 is telling me about the situation but I imagine that line 3 is about me feeling ashamed about what I did. Line 5 I feel could either also be about me, showing how anxious I am about not knowing if he knows. Or maybe it is him being anxious about me now that he does know and doesn't know what to do now?I am also unsure how hex 30 fits in the picture, is it just there to show that I am still clinging to guy A?Does anyone have any ideas about whether this is an affirmative answer to my question?Thanks!"

I have yet to know why, so I asked: Why did S make things so bad for me at the workplace? 32.1>34. alot of demands placed?thanks if you can help."
2258,"Hi,I have had a couple of readings involving hex 8 and 52 which I'd like help exploring. I have just come back from a weekend holiday - climbing a mountain was involved! I went with family - a couple of whom I don't know that well. I found it difficult as my usual social anxiety reared its ugly head. And as I've been feeling down and isolated recently I'm finding it harder to have fun and talk to people when I have the opportunity.. out of the habit along with my same old issues... Anyway I was quite quiet and it has caused a further sense of disappointment in myself - though I know I put too much pressure on myself and need to accept my shyness as others perhaps do - but I am not comfortable with being this person. I want to be able to express myself as I know I could... I just think I'm better off alone at the moment, especially as I'm plagued with even more awful thoughts when I'm with people.Before going I asked 1. How can I be best prepared for this weekend?5.2 > 63 Remaining calm during disagreements came true as two of them were bickering a lot!2. How can I make the best of it?52.3,5,6 > 8This answer seemed perfect as we were going to climb a mountain (hex 52 mountain on mountain!) Which of course was exhausting and required holding together and sharing the experience - and encouraging each other to keep going! (though it was just the two of us that made it in the end. I've always thought of hex 8 as two people!)But hex 52 also seems to encourage silence (which seems to oppose achieving union?)- so I took it as saying I may feel awkward with them (as I anticipated) because of my negative frame of mind etc, and not knowing them too well, but that it's best not to try too hard. Be silent and calm... but hold together with them..But I felt bad for perhaps not contributing that much (for want of something to talk about) and thus for not being able to relax enough to enjoy the experience...My inability to be natural and have fun this weekend has been another mental setback and I feel hopeless about myself - especially in regards to being able to join in and feel a part of things.. So I asked Do I need to go on anti-depressants?8.3,5,6 > 52Such a weird thing the same combination again but a different order!Perhaps it's reminding me that my problem is related to poor communication with other people, and that perhaps taking anti-depressants would help the problem by reducing my negative thoughts thus making me more open and cheerful?Although 8.3 could be saying it's a bad idea? Or that I'm lacking friends around me at the mo (ones I have things in common with etc which is true) which is why union is proving extra difficult? 8.5 I'm not sure about in relation to anti-depressants - save it's about not needing to flatter and allowing for everyone (including yourself perhaps) to be an individual.Then 8.6... could be saying that it's not possible to solve my probs this way?Or that now is the time to try to resolve union within myself - and that anti-depressants might realign me?Maybe I just need to weather my mental storms as a mountain does?? Or that I am the mountain which isn't holding it together and this needs to be resolved?I'm not productive when I lack faith in myself so I don't know what else to do right now but take them, until I can leave home again and find a niche.. or new experiences and meet new people... but as my confidence is low that is becoming ever more daunting.The 5HTP has been working - but I'm still being thrown overboard by minor setbacks, though it has helped me sleep and calm in other situations where I was struggling! And it did seem to kick start a new sense of optimism.. but this weekend has damaged that a bit...And I have been told they can just nudge you out of your rut and don't need to be taken forever (I have been slightly hesitant about taking the plunge (hex 29 came up last time I asked about them!) because I thought it'd be making depression more a part of me - but then it has been... for years... and perhaps this will help on a deeper level..Sorry all I know this is a long one and I have received great medical advice from some of you which I shall refer back to! But I'm interested in what you make of the repeated combo of hex 8 and hex 52.Could it be saying there is a mountain preventing me from making contact with people at the mo which could be at the root of my depression? The barrier that is there between me and truly communicating with others? Or myself? I feel like I become two dimensional around certain people or in groups.. but I just seem to have lost the ability to have fun! Or at least be myself... and talk...Thanks :bows:Last edited: Aug 23, 2009"
2259,"My brother mentioned he will get his PhD, but he is only in his maiden undergrad year. I asked the Oracle, if he will eventually do a doctorate, because he does not seem the studious sort. Wanted to know if he had the aptitude and attitude necessary.58,2,5,6>21What do you think? 58.2 looks favorable, but the rest?Another friend of mine also expressed an interest to pursue her doctorate. She is also nervous about it. I asked the oracle, if she will do her doctorate, and got 20.1.4.5.6, to 51.

2260,"A very well known spiritual teacher will be speaking at a relatively small gathering in about a week.  There will be just about 500 people attending the event is in the middle of nowhere and far from my home.  To attend I would have to buy airline tickets on short notice and visit a part of the US I have no interest in.  I also have work at home and some family cares.I feel drawn to see this man in person, but I know that I could travel 3000 miles and end up just watching him on closed circuit TV in a parking lot at the center.  For all that effort I might just as well stay home and see clips on You Tube.And yet, I obviously feel drawn here...I had dropped the idea of the trip but just this overcaffeinated morning I respectfully consulted the I Ching.  It seems like the result is speaking to my question, but as usual, I feel I can read it either way.Grateful for any insights from the board.  Thanks, S"
2261,"I'm trying to figure out whether I should invest in keeping connected to my father and stepmother for the sake of my children. After a couple of decades of personal anguish, I've accepted that my Dad isn't really capable of giving love. What I don't know is how much this matters in the experience of my children, given the fact that my father's home and resources can be a kid's fantasyland. I don't know how much of my experience growing up (occassionally lit with extravagant gifts and trips but generally full of a sense that I did not exist or have value) is something that could distort my ability to see opportunities for my children. When I asked whether I should try to nurture relationship with dad and stepmother, I drew hex 33 with line 6 changing, resulting in hex. 31. Any insight is appreciated. I get the pursuit of spiritual ritches that LiSe mentions in connection with line 6, but am not so sure about the rest. Insight about any aspect of this reading is appreciated."

2263,"Hello,Just needing clarification. I'm afraid in this situation I'm the main one to blame... it's about a misunderstanding (I think), which I've tried to explain (but I'm not clear on it myself).. I'm trying to be detached.Have I been understood? 33.3,4,6 > 39Does this say that the misunderstanding demands retreat and that is the only way to resolve it? or that one person wants to forget it and let it go but the other is obstructing that? 33.3 talks about the inferior refusing to let go the superior and thus degenerating through deprivation from the superior (33.4)...So I then asked is my friend the superior man described in hex 33?7.1,3,4,6 > 14 I'm thinking they are because it was my impulsiveness that caused the problem.Is it saying that yes - they possess self discipline?And in the first reading, does it suggest a retreat from someone because of not wanting to deal with the difficulties that have come up, even if there is an understanding of the others motives/perspective?Oh dear.I wish the voice of the ego/ emotions didn't override sometimes!!! (and usually at critical moments).So I also asked:Why does the voice of the ego dominate and cripple self-improvement so easily?38.1,3 > 50I think this is saying you shouldn't allow certain negative voices to influence you and not chase after what you think you should have or have lost in life (38.1) and that sometimes you feel like the world is against you (38.3) but this isn't true and/or is necessary to self-development. And hex 50 could be saying that the mind is like a cauldron containing opposing elements ie. the ego and the 'higher' self, and that ordeals that chasten and are not ideal will ultimately nourish you as you transform inferior characteristics or tendencies.Hmm.Grateful for any input on these especially the first two!:bows:"
2264,"Hello,I am grateful to anyone who can offer me insight into the meaning of a reading I did last night. I asked the I Ching 'What direction is my career headed?' and I got hexagram 1. The Creative, with a 9 in the second place, which gave me a second hexagram: 13. Fellowship with Men. On the whole I felt the reading was quite positive, since I am at the moment a struggling independent and unknown filmmaker. But I am a little unsure about exactly what it means.I consulted the Wilhel/Baynes version and one element of text in Book 3: The Commentaries that I found discouraging is the final note on page 456 that says 'None of them attains the ideal. All seek fellowship on the basis of narrower relationships. For this reason, none of them attains the great success that the hexagram as a whole envisions.'So once again, any feedback and insight is greatly appreciated.Thanks,ryfe"
2265,"Hello I hope someone can help me with this one. I asked the Yi what the man I have feelings for feels about me and I got 56.1,3 changing to 21.

2266,"So I took a small step by writing a sentence about my thoughts on psychopaths (not an accusatory one, but a vague one, yet to the point), where I know he can see it. I asked, how did he react to what I said? 45,2,4,>29.45,2,4 indicates a good fortune; 29 indicates danger. Well, he logged off. Did I make a mistake?I asked another question, more on semantics than anything. I asked, what did he _think_ of what I said? 39,2,6>57 looks like he feels obstructed and then went off (line 6) into his own world. 57 speaks of an influence.Last edited: Aug 21, 2009"

I know both lines contain strong warnings, but I'm not sure how to apply them to my question. It suggests I will have trouble at first if I don't say certain things outright? Before I asked this question, I was mostly thinking about men's magazines, so my guess is that if I don't swing my pitch letter in a way that appeals to women, I will run into trouble?E) Finally, I asked if there was anything I am unaware I need to do in order to succeed with this, and I got 47.1.4>60.(Mmmmm, I think this speaks of sacrifices in terms of social time, but also is a warning about not getting ahead of myself with hopes and fears???

2271,"I have a friend who is a liar and betrayer. The thing is she covers it up very well by acting innocent, which comes very naturally to her. Nevertheless, noone knows of her misdeeds, only me, because she betrayed me. I have seen firsthand how she pretended she did not do the things she did, and how she twisted the story, pretended nothing happened, gained support and got rid of her detractors. It has been a long time, almost 2 years. Still she has not been found out. Even my date thinks she is not guilty. she was trying to plant seeds of mistrust between me and the guy i was seeing for a long time. I told him about it but apparently he did not believe me because she is still his friend. Thus, she has managed to cause a huge rift between us because he thinks i am accusing her for nothing. i want to take action, but i dont know how. I asked if I start from little steps like writing it on msn messenger, my thoughts on betrayers.. how will my date react? It said 49,1,2,4>48.What is the I ching suggesting? It is very sad, to me, that the person that I love did not believe me the first time i told him, rather he chose to believe the betraying friend."
2272,"A gentleman asked me out for this evening. Not someone I intend to have any lasting relationship with, so I'm not sure what to do...do I go out and enjoy the company (which I do) or turn him down and just stay in?Background is I really liked him when I went out with him back in February (3 times), but then he disappeared for a few months. The last time I heard from him was two weeks ago. Clearly, this is a case of ""he's just not that into you."" But now it's mutual because of his disappearance, but I think we just enjoy each other's company (or maybe it's just to have company). Well, sort of. I noticed the last two times we went out that he whines quite a bit...kind of annoying. This is sort of a new place for me to be...after a long wrong marriage, and then another relationship failure, I kind of realized that my only criteria was that they like me, so I've been fixing that. p.s. there has not been any intimacy - I'm definitely not going there, and I think I made that clear the last time we went out...and then the 2 week silence, so I was surprised to hear from him.What do I need to know about ""him?    36What do I need to do about him? 35.4>23These two left me pretty confused. I searched the index for 35.4, and it's clear that other's get it, but I just don't. 23 says break away to me.Again, because I'm not clear, I asked, ""What if I turn him down?  10.3>1I get bitten. This is saying to me, ""don't turn him down."" Maybe there's something to learn here? What if I accept? 41The only thing that I can clearly see is the 10.3...can someone help me figure this out? I guess I will know soon, because I think I will accept."
2273,"I'm confronting some long-standing difficulties with an old relationship.It was a  relationship with someone who i worked with that had some romantic/friendship potential.What happened was that i left this situation/job - we got into argument regarding money, and he was blaming, very hurtful, didn't keep his word, lied, and I left angry. It was an awful end - really I've kind of been carrying around this anger/pain, for months. Months have passed, and I am working in the area, so I called to say hello.  He was kind - and we didn't speak very long.  I emailed him regarding coffee and he hasn't responded.I think I would like to actually speak with him directly, or at least write him, and let him know how I feel, but do not know if I should - So I asked the i ching a relationship question ( 3 part - my relationship to this situation, the situation as it stands, and his relationship to the situation).

2274,"This is a followup to this thread: http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=3418.I decided to keep taking small steps, so I decided to ask her out to do something.  I sent a txt msg: ""hey A!  What are you doing Monday evening?"".  She responded almost immediately: ""Heya I might be home (her family's home and not her apartment, which coincidentally where I also live), what's up?"".  I proceeded to invite her out to a jazz lounge, and I never received a response.It's been 2 days since now, so I asked the I Ching whether I should follow up with her.  I got 38.6 > 54 -- Opposition turning into the Marrying Maiden.  My interpretation is that she is wary of me and my intentions.  In the past I have been known to play the field a bit but with her my intentions are pure.  What I'm not sure about is whether there is anything I should be doing to remedy this misconception or not.  This reading seems to imply that there is nothing for me to do but wait.I asked the I Ching to confirm this for me so I asked, ""So I should do nothing, right?"".  I got 58.6 > 10.I live in the same building as she does so inevitably I will run into her.  How should I behave when that happens?  Should I confront her about it or act as if nothing has happened?"

He made a huge fuss and I found myself laughing from my heart....but I was with the understanding that he was linked with a friend of mine (an imaginary friend because it was no one in my reality) so the whole time I was mentioning her and politely pulling away saying something like ""I'll see you around..."" BUT he kept pulling me towards him in a big embrace and we were both laughing and happy (yeah flirting big time). And I was quietly surprised and just felt that great tingle  I felt really safe in his embrace - like a trusting, genuine safe. It was a great feeling.

I asked the Yi what are my chances of success and drew hexagram 21 without moving lines (twice!).

2280,"so, back again and thought I'd share a reading that had me perplexed before leaving for my holidays -and I am talking about the big, bald, brash 1.2,3,5 going to 21 I had . .I mean, OUCH! 21 is not a favorite of mine, I get a feeling of someone trying to grasp my insides using a pair of pincers each time I get it . . As you can tell, I was not very happy about it and tried to figure it out beforehand . . Yi kept giving me readings with 9 when I asked for more and my dumb dumb doo be doo me could only think of the cruel greek sun which can be unforgiving to mindless sunbathers . . well, I think I made Yi burst into laughter with my idea cause it gave me a straight 16 when I asked it (ok, ok Yi, 9, I can't know now, have to wait and see little things taking place and taking care)So I was careful and vigilant but didn't expect what went down . .First thing was a series of strokes of bad luck: moored on a beautiful place and immediately got attacked by hornets, lot's of them, got stung myself on day one (grr) . . anyway, no sting left in my foot, just a bit of pain, no big deal. We learned to live with them, after we send lot's to swim in the sea (ever played tennis with hornets? two things happened once in water: either they made a couple of swirls and flew again or little fish grabbed and ate them- nature taking care of its own). By the end I 'd just brush them aside gently and go on with whatever I was doing. We even put out a bowl of water for them which took them some time to discover (not very clever, huh). Funny thing was they stung us again the day we were leaving -what first you attack us to leave and now you get sore for us leaving? oh man . . They did sting twice my mother, left their stings in, which I later had to take out using a clean needle . . 21 it is!)Next BIG strokes of bad luck . . My father's favorite pastime for the last 40 years or so has been fishing. So he got his new dingy and engine and left to fish . . came back after dark with a rapala hook on his left hand . . he was fishing for a baraccuda-like fish -very nervous- which got away leaving him hooked instead . . he's gotten hooked like that before on his thigh but that was fishing tuna . . ok the hook was in for good and the only way to get it out was to pierce thru the flesh on an exit point and cut the hook's edge (no other way to get a hook out cause it might rip you badly) . . GOSH these 9s can do some real damage!! Luckily we got it out alright .. As if that wasn't enough, 2 days later he goes out again -he has to get that fish you see! He comes back with a bucket full and the new rapala hook he had replaced, this time hooked on the little finger of is right hand  . . This time it was really messy, lots of blood and pain . . good thing the hook had exited his flesh already which meant he didn't have to do it -he wouldn't be able too with his left hand . . Like last time i had to help him since I'm the one who can keep cool under stress and not being too squeamish abt blood . . but that hook was new and too strong and hard to cut . . and i had to be swift and strong even though I feared of ending up with part of his finger in my hands . . . . yes, right, 21 . .ok, was that enough for you? it was for us women on deck, so we didn't let him go out for coming days -we even agreed to learn play 'bridge' to keep him in, and let me tell you, none of us three girls is really adept at card games, oh well, we had some good laughs there just to top this off rather mildly, I think there was another case of quite different 21 too . . some days into our hanging out in that place, there comes a boat which chooses out of all the empty cove we were, to anchor just about where our anchor was, and does it really badly . . well, guess what happened . . it got our anchor unhooked, which had us doing the whole mooring thing again -no big deal, just annoying when you just want to cool and the wind is quite strong . . That got a whole discussion going about which would be best anchor to buy for the tough mediterranean seabed and my father even discovered an old english article in some magazine which I had to translate for him (in case you're interested, a Spade anchor was the winner of this guy's research). Was thinking then that 21 with its 3 spikes does look like an anchor and I remembered how 21 is also about market browsing and investigation hmmm . .lastly, I, at one point, asked Yi, what would be my part in this 1/21 reading . . got 22.4,6 to 55 . . thinking abt Lise's healing translation of it, it made perfect sense . .heh, I think I've spoken enough for the past days of absence here huh Would love to read any more ideas or stories on 21 if you wish to share . ."
2281,"I asked about how this (new, still at friendship stage) relationship would go in the next year, and got 44.1 changing to 1.  44 is Coming to Meet (Blofeld calls it ""Contact"").  44.1 says: ""It must be checked with a brake of bronze.  Perseverance brings good fortune.  If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.  Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around."" Because it is not feasible for the relationship to develop on the romantic plane at this time, 44.1 must mean not to let it overstep those bounds, no matter how tempting.  But what does hexagram 1 mean in this context?  Perhaps that if one resists temptation, then it can be a very productive and meaningful friendship?What do you all think?"

Barely legal, I know...) - but as to the question of whether he'll change his mind and go for me... 49 lines 4.5. - yeah, baby, ride me like a tiger?Though could not resist the last cheeky comment, am looking forward to any funny or serious comments you may care to make!

2286,"hey there,i have been consulting the i ching for several years now and then, and i used to have a clue about what to do with the result; but now, i am stuck.my situation: a year ago, i lived in total depression and apathy, but i managed to crawl out of that, i am now living with three jobs. i'm really busy with that but happier than before.in my main job i have a new boss now who keeps bullying me and demanding more and more... i'm really working nonstop, but he just wants more. i'm very unhappy, but i'm not sure what to do. i can't just quit, i need the money.so i asked the i ching what to do with that job!i ching gave me 28.1.2.4. means: all is ****ed up now (and it's my own fault anyway), be prepared for the worst, you did it all wrong, but prepare anyway, you could succeed...but ,in the end, all will fail anyway (63).or: d it?id i expect too much and expect too much? (28)in the end, 28 means, it's all too much for me now, doesn't it?should i quit?i am confused and desperate, please give your opinion"
2287,"Hi guys,I asked the iching about a woman I just met. To me she had a very strange vibe. I asked:What does she want from me? 39.6>53"
2288,"i've asked an advice about someone i met these days. We are fine together spending an evening every 2-3 days, he is warm and shows interest in me, but i'm pretty unsure about any involvement...the answer was : 1.1.5-50what is its message? take this opportunity or keep your emotional independence? (cause i think, for the moment , he seems the most active ...,not me)thank you for any idea !"
2289,"Hi,I have a male friend that has become distant towards me for some reason. I tried to email him asking him why.. he told me that he has a lot of things going on and that he was very sorry if he hurt me in someway and that even tho he has a %^*% way of showing it.. he has a special place in his heart for me... well that was a month ago and he is still not talking to me. I fear that I might of said something to hurt his feelings , but I cannot image what that would of been. We go not fight.I asked Is X purposely pushing me away ?      35  1.3 6  going to 55What was my responsibity in his distance towards me ?   59.4  going to 6what can i do that would benitit both of us   6.2 going to 12Any insight would be greatly appricated, right now, I just don't know what to do.Thank you"
2290,"Hi again  I have lots happening at the moment so I hope you all don't mind all the questions that keep coming!!Earlier this week I sent a friendly but work related email to an ex friend S who is a newspaper journalist, asking if he'd be interested in doing a story about a film director friend of mine's new feature film (the same guy as my other post today). I say ""ex"" friend only because we stopped contact about five years ago after an ex boyfriend and I had an unfriendly break up - I lost the friendship essentially because he was good friends with my ex and had been for years and it all just got too hard, whereas I only knew S for about 18 months. We had a good rapport though and bonded through a band we were in (he had invited me into the band) and he seemed to have a soft spot for me (not in a romantic way - he was married).I'm at odds as to whether I should follow the email request with a phone call or just leave the whole thing be........it's a bit tricky because normally as part of the publicity game journos expect you to pursue them, and I wouldn't hesitate to follow up with a call if it was someone else..........but because of our past connection and it being so long since we last spoke, there's a question mark hanging as to whether I should just leave it at that one friendly email..........yet maybe he's expecting me to do what i would normally do with my publicist hat on??? So I asked the IC earlier this week""Is S going to respond to my email?""I got 5 unchanging which I assumed to mean wait, he will respond?? But it could have also meant he's waiting with confidence as to whether to respond i.e. he holds the power card???I asked the same question again tonight, only because I wanted to be sure and there's every chance he could change his mind from day to day and I wanted to tap into whether that was the case......I got 36 unchanging which totally threw me  and I couldn't see how that fit in with the question, so I asked the IC....""Sorry this doesn't seem to make sense IC....could I please ask again is S going to respond to my email?""I got 25.1 > 12I also asked ""Should I just wait for S to respond or should I pursue the request further by calling him?""I got 38 unchangingAs always any help interpreting is much appreciated.....sofia :bows:"
2291,"Hello again fellow seekers I've asked the IC ""Do I have to wait much longer?"" (about a relationship wish)I got 20 unchangingSince this hex is about contemplation as well as ""being seen"" or being an example (Wilhelm) it doesn't really answer my straight forward questions (or does it?) - any help is appreciated.In terms of it possibly being a time answer....Wilhelm says this hex is linked with the eight month (September-October). But adds...""However, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a whole"" Why is that so when there is the Blofield method using the Chinese calendar???PLUS I did look that calendar up and 20 does relate to the 8th month BUT for 2009 wouldn't that be 26 August to 25 September (i.e. 26 Jan to 25 Feb being the 1st month)......Maybe I'm just reading into things but I had also asked earlier today....""Can you please give me a date as to when X is thinking of approaching me or even laying down some bait?"" and I got 26.1.6 > 46 which translated into calendar terms 26.1 = 13 Aug and 26.6 = 18 AugWhile those dates don't exactly add up for both questions - they are pretty damn close! Anyone??thanksSofia :bows:"
2292,"The newspapers lately have brought news of the twists and turns of the Health Care Reform debate in the U.S. Congress growing to a crescendo with the impending August recess and Pres. Obama's deadline for passing a suitable bill by each chamber before they leave the Capitol building for their home districts.First I asked the Yi about the success of the Health Care Reform bills:Hex 44 without moving lines. Which I took to describe Nancy Pelosi consorting with the various male Congressmen looking for agreement on a bill.That seemed intriguing, insightful, but not very promising for the result this week...So I cast again on the specific question of the final result of the negotiations this week in both houses:Hex54.1,2,3,4 >> Hex 15 or in Flux Tome Names Chasing Rainbows>> Churning.Hex 54 is about individual lust taking respectable form in the various marriage options for a youngest daughter who has intrigued the fancy of an oldest son.  Each line can be seen as describing the course of political negotiations in sequence from first to 4th line.In Wilhelm, hex 15 has a totally favorable impression from the high value Modesty held for Confucian commentaries.Gia-fu, in normal oracle use referred to hex 15 as close to hex 2 and thus referring to emptiness or zero or nothing there.In my structural approach, hex 15 has all focus upon the third line of personal passion with these passions completely isolated or purified by all the open Yin places.In our local Las Vegas newspaper, they note that our three Rep. all voted NO on current bills. The Republican complained, that if the so-called government run public option is so great the bill should require all members of Congress to sign up. They have their health care through a Federal program which was one of the first public options considered to be opened up to all Americans. Members rejected that as not wanting to share their great plan with the mere  common folk or hoi polloi the people of the pollis of Athens who voted in their democracy.One Democrat whose district has many elderly, felt the bill was a ""bass-awkward"" approach and should put more emphasis upon end-of-life care than on prevention.The other Democrat supports covering the uninsured, but not by taxing the folks in her district making more than $350K annually.Our Senators are Sen Majority Leader Harry Reid and Casino Johnny Ensign of the C Street convent which the paper political cartoon noted, should resign, but as our even sleazier gov would appoint his replacement should no resign... How would you interpret these Yi Oracles of Hex 44 >> Hex 44And Hex 54.1,2,3,4 >>Hex 15?"
2293,"Hi again!I'm sorry to bother everyone. I'm new to the I Ching and I have a hard time figuring out some of the answers I receive from it.Here's the situation:He is in a relationship. Nothing happened between us, but there are lots of glances and smiles. There is definitely an attraction. But everytime I try to talk to him, it seems like he's afraid of something or like he wants to run away. I then take some distance, but after awhile, we look at each other again and smile. The situation really bothers me.That's why I ask lots of questions about him to the I Ching.Here are the questions and answers:Q1: What does he want from me?A1: 32.3 > 40Q2: Does he want to go further with me?A2: 39.1.2.6 > 9Q3: When he looks at me, what does it mean?A3: 40.1.5 > 58I can't figure it out, but it seems negative a little bit.

2294,"I have just spent the weekend at a corporate event with my boyfriend. One of the hosts was overtly flirtatious and over-friendly towards him yet cold towards me to the point that I felt uncomfortable and expressed so. I do have issues with trust – to start with - which R is aware (I'm doing what I can to deal with it), I had knots in my tummy the whole time. My partner tried to reassure me by being affectionate with me in front of her (I was surprised as he is not normally like this).   He reassured me that there was nothing going on – there never has been and that she actually likes his friend – but there was nothing in it for him.  She continued to flirt with him for the entire weekend; at one point requesting to hang out with him at a 4 day business event to take place in October. My partner explained that he would be very busy and maybe they could do lunch at the event- to which she looked disappointed. At this point I disappeared to the loo to take some deep breaths. When I returned they both looked very cheerful. At the end of the event - another of R's business associates came to say goodbyes and said to my boyfriend - ""oh when M is back in town - the 3 of us should all go out for a catch up drink"" (she lives in another country) - to which I was astonished as to why this associate would associate the 2 of them together - R said he must have made a mistake and he couldnt help that and he had no idea why he thought he would be going out with a drink with M - as the nature of their work does not coincide that way.The company have had past events to which my BF has not normally invited me to – this was the first for this company. He tells me he has I have many questions whirling round in my head – but the chosen one was:What is the relationship between R and MG?I received 36.1 .3 to 2I have thought a great deal about this to the point where it could now mean absolutely anything – such as a temporary darkening of their happiness whilst I am around – but given time as bit more or, my light has darkened because of those 2.I would be very grateful for any feedback at all  - your opinion on what I am being told.

2295,"Hi,I am new here and I'm very excited to be on this forum.  For a while, I have observed this forum for insights.  Some insights were right on where some a bit confusing.  Anyway on with my question.  I asked clarity i-ching this question:  why will Lawrence and I meet? Received 37.1.3.6 to 8Backaground: I found out about a couple of months ago from a tarot card reader that him and I would be meeting up again.

I feel like there are walls around me.Anti-depressants have finally been suggested, but I am reluctant, and I think my reading on the matter reflects this:51.3,6 > 30Is this saying that sometimes shock requires intervention (51.3 > 'If one spurs to action'?)Or that I shouldn't listen to others (51.6) and deal with it with faith that things will get better? (hex 30 I think talks about needing to get comfort from something higher - not earthly things?What is your impression here? Would anti-depressants release me?

2297,"I am in a marriage that has been embattled almost from the start. Recently, my husband shared some embarrassing information about me to those that he knows I have no reason to trust, and in a manner that feels like a profound act of betrayal. He did it because he feels like his own reputation is compromised for reasons that have nothing to do with me. I take loyalty very seriously, and have been extremely circumspect  regarding some fairly awful behavior on his part. Although I know that he did what he did out of weakness rather than malice, I don't know if I can trust him again. I drew Hex 28.2 on feeling like I could not trust him. The forum discusses this in terms of ""rejuvenation"" but I read on LiSe's website that it refers to the knowledge that ""winter always follows summer..."". Any insight is appreciated."

When we're together he shows he's interested in me, but then he dissapears for a week, doesn't send texts, calls, anything... i think if you're really interested there's sth inside yourself that makes you move, so i see that his words and acts are a contradiction.

2299,"Does 17.4.5 indicate my feelings (complex, unsettled but love-like) are reciprocated?I realize some feel asking the I Ching this sort of question is the equivalent of reading someone's diary, but obviously that didn't stop me. My initial read is that this is a positive throw, since what I want is for him to take me seriously, i.e. not be just trifling. We've been courting in stop-start fashion for several months, and have a shared aversion to ""being more vulnerable than necessary.""Thanks for any insight. Generally I like getting 17 & especially line 5 but in this case I am not sure whether I am being advised to take the lead, relinquish it or otherwise."

2307,"Hi again I would really appreciate some help with these answers from the IC.....a quick background to the story....... I've had lots of email contact this week with a young guy I met last year while I was living in Melbourne (I was helping out on set with a film he wrote and was directing). He's a gorgeous guy and beautiful soul and we seemed to have a lovely connection even though I'm 15 years his senior (although he didn't know my age). We didn't really socialise beyond the film set nor did we really get to know each other or keep up any contact this past year after I returned to Sydney. The reason we're back in contact is because he's screening his film in Sydney and I've offered to help him out with some promotional stuff and getting friends along to the screening etc. The communication has been lovely and friendly and smooth and he keeps telling me how much he appreciates that I'm doing this. I think I've mentioned this before on this site, I look a lot younger than I am - the feedback is regularly that I look 15 years younger and am always surprising people when they find out my real age! I guess I'm a bit of a young soul too  And I've been a bit worried that D might be keen on me thinking I'm a lot younger. I could be totally imagining it too ........so in my last email to D I yapped on about publicity stuff and found a way to mention that I was a Generation X-er and much older than the film characters (which are 20ish) etc. so that at least he'd know.......So I asked the IC""What did D think of my email about me being a Gen X-er?""I got 53 unchanging which I couldn't apply to this?? So I asked again....""Could you please clarify this further IC?""I got 23.2 > 4I then asked ""Does D think of me as a love interest?"" I got 24.2.5 > 60which from other posts I took to mean that he would consider me hard work and there would be limits??In order to get a better idea of whether I was just imagining things or whether he would in fact consider an older woman (not that I would necessarily go there) I also asked ""Would he care about a 15 year age difference?""I got 63.4 > 49which warns about finding rags amongst the silk (a yucky analogy maybe for an older woman??) or just a line about caution??Any help interpreting is appreciated as always :bows:Sofia"
2308,"Greetings all,I've been reading quite  a bit here and you all seem so friendly.  But I must admit that I'm very new to all this (and a bit skeptical - hope that you don't take that the wrong way).I am curious tho - I used the ""online I-Ching Reading"" to ask a single question.  Basically I asked ""Is the research I'm doing related to <personal subject> on track?""  What I got as a result, I'm sorry, I don't seem to understand.  (I suppose in all fairness the question was not only about the subject of the research and whether I should continue researching, but whether the research is significant/important enough for me to continue moving forward with too.)Primary - 25Relating - 17Moving Line(s) - 6I tried to read some of the beginner/introductory text - but am still quite confused.

2309,"Last April I had some surgery done in my right foot. It takes a long time to recover completely from it yet I am worried sometimes because I think that my foot is not ok, people say it is normal but I have that bad feeling that I won't be able to walk properly again. I had a bunion or hallux valgus and some problems in my foot sole. They removed the hallux valgus and fixed every single toe, but after the operation I can see that the hallux valgus was not removed completely and I cannot walk properly because my big toe is quite rigid and it hurts a little. I asked the IC some questions:What is happening to my foot /wrong with my foot? 18 (4, 6) changing to 32. What should I do about it? 39 (2, 3) changing to 29.What should I do so that my foot gets better? 5 (3, 6) changing to 61.On the other hand, I also asked the IC about a friend of mine I am going to work with in the same school. I asked What should I do so our relationship does not deteriorate? I got 34 (5) changing to 43.Thank you so much."
2310,"Hi,I received an offer to get a permanent position today. However, it is a completely different job than what I am doing right now. It's more far from where I live also. But it's the same salary. I'm thorn apart because I love my job right now and the people I work with, but there is probably no way I will ever get a permanency there. I feel I need to accept the offer and that I can't turn it down, but I'm afraid I won't like it as much as I love my job right now and I won't like the people as much as I love my colleagues right now. If it would have been me, I would have stayed there forever. But I'm under a contract and they don't want to get permanent people. I know there are going to offer some permanency in my team, but I don't think I have a chance to get it since I've only been working there since September 2008. Then again, I don't know what their criteria are when it comes to them giving the permanency. I know I would get called back after the end of my contract, but I could get layed off at anytime and they did in the past quite often. I don't feel I can take the risk, but... I'm really thorn apart by this. I'm happy and sad at the same time because I don't want to go.

2311,"Hello everyone I hope you are all well! My question for the oracle is about a friendship that ended abruptly about a year ago. It did not complete on particularly good terms, and I felt very sad about it, but the time was not right to try and salvage anything. I have been thinking about how I can make peace, and yesterday I finally worked up the courage to email my friend to say that I was sorry for the part I had played in the breakdown of our friendship. I went on to mention that it would be good to make peace and to ask if he felt the same way. I have no ulterior motives, all I want is for any enmity to be dissolved and the opportunity to go our separate ways knowing that we have the each others best interests at heart. A spiritual peace if you like.-----------------------------------------------------------------------So I put the following two questions to the IChing -Question 1 Is he going to reply?  38.2 > 21I looked this up in my Wu Wei book and 38.2 speaks of alienation and the possibility of resolving misunderstandings and mending the relationship. But this turns into 21 which talks of punishment to prevent further offences. Does this mean that my friend will be likely to say nothing to punish me? Question 2How does he feel about making peace with me? 9.1.2 > 59According to Wu Wei hexagram 9 is concerned with Gentle Restraint. It says the time of advance is not at hand and it is better to stop yourself. The second moving line goes on to say that the advance is not in harmony with the time and pushing on will mean being lost in difficulties. Hexagram 59 talks about dispersal and the beginnings of a dangerous situation that is getting worse, then it goes on to say that you will have no regrets about having taken the appropriate action.Is this bad or good? Could someone please break this down for me as I am very confused. I don't think the peaceful mission looks good at all. ThanksPetalx"

2313,"Hello,I've been taking fish oils (omega 3 capsules) for about a month now. We all have heard they're supposed to be good for the brain and joints - but also recently read they are beneficial if you suffer from depression - because they enhance your serotonin receptors or something..I'm taking the full dose at the mo. Feel quite happy today, but of course have been very up and down. Anyway, that's just me and can't really say I've seen an improvement since taking them... physically or emotionally.. but then who knows?.. I asked the Yi Does taking fish oils help?34.4 >11I liked the image of a great man being like 'a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle'..So could that be saying well oiled innards yields better movement!?  Or that the strength of your body depends on your inner core ie emotions and attitudes etc?Hmmm....

2314,"Hi again I also am having trouble seeing this line clearly.7 The Army line 5...I asked two Q's on the same theme and this line came up.Q1 Is my path straight?(As in should I dedicate myself to one subject/career-path (though I cringe at this phrase because it's not clear cut for most of us... not for a while anyway... unless you're one of those people born with a firm belief that you're here to do one thing).7.5 > 29Seems encouraging because it says there is game in the field. One particular thing I should be 'hunting'? - seems to say concentrate on one thing: 'It furthers one to hold fast, to catch'But then it also talks of someone immature trying to take the lead leading to misfortune... so perhaps it is saying I'm not mature enough to know? (and so drive the carriage? (of my life that is))Q2 Should I participate in this course?(I'm interested in what it's about but not sure the people would be my age group etc..it's only a short course, but it is quite expensive)7.1,3,5 > 5I think this is saying I would need to be sure (7.1 : a just cause must exist before committing to action), and there would need to be a good leader (7.3) and then again, 7.5..... Perhaps it's saying I'm not ready to take the driving seat here again?Then changing to hex 5 says to me I need to wait and see - then it'll become clear whether this is the right kind of nourishment - or that there is something better or more appropriate that I don't know of yet..Thanks for reading. I know the subject of career paths can be tricky and it's just as good not to commit because maybe then you have more life experience and are freer to meet different people etc.. rather than get stuck on the ladder... but that might also feel good!Does 7.5 simply say that there is something - game - to pursue - but I need to be older to see that more clearly? :bows:"

""Hmmm..... so if I leave, I will be a free individual, and this will show the b****rd?  Any takers for this one?Comments are appreciated as always!:bows:"

2318,"Greetings everyone,I recently had a job interview at a place where I have done part time work for the past three years.  There was a full-time opening last fall, and I applied with no success.  An opening re-appeared this month and I applied again and asked for guidance ...Received 24 Fu, with no changing lines.  After deep reflection, strong preparation and a great interview, I came back to the image the following week, trying to see what would transpire while I waited for their phone call.  It felt right.  So much of the text seemed to mirror all the positive qualities of the interview.  The phone call came and I did not get the job.  Since then I've been wondering, what then does 24 seem to tell me in this situation?Any insight would be appreciated.Sincerely,Schastlivchik"
2319,"Guys, how do I treat hexagrams 8.2.4 to 12 as an advice?  I currently live in a tiny appartment with my son and my mum and am desperate to move to something bigger but I cannot get more mortgage at the moment due to my low wages (Im currently trying to sell the appartment). I've asked ""how can I make it possible to move to a bigger house?"".  How does hexagram 12 work as a piece of advice?  Has anyone got any experience with this combination? Many thanks, BX"
2320,"Just kidding, sorry fellas.I do have three questions, but sadly, they're G-rated.My questions relate to an article I'm writing. The main subject matter is solid, but I'm not quite sure how much personal information I need or want to include about myself. Most importantly, my goal with this article is to have it published on a national scale, so ""success"" is nothing short of reaching that goal, and all my questions are posed in an effort to ""succeed.""1) What will result if I include a lot of personal information in the article?29.3.5>462) What will result if I write from an unemotional p.o.v without including my personal life?7.1.2.6>273)What can I do to complete the article faster?6.3>44The only one I have an inkling about is the last one...I believe it says that if I spend time thinking about the people for whom I'm writing (lower-class, less fortunate) rather than about what I have to gain as a writer, I will write faster?The other two answers seem to reflect my questions, but don't mean much to me as far as answering them."
2321,I just met someone.  I want to know what's her impression on me and iching gave mehex 19 with hex 7 as relating hexagram.I'm confuse with hex 7 shish/the army.  Is this good?possibility of seeing her again?
2322,"So, this is a little bit of a mixture of two kinds of divination but if anyone could help me to understand this I would appreciate it.My love life has been disastrous lately with a guy I was interested in telling me that he is dating someone else casually, etc...Anyway, I laid out a celtic cross for my love life over the following six months and in the near future recieved two of pentacles.  I always have such a hard time understanding this card, so I consulted the iching and asked: what will the two of pentacles mean to me in the near future?  It gave me hexagram 38 lines 2,3, 5, and 6 changing to 49.  Line 2 talks about two people of the same nature belonging together now apart but an informal meeting will clear up the understanding. Line 3 says not a good beginning but a good end. Lines 5 and 6 talk about failing to recognize a companion. I have a feeling that this is talking about my estrangement with Will (the guy) even though I wasn't asking specifically about him.  Oh and the final outcome in the celtic cross was two of cups, just an fyi if there are any tarot experts out there. Could someone help me with this reading?  Thanks"
2323,"Don't know where this will go, but I've been stewing about such things as Facebook for ages and thinking long ludditely thoughts about my stash of stationery/paper and art supplies now gathering dust.Here's the broad concept: for months I've been thinking of sending letters or cards out to everyone I know. I want to work down my collection and I want desperately to send REAL mail to their homes. You know, the kind of handmade and/or handwritten thing that you'd give good money for these days to show up in your mailbox. (Or at least I'd give good money for such a thing!) FB just gets me right in my authenticity craw.But I needed a theme.Thinking about it today, very much so. Decided to ask the Yi, but as I was preparing to ask, I realised my theme --the Yi Jing! Anyway, the Yi's take on the general idea is 19.2,4-51.From LiSe's site:9 at 2:    With affection nearing.   Auspicious. There will be harvest.Help stays weak if one is not able to live free and strong oneself. Only who is an egoist in essential life values can be a true altruist. And don't give help where it is wasted. Help those who are able to use spiritual help or enough spirit to use material help in a positive way.(Changes to hex.24)6 at 4:   To the highest degree nearing. Without    fault.Everybody has to live his own life, so grant everyone his own Tao. His decisions, his way of life, his death. Acknowledge it as part of his being, do not withdraw and do not try to make it fit your own convictions 'for his own good'.(Changes to hex.54)​After getting the reading, I began imagining a series of cards, each featuring a hexagram (or even a real reading?!). I'd collect all the addys of folks who want to participate and then randomly select a hexagram card to send each one.What to you folk think? And who wants to play along? "
2324,"Hi there,I have a question about hexagram 26I received this in relation to a situation I have with some neighbors. 26/3,5 -> 61What does this mean ? (parts in red, in context) THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.Perseverance furthers.Not eating at home brings good fortune.It furthers one to cross the great water.To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.    ~ Wilhelm/RabelaisClick to expand...Not very clear about this and can't find what I am looking for.Anyone have any good experience with this in a reading, or know something about the meaning generally?It is a neighbor (couple) I am trying to distance myself from gradually and not necessarily altogether, but it has been difficult as I have worked for them and they have continued to seek me out.  I am basically avoiding them and I am sure it is becoming clearer to them.   I had hoped it would have been more gradual.  And now it feels uncomfortable.  I don't want to be on bad terms with them, but there just needs to be some lines drawn here ... it's difficult.Thanks  "
2325,"Hello,At the moment I'm in need of an escape. There's a way this could be done, but whether or not my personality could cope is another question. It would be a position best suited to an extrovert, but not necessarily - I think also, it's a question of inherently, you either can do it well or you can't (it's teaching) - it would also be in another country, so not as much pressure but then there's the rest that comes with that leap.I asked what qualities would I need to cultivate to do this?59.4,5,6 > 40As a sentence this says the obvious - liberate yourself from your ego and only then can you help others.. etc. Or should I be heeding the warnings of the individual lines especially line 6 which basically means removing yourself from a situation or idea before blood is shed? I have always thought I wouldn't be suited to it, but if I put my mind to it.. and I do want to get away.. and I feel I just need a goal in mind - especially one where there would be opportunities to meet new people, and get out there again...I then asked would I be capable?31.1,3,6 > 1Either, in imop, saying if you take it seriously - commit - look at it from a less superficial level and put my money where my mouth is - go on a course etc, then I could muster up the yang energy needed to succeed in the venture? It would up the ante in my life, which feels ground to a halt.Or could it be saying I am not taking this seriously - it isn't my path - find where my real energy lies? let the idea go? It's just that in the past I have often put myself in situations probably not suited to my nature, and which have surprised others, and though challenging I have always learnt a lot - if only what I'm not good at or should avoid, in some cases.If anyone can help here I would be v grateful and don't be worried about being too honest as to sway my decision - though the Yi informs my decisions, if I still feel I want to do something I will, and obviously the Yi mostly illuminates the moments, and perhaps the answer to Q 2 just reflects my current state. If I were asking from a more confident position then it might give a different answer. But I guess essentially what I wanted to know was whether this is a viable option? I am hoping to do a bit of travelling next year with a friend, and doing this too could fit in nicely, but I don't know if I could do it well, and thus whether it wouldn't end up being more damaging..But then there's a quote from Marilyn Monroe: 'Did you ever notice 'What the hell' is always the right answer?'I like that - but at the same time, if I was awful at it, I would obviously feel bad for myself and employers Thanks for reading :bows:"
2326,"Hello,I really need some help regarding an interpretation. I have had a crush on this guy for about six months now. Nothing has really happened between us (mainly due to my reluctance to get involved with him since I don't know what his true feelings for me are) but we keep in touch. The problem is that he is sending me mixed signals. When he sees me in person (though this mostly happens by chance, since we move in similar circles), he continuously stares at me all night, then finally comes to talk to me. Our conversations are always intense, with much flirtation and sparks flying all over.  Then, when we talk via internet, he mostly seems distant and  sometimes even like a totally different person. One of such conversations occured a couple of days ago, when I chated him up on the net, so I decided to ask the Yi why he behaved this way again, and I got hex 11 with moving lines 1, 3 and 6, changing to hexagram 4. I'm pretty confused about the answer... Could it be that he just wants to keep the peace and harmony in his life and sees me as a threat? The fact that it changes to hex 4 could imply that he thinks this relationship is based on unreal expectations... Please help me out...It is also worth mentioning that he has a girlfriend, but their relationship seems to be more about continuity than passion. I heard he also had some rough experiences in the past.Anyway, after that I asked the Yi why he behaved this way towards me in general, just to clarify the first answer, and I got hex 51 with moving line 3, changing to hex 55. Now I'm even more confused. I would really appreciate your comments on this, as I've been pondering on those questions for quite a while now. Thank you so much! P.S. I also appologize for any spelling and grammar mistakes, since English is not my native language.Last edited: Aug 3, 2009"
2327,"Yi often refers to the great man, superior man etc.  I understand when it says something like the superior man does such and such that it is advising how to behave, but what about when it says see the great man?  How do you know who that is?  I was asking about my prospects for obtaining a teaching job this year, with the idea of maybe I was on the wrong path, that I should be doing something else, and got 39.6.  I read this as saying that though there are obstructions they will clear eventually and that this is the correct path for me to take.  The last I got from Wilhelms translation about not turning your back on the world and adhering to duty.  I got into teaching because I wanted to motivate and inspire the next generation to be something more.However, it also advises to see the great man, which I take as saying to take advice from someone or perhaps someone I should be speaking to about getting a job, but how do I know who that is and if it is someone who is even accessible to me?  Any thoughts???"
2328,"I am almost sure someone I liked and who I thought was fond of me spoke against me? They witnessed a situation in which i know I let my emotions get the best out of me and I acted stupidly. I understand since this person was a witness that they felt they could not lie but I think they also said things they could have left out. I put myself in their shoes and because I liked that person I would have been obligated to say the truth but I would say the bare minimum. I asked the I ching. Why did this person speak against me?I received Hexagram 32, Perserverence/ Duration lines 2 and 5. Relating hexagram 31 Mutual Influence/Attraction. I am trying to determine if they were a hypocrite towards me and never really liked me or if they changed their mind about me and why. Since I sincerely liked the person I would not have disliked them for making the same mistake I made."
2329,"Hi again I asked the IC a question about a person who at one stage I believed was suspicious of my character (but can't really be sure). He seemed extra cautious about people in general - like he was extra sensitive plus he claimed he was a Buddhist and that he was ""conservative"" so I wasn't surprised to get that feeling from him, but it was unwarranted. Some time has passed since we first met and I'm still not really sure what he thinks - we hardly see each other but he is in friends' circles and I'm asking about him because I do think about him and would like to be friends in the future if I knew that he felt the same and more importantly, felt comfortable with me.So I asked the IC....""Does Y really still have doubts about my character?""I got 52.6 leading to 15Not sure if asking ""still"" was making assumptions that he did in fact have doubts in the first place??In any case, any clarity on 52.6 is welcome.ThanksSofia :bows:"

Does this mean not to even consider the lines much, but focus more on the two Hexagrams?  What do you think the message here is?  Advice, insight, and thoughts are most welcome and appreciated!~Namaste~"
2331,"If anyone could help me with this dilemma I would be grateful.  I am in an emotional quagmire with a man that I thought I could trust.  I found out that he went out on a date with another woman, because he told me.  I have written an email telling him how it makes me feel and then consulted the iching.First question, I asked: What will happen between me and Will after I send this email to him?  It gave me hex 49 changing at lines 3 and 6 to 25.  Is this telling me to hold off from sending the email because of misfortune to me? On Lise's website (I hope that I have your name spelled correctly) line 3 tells me that I demand that things be set right and line 6 speaks of being content with the results. I am a little confused at how this all fits in with hexagram 25.Second question (which should have been my first).  I asked: Should I send the email to Will? I don't usually ask yes or no questions as I think it doesn't work as well that way, but I am not thinking as clearly as I should.  Anyway, it gave me hexagram 37 changing at lines 4 and 6 to hex 49 again!!!  I know the lines talk of the woman being the jewel of the house and it is auspicious in the end but what does it all mean changing to 49? Please someone help me with this.  Willowfox has been gracious in the past but I didn't want to overburden them with yet another question.  Thanks so much in advance."

2333,"Hello Everyone, I appreciate the help I have received from you. If you don't mind, I have another (2 actually)that is conflicting, and I'm not sure if I am seeing it correctly. Here's the background:My HELOC Mortgage company contacted me about a modification. I am not behind, so I'm not sure where it is coming from, except that it is an ARM that can fluctuate monthly. Two years ago, I did inquire of a modification, just because of fluctuating interest rates, and I could not refinance due to dropping property values and stricter refinance policies, but again, I have never been late on a payment. This gentlemen told me that if I paid approx 1/2 of my HELOC payment (he gave me a fixed amt), after 3 months my loan would be sent for review for possible loan modification, but I had to tell them right there on the phone that I am interested. I am very suspicious, so I would not give him any of my ID info at first (he contacted me!), but he gave me a number to reach him. I searched the phone number, which does seem to belong to my mortgage co., and I found some info on the internet (government site) that modifications are being done under the program that he mentioned.I asked ""What could I expect if I do...""  14.2<30Seems pretty positive.What could I expect if I just forget about it? 39.1<63Not sure what to make of coming vs. going.

I asked what are my chances of being accepted into a said programme?I received 14.3>38.Looking at Wilhelm's interpretation of the hexagram,Nine in the third place means:A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.A petty man cannot do this.A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses as his exclusive personal property , but should place it at the disposal of the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right attitude toward his possession, which as private property can never endure. A petty man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great possessions, because instead of sacrificing them, he would keep them for himself.I am not sure what the possessions are referring to.. how does possession of exclusive property relate to a chance of acceptance?Hex 38 : Fortune in small matters:bows:thank you if you can help."

Shortly, the dream was about me wanting to accompany her to her grave that was somewhere beneth a beautifully green hill - the dream was very colouful - and there was this fence with a door. she entered this door, but when I wanted to enter this beautiful dark horse appeared, almost crushing me if i had not closed the door on time. The question was what was this dream telling me?I ching answered hex 11, changing line 3 to hex 29.

2339,"Hello all,Today I wrote a short story for the first time. I write ideas etc in notebooks, but never have I written an actual story. I'm pleased that I've done it - not sure it's that great but I felt I was truly expressing myself with it, which is what it's all about... Anyway, I suppose this exercise, along with toying with the idea of imagining writing a novel (which seems like such a feat the more I think about it ) has made me wonder what it takes.I am fully aware that I may not have the qualities needed - especially the stamina, vision and commitment - for writing a longer story, but I asked:What qualities would need improving to be a novelist?52.2 > 18Seems a rather sorry line.But is it saying that by going too quickly and getting carried away, without pausing to see the bigger picture of what you're writing could alienate the reader? ('He is swpt along'/'He cannot rescue him whom he follows')? Or that if you don't pour your whole self into the movement of writing you will trip and fall? Every part of you has to be involved in the motion?But then, who or what could be the element (or 'master stronger than himself') that is sweeping me along? Perhaps it's just saying that I'm following in the footsteps of giants at the mo, ie real authors.I did find that while I enjoyed writing the story, I felt I didn't have the energy to take it further, or the confidence perhaps, or vision.. Hmm..What do you think the quality is?Full dedication? This is probably what needs working on (hex 18)Thanks :bows:Actually, now that I've engaged with the reading further through this post, the title of the post does not really apply.

2340,"I'm feeling a little confused with the various translations of line 4 of hex 51.I need to make changes in my working life and realised that I need to change my thinking about it before this can happen.

And I want to move on too. 51 has always seemed a positive hexagram to me, and the relating hexagram - 24 'The Turning point' seems quite clear. I do feel as though I'm at a turning point. But, line four of 51? Wilhelm saysChange in the fourth place means:Shock is mired.Whereas Hilary's translation saysShock releases a bogAs I'm seeing this, one translation (Wilhelm) says that the shock is 'bogged down' and the other (Hilary) says that the shock is 'releasing' the bog. In the light of my question, I'd much rather use Hilary's translation but that might not be what the Yi is saying.  Either I'm being told 'You're at a turning point but you're bogging yourself down', or 'You're at a turning point and getting out of a bog'.Can anyone throw light on this please?Thank you very much!:bows:"
2341,"Well last night I was turning my compost (it's in a bin) and I saw a garden snake in it. I freaked out of course and ran in the house. I looked it up on the web and it is a garden snake not harmful to humans and it eats rodents (a good thing imho).A few people had stories about snakes in their compost ranging from letting them be (and avoiding the compost for the time being )or getting rid of them with hot peppers and soap. I don't know how I am going to go near the compost bin again, especially don't know how I am going to turn it again. Apparently snakes like a warm place in July to have their multiple offspring.After calming down last night and thinking this snake has a right to exist and performs a certain function (some say they actually aerate the compost for you) but being very squeamish about it I asked the i ching :Should I do anything about the snake in the compost.30.5-13Wilhelm in 30 mentions ""Human life on earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.""""The great man continues the work of nature in the human world. ""This seems to say that the snake has it's place in the scheme of things in my garden and it is docile and I should also be docile towards it.The line 5 ""Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting."" That happened (probably to both of us)""if one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune will come from this grief. For here we are dealing not with a passing mood, as in the nine in the third place, but with a real change of heart.""Calm down and accept each other. The change of heart for me is to live with the snake nearby (knowing it's there, as opposed to being blissfully unaware.)13 FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.Success.I thought that was really funny. The snake was out in the open for sure.""all things that really belong together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a mere mingling of individuals or of things--that would be chaos, not fellowship. If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.""Seems like  the ic is telling me to leave it be and accept it's presence as a good thing.Also, there are good snakes and bad snakes, this is a good one.From Rosada in another thread:The IC reading seems to say that your heartfelt tears, 30.5, should lead to Friendship, 13Am I missing something here?I still feel like avoiding the compost and not stirring it for sure."
2342,"Apparently, I've upset my friend already.  It wasn't intentional!  I have questions and things I do not understand...and it's my nature then to ask about these things.  I'm pretty straightforward, but always try to be respectful and considerate of others' feelings...So, in my burning curiousity regarding a few things during my visit with my friend that I could not understand, I attempted to delicately address the questions.  He took offense and in no uncertain terms told me he was offended.  That's really too bad because I truly meant nothing offensive.  I'm trying to be understanding, but I actually don't really ""get"" how this was so offensive....  However, I did apologize (immediately!) for any offense I've caused, but haven't heard a word back from him sinceAsked the IC what's going on with this?  Response:  Hex 53.1.2.6 changing to 5.Is this just telling me to be  patient?  I think I am being patient...but maybe not?  Curiousity is difficult for me to be still with...Also asked IC how I can best handle this?  Response Hex 61.I would very much appreciate any insight into these two IC readings!!  Thank you!"
2343,"I have encountered this line twice in the past 10 days or so.  Had a few insights about its meaning that I wanted to share and would be interested in feed back.Starting with something from LiSe's ""Book of the Sun and Moon"":36.3 to 24Omen bird in the South. Hunting and catching the big head. Cannot make diseasedetermination. (No idea what this line might refer to.)I have the sense here that the ""omen bird"" is a moment of insight when one realizes the source of some problem.  As Wilhelm puts it:While the strong, loyal man is striving eagerly and in good faith to create order, he meets the ringleader of the disorder, as if by accident, and seizes him. Thus victory is achieved. But in abolishing abuses one must not be too hasty.  This would turn out badly because the abuses have been in existence so long.It is often the case that the euphoria and relief of finally discovering the cause of some suffering or disorder in life is followed by a long period of frustration and sometimes relapse.  This is because there is a significant difference between understanding a problem and fixing it.  The first is a gift, the second is a labor.Elsewhere in LiSe's translation (in hex 21), she writes:  Humanity has always used drugs, they make it easier to be a shaman, but unfortunately they usually forgot they had  also     teeth. Even the best shaman needs in the first place good teeth. How often it happens that some rarified spiritual state elevates us above the seeming chaos of a situation. At such a moment we might clearly see the path we should take.  All too often it happens that when we return to ""normal life"" we find that there were many more hills, trees and rough places that must be traversed then were apparent from that high vantage point.  A good physician might correctly diagnose a long standing disease in a moment but the period of convalescence can be long and arduous.  This is what I think this line is about.PeaceuTree"
2344,"Dear All,Who is portrayed in 37.1 - a child that has been disciplined or a strong person who bottles down their emotions and gets on, or perhaps, a child that has been disciplined and has now bottled down their emotions and got on? If this hexagram describes how one sees a certain person, does it portray strength or weakness?Many thanks for your insight!"
2345,"Hi, The question:Should I send him an e-mail and give him my msn address?The answer:First hexagram - 31Second hexagram - 31Since the hexagram did not change, does it mean I should continue doing what I've been doing so far and, therefore, not send him an e-mail to give him my msn address? If not, what exactly does it mean in relation to my question?Thank you for your help. "
2346,"Had a wonderful, wonderful visit with my friend!!  Really enjoyed myself, but left with some questions and ponderings....Asked IC how the visit was for him and received Hex 37.4.5. changing to 30.  Interesting response...curious as to how it applies to this situation?"
2347,"Hello everyone!Update on my continuing trouble relationship.  I write him online every day, and he writes back minimally, but enough to let me know he reads what I write.  I write everyday nonsense and from my heart.  I occasionally request from the Yi a status on our relationship.  Tonight I received the following:Status of relationship:  Hex 1 unchangingHis role:  Hex 1 unchangingMy role:  Hex 1 unchangingRecommendations:  28.5 > 32Note:  I am significantly older than he is - I've never been romantically involved with someone younger than me before.  But I'm absolutely devoted to him.I try to take what the Yi tells me dispassionately, so I don't go crazy and do something stupid.  So before I go crazy and do something stupid , I would very much appreciate the Clarity community's opinions.Thank you all for your time, empathy, and input,Dawn"
2348,"Currently my family is in the process of moving from a small town to a nearby city. This is a move that has been in the works (so to speak) for a couple of years. The family house has been on the market for about a month now. There is considerable uncertainty concerning the future (what's new?), however we all feel it's a good thing. I have only thrown coins once before (a few days ago) and I just went with Hillary's general explanation and experimented intuitively (by simply observing the hexagrams that emerged after certain questions). Today a family came up from the city and before me and my father left the house, I decided to do a quick toss, asking the question, ""Will this family make an offer?"". Now before I get ahead of myself, I'll just say they haven't made an offer yet and so that is probably unlikely. However, I tossed the coins six times and got my hexagram. Even without having consulted the I Ching, I could tell it was an interesting configuration. I drew the hexagram on some paper and left the house. My intuitive reaction to this hexagram was ""I bet they're gonna make an offer!"". My judgement may have been somewhat clouded. Me and father went to a nearby beach (nice lake). There are two picnic tables at this beach. Pointing to the right,  my father asked ""Should we go to that one"". I said we should go to the other (better view of the lake and mountains). So we sit down and I notice something in the middle of the table- a domino- the Six domino (six dots on one half, blank on the other). It seemed to me the Universe was communicating with me (one possibility), leaving me a little token (and I do like souvenirs). Though it is just an old plastic domino (looks like bone but it's not) with the number six on it (in dots) this is a powerful little gift in my eyes. I go home, realize I can look up hexagram definitions online, and discover that my hexagram from earlier is Hexagram 11 (T'ai) (three solid lines on the bottom and three broken on top). Now the situation concerning my family is obviously more complex than what I described in the beginning, but I was wondering what observations people might have concerning Hexagram 11, a Six Domino, and a family making changes that will greatly affect the lives of all those concerned (I'm only painting the picture the best I can). Currently the outlook is very good. The energy is very good. Your observations would be appreciated.PS I Heard audio recordings taken from the Voyager 1 and other NASA satellites today. Though I don't agree with shooting money into space, some of the these recordings are pretty sweet (especially from an experimental music perspective).Thanks, Julian"
2349,(pfffiewwhooo...4 changing lines..)in the mountains near were I live is some land with a pond. I would love to rent or buy it. So I ask the IC about the outcome realisation of this wish.
2350,"Hello again, I was hoping to get some clarity on Hex 1 as it confuses me a bit because it can be about creating and continuing, but can also be about divine forces in play, or even an overwhelming power, or even that it's a creation in my head......but the question is pretty straight forward i.e. a yes/no question, so I can't see why the IC would suggest the latter....I asked about X ""Is he going to approach me any time soon?"" and I got Hex 1 unchanging.I then asked ""What's on the cards for us these next couple of months?"" and got 17 unchanging which is also a confusing one for me I then asked ""Could you please clarify this further IC?"" and I got Hex 1 unchanging again! I often ask the IC to kindly clarify the reading after I've exhausted all avenues and can't come up with a clear interpretation i.e. especially when there isn't a lot available about that particular hex which I found was the case with 17.Any assistance in interpreting would be appreciated :bows: From what I've read Hex 1 is a great answer but I'll leave it to someone more experienced to interpret....thanksSofia "

Could you do the opposite of what hexagram one says to do, then, to bring about a different future outcome than the bad one represented by the second hexagram?Or is this like starting to dabble in the dark arts...

2356,"hello, this is my first time posting on this forum and wondering if anyone can give me perspective on this question. i guess it not a good idea to ask what might happen but i was hoping the Yi could remove some doubts. and i have already applied for the job, so i can't ask 'what if..' questions at this point. i've been very confused about my work recently. one job that i thought would be great  has left me feeling hollow and i sort of let it take over my life. as that contract is coming to an end i am trying to work out what to do next. i have applied for new job and for various reasons it fits the bill. however, i have not heard back from them in over 2 weeks after applying, so i think its likely i have not been shortlisted. today i asked Yi about this: will i be offered this job?  20.6>820 is contemplation, suggesting that my application is being contemplated? i have done my half by working hard on my application and now its up to them, so i can't take it to mean that i ought to contemplate it. but it sort of suggests that i have done half of my bit the 'ablution', but not the 'offering'. what can this mean? is it that they are the one's who have make the 'offering' and i am waiting for their response: 'Full of trust they look up to him' ? 9 at the top says 'contemplation of his life'. my working life is being contemplated, eg. someone is considering my CV? or that i am contemplating my own life (which i certainly am)...changing to 8, i read this is a positive outcome but only if upon reflection i think that i have the qualities to do the job well. should i read this a positive indication? or that i should think more about whether i can do it?"
2357,"Thinking about what to write about the intention and vision for this place (all the forums, including Shared Readings) I asked Yi to show me its highest potential.Yi says -4.5 to 59Love it! (And not least the way it echoes posts from Maria, Bamboo and Mike over in the 'Clarity News' threads.)You could read that as 'ignorance's dispersal', but I'm more inclined to think of Not Knowing as a purpose in itself. It reminds me of one of my personal favourite early readings, after I'd left academia, asking what my brains were for - and learning that they're for Not Knowing with.So the forums are for Not Knowing - a place to be ignorant, to ask questions and listen to the (first...) answer, and nurture de with the fruits of action. Ignorance's dispersing - the dispersing action and dispersing moment of ignorance. The power not knowing has to dissolve away solid things, divisions and artificial barriers. (Not to mention all Wilhelm has to say about egotism.) I imagine dispersing must make it much easier for the king to see his way to his temple.The moving line -‘Young ignoramus.Good fortune.’The good fortune is because she's young, right? So she has the capacity to learn something. So much more good fortune than being old and already knowing.Now please excuse me while I wander off around a line pathway...3.2, paired line, where this might be coming from/ what it might be responding to -‘Now sprouting, now hesitating.Now driving a full horse team.Not outlaws at all, marital allies.The child-woman’s constancy – not bearing children.Ten years go by, then bears children.’So the young fool's good fortune isn't so easy to come by. This little sprout hesitates, and sees outlaws where there are allies, but brings out his best horses and has great patience and faith that this will all bear fruit eventually, however long it takes. That makes 'young ignoramus, good fortune' sound like the moral of the story. Like the toddler who doesn't say, 'Oh dear, I fell over, it just goes to show I'm no good at this walking thing' and go back to crawling for the rest of his life.59.5, fan yao, how it might feel...'Dispersing sweat, his great proclamation.Dispersing the king's granaries.No mistake.'It might feel like hard work...  and like 'putting yourself out there', and certainly the perfect opposite of battling to hold onto status, uniqueness and authority. Staying within the security of the known and familiar would not (60.2) be good.So ...""The I Ching Community is a warm, open place for free, wide-ranging exploration of the I Ching. It's a place to learn about and from this oracle, through experience, one reading at a time. We respect the desire to learn, and honour the potential for growth in not knowing."""
2358,"Cheers,I am new to the Oracle..or should I say, the Oracle is new to me? There is so much information on the site about the hexagrams but reading the meaning behind each line seems like the easy part, the hard part is trying to understand and interpret it as it relates to my life or my questions.The Cauldron is an especially nice hexagram, the lines are almost loving and beautiful. But, I can't find the practical meaning in them!There is someone that wants to contact me. I mentioned him in my other post last week. When I asked the IC, ""what does he want to say to me?"" I got:50.1.3.6 Six at the beginning means:A Ting with legs upturned.Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.No blame.Nine in the third place means:The handle of the Ting is altered.One is impeded in his way of life.The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.Once rain falls, remorse is spent.Good fortune comes in the end.Nine at the top means:The Ting has rings of jade.Great good fortune.Nothing that would not act to further.I think I understand the first line - it seems to be saying that communcation stops the stagnation? But why the ""taking a cocubine for her son"" line?The second line seems to make sense too, I think. It seems to be saying that he wants to tell me that he is ""impeded""?I'm not sure. Line three I don't understand at all. Is it telling me what to do? How to respond? Or it is still answering my main question of ""what does he want to tell me?"".Isn't this hexagram mainly about resources? I'm a bit confused so any wisdom would  be helpful!cheers,Davina"

2361,"Looking for a bit of insight here, I'd appreciate anything anyone has to offer. I asked ""what did I do wrong here?"" in regards to a rather short-term relationship that has ended, but has left me utterly heartbroken. It was not my choice to end...the reasons being distance, too many responsibilities on both ends...and I'm not sure I agree, but I'm too close right now. I was looking for insight on my own actions/behaviors/attitudes, looking for a lesson to be learned. I really thought I was on the right track this time. The response was 53.6 > 39. On one post I read about a relationship that moves beyond sexual, another talks of reaching a high point that benefits others. Again, I'm too close to the situation to understand how that applies to me.Can someone point me in the right direction?I really despise the ache...I know each time I learn more about myself, but why does it have to hurt so much?"
2362,I'm devastated! I met my soulmate. We both agreed we were soulmates. He was perfect. He never did anything wrong. It was a new romance. My bitterness over something that he said and I misunderstood one day made me send him a text message to break it off making up a lame excuse. He was confused and shocked. He cleared up the misunderstanding. I've made many efforts to reconcile by sending him a long email telling him my fears and insecurities made me do it and why I was so bitter and that I regretted by actions and that misunderstandings happen in the beginning when two people don't know each other well.  He replied immediately thanking me for telling him how I felt and that he was sorry but he was not interested in continuing with me anymore and has ever since blocked every communication with me. I asked will he ever contact me again in the future and got:HEXAGRAM 6 line 5 changing into HEXAGRAM 64Please Willowfox I've been reading your predictions. You're amazing! Can you help me?:bag:

I've done fairly well not stressing out over anything, but presently everything is clouded with uncertainty.I put in a notice at my job because I was planning to move to my hometown for a few months to work on a book I've been planning to write. I was planning to stay at my grandmothers vacant condo, but recently my mother stayed there for a weekend and didn't behave too responsibly--at least in my grandmother's opinion. Now she's thought twice about letting me use it, stating that it needs to be in its present condition because she is selling it. I found that to be a touch insulting, but it was really revealing of where a pattern of rejection I've noticed for most of my life is rooted. I'm unsure if I'm suddenly compulsively asking the oracle for guidance or not--asking too many questions I don't feel too much pressure from any of this yet, but I'm beginning to run out of time since I could possibly have my job back if I acted quickly. Because of a cluster of synchronicity I felt that it was necessary to live in this particular town. I felt it was important for the book I'm writing and as well as reconciling my past/childhood and reconnecting w/ my family.I asked about the present uncertainty and received 28 w/ changing  line 3.About the book I want to write: 20 w/ changing lines 3 and 6.I asked again about my living situation: 21 w/ changing line 4.Then I asked for guidance on how to bite through: 51 w/ 3 and 4.Finally I asked what the rest of this year will be like: 23 w/ changing line 2.Perhaps I need to contemplate this all more, I don't feel that I'm drawing the right connections--even though the answers are all right in front of me.

One day , out of the blue, he broke up with me, said he just could not get to ""love""  He was crying and I was trying to comfort him. Sounds strange, but at the time it seemed natural.  Anyway, I let him go, no fights, no bad words, nothing..  For me... I missed him alot, the fun, I was not inlove with him,  I just enjoyed being with him.Fast forward to yesturday,  we saw each other in a crowd of people, without even thinking about it we both just ran to each other, and keeped hugging.  It was like no time passed between us. In the 15 minutes that I was talking to him... all he wanted to talk about was our breakup... to try and explain. This really confused meHe is married now... so no mentions  of getting together or anything like that.I just felt in odd.. that something bothered him for soooooooo long.My question was    Why did he feel a need to explain ?47 .3 4  ( cant remember what it went to. ) I have read and read,, and I cant see anything that would pretain to his.any insights ?Thank you"

Reflecting on this feeling of loneliness and being left to to myself, I first drew 51, shock.

I got 31.2,6 changing to 44. Is it telling me I shouldn't let myself be so swayed by those I love or am drawn to, and work on talking less? Or can it be taken less literally? I also don't see how 44 addresses my question of how to grow and develop as a person. Can anyone help me with this?just an update to those who were following the story: my partner never returned.

I'm having trouble getting a ""when"" out of this without my usual texts to guide me.So I asked another question hoping this translation could help me with that.9.1.3.6 >29Okay now I am lost.  Moving line 3 seems to completely contradict the main meaning of 9. I'll search around here for some insight, but please feel free to comment.Last edited: Jul 16, 2009"

2385,"Hi,I was recently given very, very nice item that I can sell for my own profit online. Because it was so kind for me to be given me this item to sell, I want to get the best price for it. I really don't want to blow this sale so I asked the Yi the following:""What do I need to know about selling this jacket?""Answer: 38.3.5 to 1Any input on what the Yi is telling me here? Thanks for helping!"
2386,"Edit - I posted a much clearer summary of my results in reply #10 once I learned which things I was supposed to read Hi, this is my first thread here so I'm not sure exactly what info I'm supposed to post, but I want to make sure I gave enough information to be complete so here we go.Situation:  A few weeks ago a very serious relationship ended, but I believe it ended over a misunderstanding.  Right now I'm giving my ex some space.  I'm wondering if I should contact her again (and if so, when), or just let go and move on.Here are the questions I asked and the results I got:What should I do regarding my situation with [name]?(note that I clicked ""consult the i ching"" once but I saw the hexagrams flicker so maybe it counted as a double click, but I had no way to go back and see what the first one was... so this might be the wrong hexagram)Primary Hexagram:24. Fu / Return (The Turning Point)--- ---  --- --- above K'un The Receptive, Earth --- ---  --- ---  --- --- below Chên The Arousing, Thunder -------  (the top two lines are red)The Judgement    Return. Success.    Going out and coming in without error.    Friends come without blame.    To and Fro goes the way.    On the seventh day comes return.    It furthers one to have somewhere to go.Relating Hexagram:42. I / Increase-------  ------- above Sun The Gentle, Wind --- ---  --- ---  --- --- below Chên The Arousing, Thunder-------  (all lines are black)The Judgement    Increase. It furthers one    To undertake something.    It furthers one to cross the great water.I guess I don't have to post the explanations of the individual lines cuz they can be looked up, right?  For the bottom line I found this explanation online: ""If a man misses the right time for return, he meets with misfortune.""  Does that mean that if I don't time this correctly I will mess up the chance to reunite with my ex?  If so, how do I determine the timing?So from that first one, should I interpret that as I should contact her again in a week (""on the seventh day comes return?"")I wasn't sure how to interpret the individual lines... Second question:How does [name] feel toward me?Primary Hexagram:5. Hsu / Waiting (Nourishment)--- ---  ------- above K'an The Abysmal, Water --- ---  -------  ------- below Ch'ien The Creative, Heaven -------  (the 2nd and 4th lines from the top are red, and the bottom line is red, as well)The Judgement    Waiting. If you are sincere,    You have light and success.    Perseverance brings good fortune.    It furthers one to cross the great water.Relating Hexagram:7. Shih / The Army--- ---  --- --- above K'un The Receptive, Earth --- ---  --- ---  ------- below K'an The Abysmal, Water --- ---  The Judgement    The Army. The army needs perseverance    And a strong man.    Good fortune without blame.I wasn't sure how to interpret this... is she ""waiting"" for me?Thanks!  I hope this isn't too long for a first post!Last edited: Jul 15, 2009"
2387,The iChing and a psychic told me clearly that someone would contact me. I meditated on the question: What will motivate him to contact me? and the answer was 58.6 Seductive Joyousness.What does that mean?
2388,"I am very worried about my oldest cat.  I know some people arent big on pets, but my cats are very important to me, especially this one.  Hes there when Im sick or sad and brings great comfort when Ive had a bad day.  He always knows and pays extra attention to me when I need it.  Right now, a friend is taking care of my cats while Im in Florida.  She goes every couple of days and feeds them plus spends some time with them.  She alerted me that my oldest was vomiting, especially when his ears were cleaned, and that he appeared thin.  She took him to the vet for me and they informed me that he is older than I thought.  I got him from a shelter and he was already partially grown, they had no info on him.  I thought he was between 8 and 10, but the vet says closer to 12.  They diagnosed an ear infection and also a severe heart murmur.  He was being treated with ear drops, but started losing his balance, so they said infection probably moved to inner ear and gave him an oral med.  My friend covered the expenses and Im mailing her a check.  They also recommended blood work, but it was too much for her to cover, so we were putting it off till Im home in two weeks, but she is very worried with his losing balance, so we decided today that Im going to get her the money right away and take him now.  As I am so worried being so far away and not going home for another two weeks, I asked Yi:What do I need to know about Vlad (Vladmir, named for Vlad Tempest, Rumanian ruler inspiration for Dracula): 17.6Not one of my favorite hexes, never sure what to follow.  Line 6 Having established a following, one attempts to retire but will be called back.   Sounds like a near death experience.  I admit it, I got nothing.  Any thoughts???What do I need to do about Vlad:  32.1.632 is endurance, duration, or I also have influence.  This usually symbolizes an enduring union.  Well that describes Vlad and me, but Im hoping its talking about his enduring the illness, that he will endure it and be ok.For the lines, in Wilhelms translation they seem to be saying similar things.  One talks of long continued work and reflection, while the other talks of not being in too much of a hurry.  In another translation they speak of deep commitment, but line 1 says no direction is advantageous, while line 6 talks of ones acts and presence being signs of commitment.  Legge has long continuance vs exciting to long continuance.  I think its saying have patience, that panicing is not going to help??  Maybe his treatment will take a while for him to improve??  Am I anywhere close?"

I have a lot of questions in my mind now and one of them was: What should I do about my relationship with him?I received hex.60.5 > 19. I read a few threads and the note by Hillary in the hexagram section (thank you Hillary  ). She wrote: In relationship readings, Hexagram 60 is still about setting ground rules: clarifying expectations, making sure you both mean the same thing by the same words, and simply that you understand one another. And once again, this is not optional: you can't assume the other person will just know these things if they're not put into words.So with hex.60 the IC is saying to me that you should address that with him and probably talk about future, my feelings, his, how he sees our relationship and so on. This would be a start and more work is to be done (hex.19). Is the IC telling me also to do that at my own pace? The IC is totally right by the way...we need to talk .  Is hex.19 good omen?I'd be happy to have your insights. I thank you very much,Mousse"

2401,"Last night I had perhaps the most disturbing dream I've had since the terrifying recurring nightmares I used to get as a child. In the dream, my mother and I were arguing fiercely. she got so mad that she slammed her middle toe in the kitchen cabinet, breaking it. The injury was so bad that her toe stood straight up from the instep. Then, the toe tranformed into the heel of a stiletto pump. I said something else to her, which I cannot now remember. And she replied, ""Well, I wanted to **** you, too!"" ...Then the dream ended. As with all numinous dreams, I do I Ching work to see if I can uncover hidden meanings. As I wrote about the dream, I did some free association on it. Some of the thoughts, images and emotions that sprang up were sexual desire, authority, fear, shame; an episode of ""Friends"" were Chandler lost his toe and Monica's mother exclaimed, ""Oh no! There's a toe somewhere in my kitchen!""; my foot fetish, jealousy, ""The queen's sway is ending"", incest, castration anxiety, penis.But the most enlightening image I associated with the dream was the <em>Oedipus Complex</em>. We all know Freud's Oedipus Complex theme. It runs throughout is writings in depth psychology. Though many think of it now as an antiquated, obsolete idea that has little or no merit, I disagree.According to Freud, a boy has hidden desires to kill his father and have sex with his mother. (This idea was popularized by the late rock artist, Jim Morrison, in his hit song ""Riders on the Storm""). Freud postulated the Oedipus complex because he felt the theory helped explain psychosexual development.I think my dream involves the Oedipus complex, with one eerie twist: The dream was not about <em>my</em> Oedipus Complex, but <em>my mother's.</em>In this sense, what I'm saying is that both mother and son have their own respective Oedipus complexes. Just as the son wants to kill the father and marry the mother, the mother wants to kill the ""man"" inside the boy - that is, the man who has individuated successfully and no longer sees his mother as the object of sexual deasire - and have sex with the ""boy."" This interplay of Oedipal complexes helps explain Freud's notion of ""castration anxiety"": the fear a man has of having his balls (an archetypal symbol of his strength, power, creativity, procreativity, and authority) cut off; he fears castration, not only because of his father's envy, but <em>also</em> because his unconscious knows the mother will try to emasculate him as he individuates, so as to retain him as the object of her sexual desire.hmm...OK. Let's back up a bit. Freud said that the boy's first object of sexual desire is his mother. OK. This makes sense. Not too hard to understand.But I think now - in light of this dream - that it is equally true that the mother's supreme, ultimate, deepest and most powerful object of sexual desire is her son. For example, we all know that suckling, while painful, is also an extremely pleasurable experience for a mother. The nipples, as we all know, are erotogeneous zones. In addition, most married couples say that after the child is born, the mother's level of sexual desire for her husband decreases. we all know that, if forced to make a choice between her child and her husband, a mother (at least a good mother) will always choose her child. And rightly so. These and other considerations lead me to believe that through the process of childrearing, the mother develops her own Oedipal complex alongside the child's. (Not to sound sexist, but I do believe that this complex is stronger between a mother and a son than it is between a mother and a daughter.) If true, it would easily explain why mothers tend to be so aloof and cold to the girlfriends their ""little men"" bring home. (This was true in my case, as my mother never liked <em>any</em> of the girls I introduced her to!).I think that my dream has something very much to do with this ""reverse Oedipal complex"". So, I did some I Ching work on it. The hexagram I got was #47 Adversity, with a change in line 2, resulting in #45 Assembling. Although I'm not altogether certain I know what line 2 represents, I will say that I have received #45 as much if not more than any other hexagram. And it's always perplexed me. I'm fairly sure it has something to do with my family, particularly my mother. However, my spiritual advisor strongle believes #45, in my case at least, has to do with an ""assembling"" of my true Self: i.e., Jungian individuation. Any answers out there?Any comments or interpretations on how these two hexagrams play into my dream and the Oedipus complex would be greatly appreciated.<em></em>"

2403,"Hello everyone,I seem to be in a time of 40 with a lot of different things beginning to shift in my life. I feel excited by the changes and to some degree am experiencing the opposite of a spiritual crisis, but still I find it hard to push doubt and fear completely over the cliff. 90% of me believes the changes coming my way are good ones, if not Heaven blessed; 10% of me thinks that that 90% is full of poo.Today I asked, because this is how it feels, ""What is being spooned onto my plate?""The answer: 1 Unchanging.Later I asked, because I wanted more info, ""Where is 1 (Hex 1/ The One) leading?""The answer: 29.4>47.I read the thread on 29.4, but as always there seem to be several takes. My immediate reaction led me to think of X, a man I love but am currently not in touch with. When I tried to think about what 29.4 meant, I saw this image of X handing me something through my window. I know, however, that emotions/wants have a funny way of messing with the mind, and so on second thought I came to the conclusion that the line meant I should ask God to help me prosper during this period of change without asking/telling God what changes to make. In relation to what I read in the thread, this would make sense because I would in essence be acting without attaching strings.What I need to know now is, What does someone smarter den me tink?"

2405,"Okay, there is a position in my organization which is opening up, and I would very much like to serve in this post, but it's complicated.  It might be politically bad for me to put my name in, because the current front runner is very competitive, and this person and I have been on poor terms in the past, and he slandered me.  It was nasty.  But that being said, applications are open.  So I asked for clarification:Hex 12.4  moving to 20. What I got out of that -- no kidding my potential running mate is a not nice person. He's not nice, and I know it.  I would probably get the position, because I am really qualified for it, and the people who make that decision are well disposed towards me, but I would definitely gain his enemity, and then he would do not nice things,a nd say not  nice things -- and it could be really stressful. So I think the oracle is suggesting I make myself ready and just wait.So then I asked, what if the current front runner gets the job?  What would happen in the organization?21.1.4.5 >20This was a lot harder to interpret. 21 -- It is possible that people in the group who like him less than me will use the groups bylaws to resist him taking the post. That is a real possibility, in fact it may be going on right now.21.1 He will be held back in small ways to try to keep him in check. 21.4  (Some interesting literalness about money and arrows...) Basically he would accomplish some valuable things, in order to prove that he was a worthy candidate.21.5  (This one really eludes me.)  He would push the group to achieve things so that he could brag about it, even if the cost of accomplishing the goal alienated people, or made the group ""dry"".  We have a lot of personal resources, and when we pull together we can accomplish great things. I just think he would harness that for his own selfish goals. Is that anything close?  This line is really hard.20 But still the counsel is wait.Okay thoughts?  If I am going to put my name in for consideration I have to do it over the weekend.Update, I asked if taking the post would make me happy I got44.2.3>12 -- I don't think it would.

2407,"Hi, I'm cleaning out a bunch of books and belongings--late spring cleaning--liberation from clutter!  I have a set of comic book reprints--a bound set of the entire run of this comic, with five separate slip cases.  The books were bought for research for a musical I wrote years ago, and I keep holding onto them, though I've lost the stage rights to the material--but the set was somewhat pricey.  I thought I should finally sell them, but something keeps holding me back--reluctant to let go I guess.  I doubt I'll ever return to this show, but if I did get rid of them, I could never reassemble all the comics if I wanted to rewrite or update.  They're not in quite collectible condition--some sun-bleaching of some of the spines, a little wear and tear, but mostly in good shape.  Because of my indecision, I asked ""what is the wisdom of selling the comic collection?""  I rolled 14 with 9 in the first and fourth places, turning to 18.  14 is Sovereignty, Possession in Great Measure, or Great Possessions (Karcher).  Well, the collection isn't THAT valuable, but obviously I assign it some value, sentimental or otherwise.  1st 9 says in effect ""there is nothing harmful in this idea"".  2nd 9 says ""Do not seek to be forceful or dominant"".  Well, I'm not--just wondering if in the future I would regret selling these (I'd rather have asked a yes or no question but apparently we should shun that path).  Then, 18 is Repair, Decay, or Corruption (Karcher).  ""Disorder, perversion or decay, with roots in the past.  Renew, renovate, find a new beginning"". (Karcher)I suppose I could interpret this EITHER way--sell them, keep them.  I can't really repair them, although I could clean them, but I think there's some reference to the musical itself and either the fact that I should try to repair or upgrade the musical, but that seems tangential to the actual question.  But maybe the actual question is, ""will I ever need these again?""Does anybody else with a dispassionate eye have an idea about this?Thanks!Chad"

I can't decide if this means to push through the obstruction and just go, or to wait for more favorable circumstances.  And I was puzzled about the resulting hexagram #18, Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay).  One of the reasons I want to take this trip is that I want to move to a different area of the country and I wanted to check this place out.  And I wanted to get my circulation going, so to speak.  I haven't been on a plane for 10 years!  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

2410,"Hello,i'm new to these forums. I have been studying i-ching since last year thanks to the Jung's interpretation of it.I have always payed a great respect to i-ching and used it only with umility and for important matters. It NEVER failed...In these days i have a question that literally corrodes me regarding a very passionate affair i have got. I fear that it's flame is slowly whitering away. I did two i-ching readings,distanced by a couple of days.The first reading gave me a 51 turning to 8. The second one, which was done yesterday, gave me a 47 turning to 51. In this last reading my question was if i interpreted the first reading correctly,if i am doing right and how that's is gonna turn out.I am very impressed,nearly frigthened,about the clarity and coherency of these two readings.The last one in particular struck me very deeply.I have read them as a ""take your time, explore your inner questions and solve them. Rushing would only destroy all the good work done before"".What do you guys think about it? Thanks a lot.If you need more detailed info,feel free to ask.Goodbye."

However, we live fairly far from one another so this is being done via email, phone, and texts.  This is not something I've experienced before as a method of getting to know someone.  I am also visiting him in a few weeks...and I'm very excited, but also rather nervous, as again this is very new for me to experience!!As we're getting to know more about each other, I'm very curious about the relationship...I asked the IC what he thinks/feels for me at this time in our getting-to-know-you (via technology)...IC responded Hex 24.2.4 changing to 54.Hex 54 never feels very good to me regarding relationship (potential) questions.  It seems to be a very limited/limiting relationship from the female's perspective...and I'm certainly not aspiring or desiring to be anyone's concubine, no matter how appealing or intriguing he might beAre there any other perspectives on this hex relationship-wise...other than the seemingly obvious?  I do realize the challenge of asking IC about another's feelings/thoughts and I typipcally shy away from those questions.  However, I am interested, but have no desire to question this man at this early point...would never want to seem pushy or as though I'm attempting to jump into something huge.. However, I do question how realistic the possibility of this becoming anything is  and also how far I want to reveal myself in the interest of not exposing myself to more vulnerability than I might be prepared to handle...  i.e.: I haven't seriously contemplated a romantic relationship in years and I'm out of my element, as well as have a vested interest in protecting myself and staying rational, in spite of the excitement of the open possibilities...So...any insight into this reading would be welcome and appreciated.

2414,"Yup, just when you thought you'd heard it all.For some reason I find myself grieving about MJ's death. Granted, I did grow up with his music, but never would anyone describe me as an active ""fan."" I never saw him in concert.Since the day he died, I find myself in tears whenever the story or his music show up on radio or TV. I have stress in my life now, not negative in nature, but still it's stress. So I assume my upset has been caused by the real day to day things and ultimately has had nothing at all to do with Michael Jackson's death.Tonight I asked, Why am I so upset about MJ's death?24.3.5>63I cannot get beyond the literal: He's gone back ""home"" and will never return.That in itself is sad to me (what can I say, I'm a hardcore romantic), but b/c I cannot stop until I get enuff, I decided to step over the edge and ask, ""Was there a spiritual connection between me and MJ?""19.3.4.5.6>1What a question. I cannot even begin to guess..."

2416,"Hello,Don't know if when it comes to writing - there's either a novelist in you or not, but still.. I'm trying to write stories but as I write I'm always conscious of the barriers in my imagination, and the world, as a narrator, that I am not describing.Stories are good when you can relate to what is written (not too insular) and when the world described is interesting and draws you in...I asked:How do I create a world in writing? 44.2,3,6 > 45Does this mean I need to be more aware of how my ideas, thoughts (monlogues) might affect others? Or is it about gathering together creative ideas?What could be the warning here? (as 44 does seem to have one.. although there is fish in the tank!...)Perhaps it's about not attacking it too forcefully - rather gathering ideas first? A rough outline e.g. for a plot or characters?? Before attempting?Thanks,Advice would be much appreciated as always.:bows:"
2417,"I had a question a while back about something I was considering sharing with others. My question was: ""Should I mention X to others?""The response was: 31.1.2.3.4 to 60At first I interpreted this as a NOBut,If i'm to interpret any of this Yijing correctly it's ever giving advice on method rather than black and white yes or no. Also reading other people's description of 31 describes more than just courtship:HSIEN : come into contact with, influence; reach, join together; put together; put together as parts of a previously seperated whole; come into conjunction, as the celestial bodies; totally, completely; lit: broken pieces of pottery, the halfs of which join to identify partners."" ERANOS p362Then these four lines: seem to describe much better what i've been going through in deciding to speak of this with others:Line 1""Influencing one's big toe. [In humans, the intention to move is betrayed by the movement of one piece of anatomy before anything else - the big toe of one's dominant foot. To begin anything we start with the big toe.]""Line 2""Influencing one's calves. Danger. Sit. [Apparent strength hides inner weakness (weak foundations), if you 'stand' now you will fall].""Line 3""Influencing one's thighs, Keeping to one's course. A regrettable move. [The power of the thighs pushes us up, ready to 'say our piece'. In this situation though, a certain level of deference is required.]""Line 4""Although in testing times, one's problems will be gone. A level of Indecisiveness (hesitation, coming and going) suggests one should consider joining with others. [Hesitation and coming and going can be associated with erratic breathing; influencing the middrift.]""I think i'm at stage four if one was to take this as a chronological order of events. Which would be a pretty rigid interpretation. Then I remembered how 60 was translated as articulating. Well I'm leaning towards that now already as I'm at least getting help on the divination.Any assistance in interpretation would be most appreciated.:bows:"

2419,"I am right now 58 years old. I just love to work. I’ve been a Bi-lingual Executive Secretary all my life but, I got tired of doing that and tried being an English Teacher so I studied to be one. I got my diploma, besides, after living and working as a Bookkeeper in a strong company in the USA for seven years my English got better. I came back to my country and settled down in a nice port. My daughter and I are most of the time together so while we were studying to get our English Teacher’s Diploma She was offered a job in a Bi-lingual school. She asked me to drive her to that place to have an interview with the owner/principal so I did. When the owner of the school came, she saw me there and asked me to work for them. I told her that my goal was to teach English to adults and not Math and History to primary/high school kids but she insisted a lot so I stayed (not very happy). I was not ready to do that so it wasn’t successful and as I have experience in Informatics they asked me to teach the students. I got 12 groups under my responsibility. Now at the end of the School year they are asking me ( I hate to say this but almost begging me) to work for them in the administrative section. The owners of the school are two sisters. It’s crystal clear that they don’t have much experience in that area. They are also very demanding and they mount on rage when they get overwhelmed for the work and the problems attained to the school’s issues, ups and downs, etc. They are even humiliating and nasty with their employees. Fortunately I never experienced any of this with them but there is always a chance to face with that negative side of them.I told them no (to their last offer) not because I am not capable but because I am tired of doing the same all my life. They are still waiting for an answer. They asked me to stop saying no and wait for August (The starting of the school year) to tell them if I accept or not. I have many opportunities as an English Teacher, I mean teaching English privately to any person in this world willing to learn it. I can work with for my ""alma mater""  I have also a proposition to be a partner in founding a school. I have even plans to start my own business. There are many good things around but, I don’t want to make a mistake by making the wrong choice. I asked Yi •Where my current situation is leading to? I got hex. 31 no changing lines. •Is this change for the better?  Hex. 56, lines 4 and 5•What will happen if I accept the new job position they are offering to me at   XX?Did I make the right questions? Please help!"
2420,"It is really amazing to come across you guys. The I Ching has been a rather solitary occupation for me up to now. I have been reading and trying to fathom it since 1975. Actually I don't consult it very often now because I have binged on it in the past using it as a crutch (addictive personality) and I figure I should be able to work things out for myself. I have been reading parts of this great site over the past few days since I signed up and it is so interesting to see other people using it, a novelty for me. It gives great perspective. I did consult this week for a big decision (buying a flat at auction) and received H14 L2,4,5,6. I was therfore grateful to read all about how to deal with multiple moving lines. Anyway, my divination seems very auspicious  but is there anything I might have missed?"

2422,"Really need help and insight on this one...  REALLY concerned and confused...I'm having some strong concerns and worries regarding my ex-husband.  The concerns involve our two children.  In  a nutshell:  we live in Michigan, USA.  My ex-husb moved last year across the country to Nevada.  His intention was we would join him soon after he moved there (June 08).  He changed his mind at the last minute.  I was frustrated at the inconvenience of the last minute sudden cdhange, but deeply relieved as well, as were my (our) children...who miss their dad but do not wish to be uprooted so drastically from all they've ever known.Fast forward to present:  He is now feeling more settled out there and has begun really pushing the subject of us moving out there again.  My children are truly conflicted as they have lives, friends, school activities etc, here, but they very much miss their father as well (he's always been a wonderful, devoted father to them!)There were obviously reasons for he and I divorcing  ten years ago.  It was truly a frightening time for me and he was not the kind of person (at that time) who could be  trusted or a good influence for his children.  However, he has worked on himself to become a great father and has proven himself as very good to them and even me as well.  I'm grateful for him as my children's father.However, moving across the country far from all I've ever known to a huge city that has an entirely different feel and culture than what my children and I are used to is frightening!!!!!!  Especially when I remember the reasons behind me leaving him so many years ago and the incidents surrounding that horrible timeAlthough he  is still very financially supportive to us, his behavior since moving out there has become mildly concerning to me...nothing truly horrible, just those little weird kinda gut feelings now and then that something isn't quite right.I'm afraid.  I'm afraid to move out there with my children.  I have concerns about his overall motivations, concerns about what this means for *my* life, concerns about putting myself in a situation where I (we) will be basically dependent on him completely, away from any friends and/or family to ever help should we need it.  I'm also having some fears about his ultimate motives...and the thoughts that once out  there, he legally (and financially) has more power than I to keep our children there, if he decided to do so...whether or not we actually want to stay there.I hope this pot makes some sense...  Asked IC what are the motivations of my ex-husband regarding moving us out to Nevada.  Response:  hexagram 6.2.3.6 changing to 31.Any insight, thoughts, or suggestions regarding this would be so very much appreciated, as I'm truly torn about this..afraid to ignore my little worries, but afraid to give into them as well (just a bit of past-related paranoia, perhaps?)..Thank you all so much!  ~Namaste~:bows:Added:  Asked IC for insight re:  my dughters and I moving to Nevada.

2424,"I haven't posted in a very very long time, but I have been a silent reader of this website, and try to learn as much as possible. I find myself here again because I need some help...I am 8 months pregnant, and I am suddenly without my partner, the baby's father. I found him one day last week in a prescription drug stupor...I dropped him off at the hospital, he spent the week detoxing, and now he is a drug rehab for at least 28 days. I don't know which end is up, I don't know if I want him in my life, but perhaps I'm willing to give the chance if he can do the work, get things together. I am aware that the odds are against this. I really had no idea he was struggling so much, or that he had a drug problem. Yes, I am very very angry...Anyway, I asked what X will make of this coming month in rehab. 59.6 - 29.Is this a message to me to cut my losses and run? Or is it just a description of what's going on right now? Or could it be about him - that he can ""disperse"" with the maladaptive behavior and become whole again?Any input is very welcome - I am firmly grounded in reality right now!As an afterthought - I asked ""What do I do about X and me?"" 22.2 - 26.

Or move on?If there is something, is it a positive changing view?10.2,3,6 > 49Well definitely alludes to change. But I think it's saying I've had to tread too carefully for too long and now it's time to revolutionize.... Cast off the shackles despite how important they have been, one way or another, but never perfect...Overall are these readings conducive to a positive change between two people or is this just about what I need to do?I read somewhere that 23 can symbolize a situation where only one is supporting something that requires two - so it breaks...Thanks for your help.

2426,"Sorry to bring up another relationship problem but I'm stumped ...I returned to I Ching after a number of years away (runes, tarot, astrology) when a friend reminded me of the focus and strength of the direction inherent.I've been looking for something to ""do"" about a rapidly deteriorating personal relationship (one that I know is quite precious to us both). Been taking a daily casting for focus of the day - return?/ending?/transforming? where the other person is very closed to me, but won't actually go away, nor will accept my departure (hence the daily castings looking for a right time or right approach to heal this ...... whatever-it-is-now).Usually, it's something I can follow or understand readily (even the moving lines), but today -- not so much.Today I got #8 (Pi / Holding Together; single moving line = 6 in fourth place) which, imhe, changes to #45 (Ts'ui / Gathering Together). Both are K'un on the bottom and both are water on top, in different degrees (essenses?) -- I have a feel for where the direction lays, but I'm stuck on this:Based on my query (""What do I do about (B) now?""), who is the ""man of strong will"" / ""central figure around whom other persons may unite"" (Wilhelm/Baynes). Is that him (definitely the centre of his own dramas - this one included)? Or me, since I'm the one that seems to be more in control of the situation (albeit from a passive position) and able to see & make change that would bring the union into place?Is there finally something I can do or am I to wait for him to do? If either, is there a time frame? Can you tell I've become impatient with this situation?  <lol!>Or <sigh> have I got it entirely wrong (also something not unfamiliar!)?  Thank you for any insights you have -- I'm enjoying reading the forum and learning from your posts & replies.Ajriel   :bows:"
2427,"A close relative of mine is homebound with what a doctor diagnosed as colic. However, we think it may be something more serious, since she is an older person. We were worried because she did not eat for a few days, only taking vitamins and liquids.I asked the oracle, and the lines mimic the person staying at home and not going out at all.60.3 states it seems her illness is of her own making?Hex. 48 incidentally states about a well, which brings up a symbolism of the waste system of the body. We suspect it is an intestinal ailment. But I dont understand what it means by the jug breaks?The hexagram seems to rule out more serious ailments like cancer? So it probably is a minor infection of the waste system. What do you suggest?thank you."
2428,"Hi all,I am scatty and getting increasingly worse it seems - sometimes to the point of senility! I guess it comes in part from not being able to fully live in the moment - maybe because invariably, my person is in the moment - won't budge in fact! (lol) and so I doubt it...My mind projects itself away from me - into the future, with worries to boot. Could also be because I'm not enjoying the job I have at the moment, at all, and am very much up and down at home. As a result I make mistakes - which then causes further stress (I have read that excess cortisol (from stressful experiences) can make for scatty people and inhibits connecting neurons in the brain...) I think this also lends to a selfish mode of existence in a way, because I am unable to perform well for others - maybe because I'm too aware of myself and all that, or because I'm just not interested in what I'm doing.I asked Why am I so scatty? 64.3 > 50I wasn't sure what to make of this until I read this by Bradford: 'Don't get impatient. Be as practical as you can. Keep the goals in view. Watch out for anything leading to short-sightedness. Think your statements through.'I do rush about trying to do things but fail to concentrate. I suppose I'm always to eager for the moments to pass these days... Do the two hexagrams suggest I need to turn down the temperature - that I am ineffectively pressure cooking my brain? Jumping ahead of myself? How does this reading suggest I can improve my mental faculties??I also asked how do I better deal with my stress?(which has been getting harder and harder to manage)26.2 > 22I think I'm pretty clear on this - I need to stop letting things de-rail me... and occupy my mind on nice things (go shopping, have a massage, etc - utilize the simple pleasures of life (hex 22) before I fall off the wagon completely...I'd be really grateful for any help and advice here.Thanks :bows:"

It has had a drastic effect on my working situation and it's only been in the last fortnight that I've been feeling better.

You are workingon putting things right but (line 4)  you're too comfortable where you are and if you go on like this then you'll really be in trouble. (Although where I am feels extremely uncomfortable!) Hex 50 - put all your talents and efforts together and make something of yourself.Then I asked: What do I have to DO to get back to work and earning quickly (bearing in mind I'm no spring chicken and there's a recession on)Answer 30.2.6 > 34My interpretation: get very clear on what you want, get your priorities sorted out and market yourself. Carry on sorting out your problems but let your light shine brightly. Hex 34 seems to be saying (in this context) do it very purposefully.I'd be so grateful if anyone here could give me a steer on whether I've got this right.With thanksAnn"

I am not completely comfortable, well I am not comfortable at all, for various reasons with this relationshipMy question was:What can I expect from this relationship?31.3.5.6>35I am not sure if this is saying that will be glorious and not to worry.Or if this relationship is inevitable and will burn bright and then flame out.I am kind of putting my money on the second one. One translation I looked at said ""the cycle is ending"" I am not sure what that means. And even though it is pertaining to my daughter some of it seems directed at me (line 5 and 6 lol) but I have shut my mouth  because I care about our relationship. Needless to say this seems like a positive Hex and that's okay too but I am unsure of my take on it.  33.5.6>62I also askedWhat can my grandson expect from this relationship.But again this also seemed to apply more to me than him (He is 10). He is not particularly happy with the situation but it is not because the man is mean...he is not as far as I know and my daughter wouldn't allow it. In act it is more the opposite it is only that my grandson has some trust issues right now.Does the Yi sometimes point things back at you rather than at the person your asking ""for""? As they aren't asking I wondered if this could be so.  If not how in hell do you tell a 10 yr old to 'be small' and you will win. If that is what the Yi is saying.I could use some help with this one if you all are willing to put in your 2 cents worth."

Found out that a visit to him is possible(   ), but still concerned about the should I's and what the actual energies and possibilities are surrounding this man and I.  Concerned about making something out of nothing or seeing romance where maybe there is only a friendship.  I'd visit either way, as I enjoy him and think his friendship alone would be gift enough,  but I admit, that I think my feelings regarding this are not merely about friendship.  I'm not at all sure just where his feelings and thoughts about me lie in the spectrum either.  He's very attentive to me communication wise, but other than some light and mild fun flirtations, he seems to be staying in the safely friends zone...Not comfortable asking him directly because it does seem a bit early to put that kind of pressure on the situation/relationship.  Taking things light and slow and just paying lots of attention to him and trying to see which way he seems to be leaning...not really feeling certain of his direction though... And trying to decide if a visit is a good idea or not....Asked IC for additional insight regarding him.  Received hex 8.  Is this mostly a positive hex for friendship or/and group things?Asked for more insight into this response (as hex 8 encourages).  Received hex 25.1.3.6 changing to 31.Seems hex 25 is about natural misfortunes/disasters?  Looked into the lines and line 3 indicates something about someone having an advantage of someone else's loss! (He has gone through a rough divorce over the past few years I know...and I've had a really difficult and traumatic split from my ex over the past 3 years...) not sure who this is referring to as taking advantage of the other?    I've certainly no wish  to take advantage of his pain over his divorce!!   Nor to have my pain and loss expounded upon in any way!!!   And line 6 says to not act on feelings....

This describes the situation exactly as I see it from my part... as I was expecting to meet with this person for a long time and when finally I could, external factors made our meeting get delayed for another week. The oracle is telling me that even when this is happening, at the end it will be for better.What's your view on the first answer?Thank you!SamLast edited: Sep 29, 2008"
2439,"So, today my car wouldn't start and I had to get it towed. It's a very old car, but I've put a bit of money into it and have been told it should last a while longer. Of course, since I had to deal with getting it towed and borrowing a car, I lost part of my day. I had planned to run errands, exercise, and write...most of which I'm still doing or planning to do, just a little later than expected. When I sat down with the Yi, I got a number of answers that didn't seem to fit my car problems, so I'm thinking maybe I'm being told to let it go and try to focus on my writing. On the other hand, I have a hard time assuming it's ok to do that...I asked specific questions, got specific answers, and just don't know how to relate them.My first question was broad, What do you want to tell me today? Answer was 55, which made me think maybe the car problem is not something I should worry about? (Difficult, since I'm not ready financially to buy a new one.)Second I asked, What do you mean by 55? 24.5>3 was the answer. I get 24.5 quite often lately, and I know it's a positive line, but am not sure how it applies. Next I asked how my car is and I got 43 unchanging, which I find impossible to understand. I did see the word ""eliminate"" in one definition of this hexagram, which, um, scared me a tad...Lastly I asked if anything was around the bend for tomorrow or Tuesday, since I thought I might get an answer that had to do with the car. I got 30.2>14.I always seem to get 14 in reference to writing-related questions, so all tolled with 55, 24.5, 30.2 and 14, I thought the Yi was trying to redirect my attention to what I have and what's most important. But 43 throws me, and the truth is, I am up @#$# creek without my ride, so it is important.Things that make you go hmmmmmmmm...Any ideas much appreciated."
2440,"I have done an awful thing.I feel supreme guilt but don't know how to make things better.Since moving home I have been very up and down. Maybe unfortunately, someone suggested I read a book called 'Why Love Matters' about insecure adults and their childhoods etc etc.As a result, masochistically even, I have goaded the situation towards a painful blow - I have made suggestions to my mum about why things may have gone wrong - and as a result hurt her. We usually get on well but the pressure of living together... in her life she suffered with the same issues - lonliness, inability to maintain friendships, low self-esteem, but hopeless idealism - that I feel now.. So I have regressed to a teen horror it feels like - but the typical pattern is that we'll row- I'll cower, feel guilty, say sorry - whereas she'll just stomp off - happily go to bed on an argument. This is all my fault. I had a dark feeling this might happen, but I've been careful to reassure her that I don't hate/ blame her for everything - but maybe, who am I kidding? - I feel like by moving home, I have crushed someone who had finally found peace with herself. I feel disgusted with myself.I asked for commentary36.3 > 24She had a difficult childhood too - mother sent her away to boarding school etc - and if she didn't get good mothering, then how was she to learn (as said in the book) Gets passed down from generation to generation - but now I have brought her down with my negativity weakly disguised with bouts from me of 'I know I should stop feeling sorry for myself' (47.1 - things aren't that bad compared to many!)But that doesn't stop the pleasure, humour, and happiness of daily life from being zapped by the pain I feel inside.If anyone can suggest what I can do to repair the damage.... to be able to let it out on this is helpful - but I think I shouldn't have read the book with I suppose churned the grievances I hold against my parents.But I feel disgusted with my weakness - despite all the wisdom.I wish I'd kept my mouth shut, and perhaps not allowed myself to move home and ruin our good, even great relationship that was a few months ago.This has been building a while and came to a head this evening - with my mum dwelling on her own failures in the past and my hurtfully saying I didn't want to suffer in the same way - but fear I already am.:bows:"
2441,"My best friend and I have been having some difficulty for a while now.  Tonight it kind of exploded and I dont know what to do.  I posted the questions I asked and my working through them; there is also background at the end if needed.  So what do I do about my friend?  59.3Oy!  Ok, vital energy thats damned up, his or mine or the friendship as a whole?  dissolving devisive egotism, thats gotta be me.  Interesting it talks of religious forces as thats what we're arguing about.  He is one of the people whose destiny I see, and this is so not it.  Setting a high goal for the will of the people, thats what Im trying to do, is that saying that that is what needs dispersing or what will bring us together?  Ok, the image has all kinds of relations to us, but Im not sure who its speaking of.  Im not comfortable discussing too much of what I see, but part of it, especially with him, is about a spiritual awakening, so that last line in Wilhelm could be talking about him or could be telling me I need to be more open to his current path.  then the line 3:  Whose work are we talking about here?  Im focusing on Wilhelm for now, will look at other later and hope you guys can add some as well.  Disperse what the self gathers as a barrier against others, again him or me?  Do i disperse my reaction to all this or does he disperse this path because it sets up barriers for him with others, which it definately does.  Some of his ""friends"" will no longer talk to him (put friends in quotes because I dont that is being a good friend), and others shy away because he comes off like a whackjob.  A great renunciation, him or me???  This is why I have such difficult, I understand the meaning, just not always who or what it refers to.Ok, then asked, where do we go from here?  22.4I got 22 for something else not long ago and read through the memorizing thread of Rosadas.  I know her purpose was to help people memorize, but I also find it helpful when I need some insight.  They put forth the idea that this line might be about someone who was shady or slick, but I dont think so in this case.  I dont get the hex at all, nothing about this is shallow or surface stuff that I can see, but Im hoping the true friend who courts him is me.  Oh wait, I commented recently that I felt like this belief was a mask he was wearing, one he was afraid I would remove to see the truth beneath.  I have felt all along that something happened to cause this, that he is somehow hiding or escaping from something.  Could it mean the belief itself is superficial or surface beauty, or something like that?  Or am I just seeing what I want?  Transcending the limits of space and time, again, relates to things we have discussed on our joint path.  What does the future hold for our friendship? 21Yick!  Couldnt just be 11 could it?  Ok, my feeling is will be difficult, working through things like biting through leather, but not necessarily at an end.  Im sure there is more advice here, but Im at a loss.  I did look at the image as I was reminded to do recently on a single hex but I got nothing.   Background if you need it:He and I were have always been on the same path, shared the same beliefs and views of the universe.  Then, without warning, he suddenly did a complete 180.  He joined some local nondenominational church and stopped talking to me other than occasional short emails.  He didnt even tell me about the church thing, another friend did.  Understand, though it is not my thing, I do not normally have a problem with people going to church.  But this was so out of the blue, and that he didnt even talk to me about it.  Add to that that I did a little investigating and its one of those, Ill say fringe to be nice, churches, and the people who run it are somewhat shady.  I am not the only one of his friends who has been worried, especially since he refuses to discuss what caused the change, but as the closest to him, I was the one who has been trying to work on him.  He has always been extremely logical and is highly intelligent, wellread, and wellspoken.  It is rare that he loses an argument because he is so good at making his point, and he has always enjoyed a good debate.  I decided to approach it from that standpoint, so I posted a thread on his facebook that started a discourse on one of his new beliefs.  I researched for support for the point I was making, both biblical and other sources, and he just kept coming back with the same rhetoric.  I continued to point out the fallacy in his arguments and give concrete support for mine.  All of a sudden he posted he saw no merit in the discussion and removed it entirely.  I then received a text from a mutual friend that they had talked and he had said he no longer wished to be part of our group and had no desire to see me in person, even if it was to tell me to go away.  Our group was supposed to be getting together tomorrow, and I have not seen him since last summer.  I was stunned.  This is the same person who last summer told me that he wanted me to be happy but he liked being the most important man in my life and did not want to be replaced (conversation about my dating).  We dont have that kind of relationship, he is much younger, and I dont know, its a spiritual connection, its just purer than that.  I cant explain it, but its like we're two halves of the same whole.  I formed by view of love from the movie What Dreams May Come, and I have always said about him, that there are a handful of people I would follow into hell to save, but he is the only one for whom I would stay.  I think he is being illogical and pigheaded, but its my fault too.  I get carried away when Im defending a position on an issue.  Im reminded of the scene in the movie Nuts where Lavinsky is crossexamining the father and he keeps pushing until everything comes out, but then Claudia goes almost hysterical.  Later in the hospital he tells her, ""Im sorry, I got so caught up in being a gd lawyer.""  I know Im prone to that, but he has always been like that too.  We have always taken it to the bitter end, but its always been in fun, with little jabs at each other like lets see what you got little girl, or c'mon pretty boy let's dance.  I never expected this reaction from him, and Im at a loss.  Oh, well I just got a text from our mutual friend that though he doesn want to talk to me now, when asked if he was ending the friendship he said he wasnt ready to do that, that he needed time to think.  I did post an apology, but Im still worried.  It isnt romantic or sexual, but in a very real way he is the love of my life.  Its everything I was looking for all those obsessive years, just didnt know it until I found it.  Anyway, would appreciate any further insight you may have to offer.  Btw, most other posts seem so short, do I give too much info???"
2442,"I posted before about my possibly losing my job, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel from a legal standpoint.  The tunnel went dark yesterday.  I received an email from the legal dept stating I have no case.  The details arent really important, my last stand effort failed and Im now out of a job.  So, of course, I turned to Yi for further insight.What do I do about my job now? 2.3.5.6I get being open and receptive, maybe to help and ideas from others, and certainly any opportunities that present themselves.  ""Hold to the goal and you will find direction.  Let all your experience be food for what is developing.""line 3  - ""success may not be immediate.  do not parade talent or beauty.  they will be seen in its season""line 5 - ""the inner quality is more important than external show.  from this quality will emerge success.line 6 - (this line scares the bejeezuz out of me) ""when there is conflict between the receptive and he dynamic there is a loss of power.  Do not be in conflict when there can arise a joining.""What I get is to stick to it, maybe a reference to teaching itself as some of my friends suggested looking for something else, but maybe to highlight my experience, but with line one not brag about it or overemphasize, could it mean no spin-doctoring?  the inner quality in line 5, maybe my sincere desire to teach, to influence and motivate the next generation to be something more?   Line 6 Im not sure of, though I know this interpretation is a bit different, but I dont get Wilhelms at all.  I see more warnings here of what not to do rather than what to do.An image of my employment for the next year. 31.1.3.5I usually see 31 as being about two things being attracted to each other or things coming together that need each other.  Dont know if the job needs me, but I need it.line 1 I always see as sort of superfluous, only a twitch in the toe so inconsequential, then why mention it?line 3 I think is saying not to go off half cocked, to form a plan, maybe make a list of schools Im interested in and have openings, make sure they are within reasonable distance, etc rather than just panicing and sending letters to every school in town.line 5 Be firm but not inflexible??  How do I secure a teaching job for next year? 5 unchangingWait for the right time/opportunity, be patientOk, anyone see anything else? Moment of synchronicity.  Asked the universe before I started the I Ching readings to speak to me, let me know what they wanted.  As I was writing this, the song Time of Your Life came on...Another turning point, a fork stuck in the roadTime grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to goSo make the best of this test, and don't ask whyIt's not a question, but a lesson learned in timeIt's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.I hope you had the time of your life.Gotta love it"
2443,"Gooday, WF.When trying to determine time, do the lines count or only the hexagrams themselves?I asked, In what month will X next contact me?(my question was not when will we next talk; it was intentionally about X contacting me)The answer was 1.2>13.The translations I read of the hexagrams and changing line reflected my ""vision"" or ""intuition"" about the future (I have no logical reason to think X will ever contact me). Does that always happen--that a timeframe designated by a hexagram AND the actual text BOTH answer the question? Because I did not necessarily expect to get an answer that made sense...I thought that in this type of question, the answer might just sort of be a ""symbol"" that stood for a certain time/month, nothing more. Curious to hear your thoughts.Chirp-Chirp"
2444,"Hello everyone!  I have just recently began a relationship with the I Ching, and have gained so much from it's insight and your website.  I'm sorry to ask for help before being able to contribute anything, but this reading really stumped me.I'm in complicated relationship with a man (why are they always complicated lol).  He gives me mixed messages, runs hot and cold, ranges from kindness to cruelty.  I would have let this relationship go, except he is in a very desperate place in his life and I can't abandon him in good conscience.  So i went to the Yi to explore his feelings for me.What does he feel for me?  18.4 > 50Does he feel an attraction for me?  32.2.5 >31Why doesn't he love me? 30I was going to struggle on on my own, but he doesn't love me because of luminosity?HELP!Thanks to all you darling people -ruschelP.S.  Brutal truth is ok.  I'm pretty tough and prefer knowing what I'm dealing with.  So please, don't hold back on your insights!"
2445,"Dear All, I'm experiencing a lot of romantic/sexual tension with a close male friend/housemate right now, it's gotten quite difficult to handle for both of us. During our previous friendly chats he's always mentioned he finds it difficult to approach girls, but on the other hand I do not buy that theory - he's a man, after all, if he really feels for a girl, he surely will eventually go for her.So I asked - what's stopping him from making a move on me? Got 23 unchanging. Is it a blindingly obvoius answer that he's afraid our household/frienship will split as a result? or are there more subtle undertones to this hex?Comments will be much appreciated, as ever "

2448,"hii.!!i am a businessman, and i am doing good in business, but for some reason, i feel so dissatisfied with my life so i did i ching reading to give me the image of the situation.hexagram 35 chin/progresswith no changing lines....can someone help me with this?"
2449,"Some days ago I asked for your help to interpret hexagram 63 (changing lines 3 and 5) and derived hexagram 24. It is about a a relationship I had with a man some years ago. When we started, he was getting divorced from a wealthy and famous woman and he had job problems, appart from other more serious ones (he went out with different women at the same time, etc.). He was used to living in a wealthy environment and his situation was not the best then.Despite being problematic, he was very sensitive and I can say it is the most important relationship I've had till now (I'm 36). We both suffered a lot in this relationship and it finished three years ago. We live in different cities and we have not seen again since then (2006). In the meantime, he tried to contact me but I didn't give him any opportunity. Last year he even suggested me working for him (in different cities) but I didn't like the way he did: he only contacted me by email or SMS.I cannot stop thinking about him and I'm suffering a lot. It's as if I have lost the control of my life and I just leave life goes on. I feel sad, weak and, despite having a good work, I don't feel the strong woman I was before. The last time he contacted me was March 2008. He asked me about a job issue (he wanted to make business with me) but I refused. Since then he stopped any contact.Two weeks ago I asked for your help to interpret hexagram 63 (changing lines 3 and 5) and derived hexagram 24 about the possibility of contacting him. I decided to take my time a little bit. Last weekend I had to visit his city, where I had not gone since 2006, when I was with him. When I came back home, I felt very nostalgic and I ask I Ching what would happened if I sent him a message. I obtained 12.2.4.6 (Terrific!!!). I finally sent him a SMS: ""I've just arrived from Madrid and I remembered you. Things go well for me. I'm sure you are happy as well"". Four minutes later, he answered: ""I am very happy you are well. The next time you come, just if you want, you can give me a call and go for a walk"". The real thing is that I know the perspective is not good (12.2.4.6>29). I feel nostalgic, and I know everything has finished, but, on the other hand, I do not feel strong enough to forget the past. Can you help me interpret this hexagram more deeper, please?I very much appreciate your experience in I Ching."

2451,"I'm wishing I hadn't asked this question, but I did...and now I'm hoping for feedback and insight into the answer because I know I am often too narrow minded regarding my own questions to open my thoughts to the bigger message/picture the IC is often offering.I have just recently reconnected with a man whom I had a crush on in the 6th grade!!  Soooo silly  I never told anyone of this crush and he barely knew I existed (he is 4 years older than I).  So although it's a reconnection of sorts, it's actually more of a first connection really...  He lives pretty far away from me though for anything big to ever come of this.......And although it is way too early and vague for me to be contemplating such things at this point, being hopelessly curious(and feeling a little like a crushing 6th grader all over again), I asked the IC for insight into the possibilities with this man.Response: 23.6. changing to 2.This doesn't seem too hopeful for much coming from this.  23/splitting apart? Doesn't seem the best hex to get regarding a new interest from an old secret crush!!?!!   But the receptivity of hex 2 almost sounds hopeful of something positive coming of it...Any thoughts?~Namaste~"
2452,"Hi,Firstly I should indicate to you I am female....and I did my very first consult last night and am very unsure on how to interpret it.  I am using Wu Wei's translation which indicates return of a dark force, however I see there are other translations that indicate 'coming to meet'.Long story kind of short, I recently ended my relationship of ten months with my boyfriend as he felt he needed a bit of time apart/space (things were not going well for him with work, money etc which may have contributed to this).  I thought things were going well, though there was an issue with his drinking (he's a 'happy' drunk - I just felt he drank too much).  There was also the complication of 10 years difference between us - I'm 36, he's 26 but we still got along great and had similar values etc though I think he always felt he wasn't good enough for me as I am fairly successful.  We had planned to move in together in a couple of months and perhaps this also scared him a bit.So, back to the oracle...My question was along the lines of....""if we get back together, can we have a happy and fulfilling family life together"" (I want children and given my age can't wait that long...).The interesting thing about hex 44 coming up is that he contacted me a couple of days ago to see if I wanted to meet him for a drink/lunch as the way we broke up wasn't ideal (as I did it over the phone).  I agreed and we will be meeting up in a weeks time.Now the 'coming to meet' translation makes sense to me...but if there is a dark force does that mean I should be wary about a reconcilliation with him.  I notice there is also mention in translations that give warning of a woman who appears gentle but is powerful and bascially you shouldn't marry her...well I probably AM that woman as I am a pretty strong person - and I do give away my heart too easily.  Or is there possibly some other dark force that I need to be wary of that will prevent us from reconcilling?  Perhaps he is the dark force even though I consider him to be very sweet, and loving.As my first attempt perhaps I should've chosen a much more simple question Any guidance would be most appreciated and I do apologise for the long explanation ."

2455,"Hello,Some of you recently helped me with a relationship problem.  I regret not being more forthcoming about the details - although the interpretations helped me a lot, I'm learning from reading Clarity that the more info and truth the senior members have, the greater the depth of the interpretations.  I'm also learning that the steady members are worthy of great trust with even sensitive topics.  I hope I can earn a place, even a small place, among you some day.But the honest truth - if I were a hexagram, right now I'd be a straight up ""4""!  I never realized when I began with the I Ching - the relationship is deep, powerful, comes with restraints and demands.  Not egotistical demands that Yi needs for ""its"" own fulfillment, but demands required to stay on the true path.  The Yi is changing my life, frankly in ways that are bigger than me.  Ergo the following.I have been considering taking a part-time job at my church, a Methodist church.  Over the past two years I have grown as a member, becoming increasingly involved.  Now, I'm a solitary traveler - involved is a relative term here.  But the support and fellowship and grace I received there helped to pull me out of a very dark, years long depression.  Also, the pastor is honestly extraordinary.  She is one of those rare people who truly walks Christ's path without the fundamentalist and extremist views that terrify me about Christian organized religion (sorry if I offend, these are my personal views).  She and I have become extremely close; we meet weekly in a half-therapy session/half-catch-up between friends.  Her companionship has become invaluable in my life.Anyway, the pastor has offered me the opportunity to apply for a part-time secretarial position at the church.  The expectations of the pastor, and the congregation, are for me to grow in my place in the church and my Christian faith . . . .Here's the rub.  I think Yi is guiding me to let my association with the church and this job go.  Beyond that, I think Yi is suggesting my true path is letting go of the majority of the Christian faith.  I don't mind letting go of alot of it, but the concept of the Christ has been central to my life . . . . and of course I need the job and money, but I've gotten by before and will be ok again, whatever happens with that.Anyway, I asked Yi if the job is part of my correct path?  Received 50.1.5 > 1If I'm reading this right this is way bigger than I ever imagined.  Sorry for the length of this, just wanted you all to know the details.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.NamasteDawnP.S.  Sorry if I sound egotistical - I know this isn't life shattering compared to world hunger, mental illness, the AIDS epidemic, peace in the Middle East.  It's just rocking my small world, please help me stop the shaking!"
2456,"it sounds melodramatic, but i feel as if my life has suddenly become a landmine of sadness and worry. one of my brothers is very ill and he doesn't seem to be geeting proper medical care, and the one I love has left me, and nothing looks familiar anymore, and I feel on the edge of breaking down.

2460,"Dear reader,The reason me and ex split was due to third parties who did not want us to be together. They created an illusion that he was seeing them, and also told him stuff about me that made him angry towards me.I used to think he cheated on me with someone else, but now I know it was not true.Our breakup was bad because I think I brought up the other party and he was really mad at me. There was someone intending to spoil the whole thing between us, and it is someone close to him (a friend, who fancies him).I still have feelings for him, because I know he was faithful afterall. But I needed some tips on how to approach him and clear the air.I am not sure what the iching says by 30.2.3>3830.2 sounds like a good hexagram. 38 - I am not sure?the story of me and my ex has been on for a long time; we split up last year because the female friend didnt like me and him together.Does anyone have any suggestions on questions to ask the iching to solve the situation?thank you so much."

2465,"Hello Forum Friends!Well I recently had an astrology reading which advised me that I have to take advantage of these next few years in order to develop a new skill.  A shift in career certainly seems to be calling, I am tired of unstable temporary jobs.   But I keep putting it off, mainly because I don't know what I would study, and I often get this feeling like it's not necessary, that things will just work themselves out.  I mean who really knows what the future could bring, so why worry?  But now this astrologer got me thinking about it again...So really, Is it important to develop a new skill now?37.2,6  changes to 5"
2466,"I recently had a falling out with a long time online friend because I believe (based on many things) that it is a man who has been pretending to be a woman. (I'm a woman)When I confronted him/her I got a very angry response.  There were also no offers to prove to me that this is a woman even though this person can clearly see that I find this perceived deception very disturbing.  His/her response was simply, ""Let's go our own ways.""  I haven't heard from him/her since.Because this is someone I've spoken to for years I asked,""How does B. feel about the fact that we're no longer speaking to one another?""I got 44.2.3.5.6 to 16My understand of 44 leads me to believe that he/she is quite affected by this and has not gone ""his/her own way.""  In fact, I'd say that he/she is a bit obsessed by this falling out and that it is actually drawing him/her to me in a strange way.  Any other ideas would be appreciated."
2467,"Hi all ,At this point in my life I'm looking to change one or two things. One being primarily a house shift, as I work fairly demanding shift work, and am finding the travel a bit of a bore.  I really don't enjoy living in this town. Although I do enjoy my garden, I am finding that to be a load as well, possibly due to my erratic working hours and the ensuing fatigue.  Now there's a 2 bedroom apartment with a stunning view up for sale in the city, about 20 mins walk from my work (5 by car). I'm sorely tempted on this one.  The 2nd bedroom would be easy to rent, because of location.  And I would have more time and energy to do the things I enjoy doing.  However, my 89 year father - who refuses to plop himself into a resthome - lives just down the road from me. Other family members are quite happy with this arrangement.  Gosh. I wonder why?! (I know that really what my father wants is for me to move in with him and play nursemaid).  I'm not prepared to do that, as I know full well that it would lead to me either going round the twist, or having a short life.  Quite possibly both.  So my question was 'if I move into town, what will the repercussions be from my father?'  And I got hex 20, no changing lines.Of course, I'd really like to interpret this as: 'live your own life, according to your own needs and wants, not those of other people', but I'd like to get your views on the matter also!cheers, Kiwigal"

2469,"Thanks in advance for helping me understand this reading...Was I wrongfully charged for an eye exam? answer: 53.2.4.5 to 50I had an eye exam recently but before I went, I checked with my insurance provider and the they said that my exam should be covered 100%. I was only required to pay a $20 co-pay (out of pocket) to the doctor for my visit. However, I ended up paying out $100 total for the visit and I'm not sure of the optometrist's reasoning for this.The reading seems to suggest that the matter will be resolved well but I'm not sure of the details. Any insight on what direction the Yi is giving me here is greatly appreciated. Can anyone help me break down this reading?Thanks!Bears"
2470,"I do need help with a reading, but thought I would reintroduce myself and share a bit of irony first.  Feel free to skip this part, especially if you never knew me before.  The part below that I need help with is longer than I expected.  Ok, I was here several years ago as Seeker.  Yeah, those who knew me just ran away screaming, lol.  But Im much better now.  It was why I left.  I realized I was not in a good place, and I was becoming almost addicted to the I Ching.  I needed to get myself and my life in order, and so I did.  I got divorced, moved to a new place with my parents help, became a teacher, found a gift and a purpose, moved from Florida to Tennessee, and oh, of course, in the midst of all that moved on from my Thomas obsession.  And we're caught up, but here's the irony.  I moved Oct before last, but come back to Fla for most of the summer.  My daughter has court ordered visitation with her father for 8 weeks during the summer, and if I stay in town, I get to see her once a week during that time, sort of a reverse visitation.  Last summer my parents were still in Fl, packing to move (they built a house 45 minutes from us in Tn), so I was staying with them.  I spent a lot of time hanging out at the bookstore in the evening.  One night as I was leaving I heard a familiar voice, but one I couldnt place.  I turned and found Thomas approaching me.  Yi is always right, we did meet again  I was actually shocked he approached me.  Lets face it, he would have been justified in taking out a restraining order.  He asked if we could get together for fun (totally ok with that, my life is different now), we texted a few times, but then he stopped with no explanation.  I was a bit confused, but what could I do.  And it was just a hookup, so no big.  I figured it had offered some closure as I confirmed for myself that I had moved on, and maybe that was why the universe had given me that moment.  Awww, but the universe was apparently not done, because a few weeks after I went back to Tn I received a text stating he had dropped his phone in the pool and only recently got it fixed.  He did not have my number outside the phone.  He knew I was gone, but wanted to apologize anyway so as not to leave it on a bad note.  I accepted and let him know I would be back this summer.  He said if I was still interested to text him when I came back.  I returned a couple of weeks ago, but had not made a decision about seeing him.  Once again, the universe gave a push, and I received a text from him that he thought he had seen me at the bookstore (recurring theme apparently) and was I back in town.  We did get together and had a great night.  We were going to get together again, but then he met someone he wanted to explore a relationship with, and I wished him well.  The odd thing is that I dont think we're done yet.  I was curled up with him and my hand was over his heart, and in the middle of the night I woke with the oddest impression that his heart was broken.  As I lay there words came into my head that he will meet someone young and beautiful, and he will be her world, but he must open his heart first.  I also had the thought that he is not fulfilling his potential, he could be so much more.  This is not a unique occurence in my life now.  It will probably sound crazy, but I swear, people come into my life and the universe speaks to me either in dream or like this one, and then there is something I have to help them with.  Sometimes it is a short lived acquintance, and sometimes the person stays in my life.  After he texted about meeting someone, I consulted Yi and got the following:Why am I back in Thomas life?  47 unchanging  he is oppressed I thinkWhat do I still have left to do for Thomas? 39.4.6  I believe this echos my impressionWhat does the summer hold for us?  46 unchanging.  hmmmFeel free to comment on these, especially if Im misreading it, but I can wait to see how it plays out, will be a learning experience if nothing else.Finally, what I actually need help with:This is actually a problem for me.  I have been teaching 9th grade English at a school in Tenn.  Its a school that most people do not want to teach at, but I chose it because I wanted to be where I was most needed.  As they do have difficulty getting teachers, I thought I could really make a difference there.  The year started with an obstacle as I had applied to have my FL license transferred to Tn, and it was still pending when I got hired.  When the county tried to rush it, they informed me I was missing two tests as they dont accept the ones taken for the FL license.  However, they granted an interim license which allowed me to teach for the year while I met the requirements for the full license.  I passed both my tests just before my final evaluation with my principal.  At that evaluation he informed me that I would get a letter stating my job had to be posted because I had the interim license, but not to worry, that he fully intended  to rehire me, and he could recommend it based on the fact that I should have my full license by then.  I spoke to him a couple of times after that and he never indicated anything different.  Less than a week before school ended, he finally scheduled my summative, a meeting with him and the vice principal who had also evaluated me.  At that meeting, he gave me an eval sheet that scored me below proficiency on everything, despite the fact that my students had the lowest failure rate on the state exam, and then denied he ever told me he would rehire me.  The summative eval was also completely inconsistent with previous evals.  I went into absolute shock.  At that point, most other teaching positions had been filled.  I was suddenly left coming to Fl for the summer with no prospect for a job when I got back.  My other option was to not come and hope something else came open.  Note that my daughter would have been devastated as she is only 11 and would not want to go 8 weeks without seeing me, plus I would have to come up with money to fly her down.  I talked to some of my colleagues, and they all said they would write recommendations, but then one pulled me aside and said I needed to contact the teachers assoc.  Tn state law says teachers must receive a nonhire letter by April 15 if they are not being rehired.  I received no such letter; even the interim letter was not received until May 1.  TEA said they believed I had a case, though the law was somewhat ambiguous on interim teachers, but it does not specifically exclude them.  Oh, I had never received a copy of the principals eval, so I asked.  It is pretty useless as he only listed the codes, but I looked them up and again inconsistent, but he wrote rehire at the top.  Dont know if that helps, but at least it shows I did not hallucinate.  Oh, there are rumours that he drinks.  Lovely.  In the meantime, all of my colleagues recommended that I continue with my plans, as there was not much I could do until the end of the summer when last minute positions would be posted.  It isnt costing me much to be here because my parents house is still for sale, so Im staying in it for free.  I did consult Yi about what to do and got 7 unchanging, so that seemed like TEA was the way to go.  I asked about staying and looking for a different job and got 39.1.  Obviously, though I am here in Fl with my friends, who have given unending support, Im still rather nervous about it.  There has been no progress because the TEA legal handling it went on vacation and just got back.  I realized today I had never asked about the situation, only what to do.  I asked why did I lose the job?  24.4.6  I then asked what do I need to do about the job now? 61 unchanging.  Now Im confused.  Is it saying Im supposed to return to something else?  Who is the friend in line 4?  Maybe the teacher who helped me, or is it someone outside of this.  I have a strong spiritual connection to a friend in Fl.  Please tell me this is not saying Im supposed to return to Fl.  If the universe wanted me in FL, it should have given me the means to stay there, I only moved because of my parents and the economy got so bad.  Line 6 is really confusing, what did I miss?  This hex is one I dread because it still gives me fits.  I felt better after reading Rosado's memorizing thread on this tho, cause they had difficulty with it too.  The 61 I could see two ways.  It could be about continuing with TEA so that the truth is seen.  It occurred to me when it first happened that the universe might be using me as an implement of change as others in the county have had problems due to ambiguous law on interims.  Im just the first one to stand up and fight it.  Again, wouldnt be the first time.  However, I have also had it come up when I was in denial and needed to tell myself the truth about something.  I couldnt find this one on the memorizing thread.  It didnt come up in the search, and Hillary's list for that thread ends at 53.  I didnt go too far into it because I had already spent several hours researching the first one.  I had been thinking about coming back anyway, especially with the ironic Thomas thing.  I figured maybe this was telling me it was time to return.   Doh!!!  Talk about irony.  Thanks in advance for any of you brave enough to try and help me again.  (Leaves muttering to self, ""I will not make these people crazy again; I will not make these people crazy again"")"

2480,"first 37 unchanging.second 37.1.3.5.6 to 2.i was sad, and now i am not anymore.i asked the iching twice about andrew, first what I should avoid doing in order to keep him.this guy once used to be my teacher, and i had a powerful crash on him until he told me he was homosexual. (the crash lasted longer, of course). a beautiful, beautiful frienship blossomed between the two of us: we have been travelling together the whole world, dried up each other's tears, confessed the utmost secrets, worries, desires, hopes. We are very similar, by nature and by nurture, but still so different, so much complementing each other.still sometimes when I am alone (we now live apart, in two different countries) I feel I can lose him. Not that I rationally believe it; just that it happens to most, I guess, to be afraid to lose this wonderful feeling of being understood, cherished, loved by somebody who's no further intention than loving you as a friend.First answer: 37 unchanging. How come, I think: Am I too maternal? too insistent? I needed to know more, so I asked Yi what is the way to make our friendship blossom:curious, once more 37 (this time with many changing lines, to 2).The response I received was, in the end, the very core of every important relationship: let it flow, don't suffer because there's no need to, know that sometimes it's normal to argue, know in your heart that what you have is going to stay the way it is, in the good and the bad.Seen this, I think the first answer was very much a statement, not an answer: family is family. You love it, you hate it, but it's your family. And Andrew is my family.I am a novice to the book of changes, would appreciate to have your insights (even if they are not as optimistic as mine).Blessings,Lili"

He's not very open emotionally, but I know he cares and I do to but sometimes he infuriates me, but then I feel guilty...He also has a horrible habit of comparing himself to others (his circle of friends and their 'ideal' marriages and children) which also makes me angry because I think he's highlighting the non-ideal in his own family life. He has a girlfriend but I think he'll be an eternal bachelor - even though he seems to idealize marriage and 2.4 children I think it just isn't his nature and he needs to accept that!I got angry again with him yesterday - he just makes me feel wrought up inside, and I'm not sure why, but I think it's probably because I don't feel good enough for him (at the moment especially) and he always talks about himself (men!) I got 1.2, 5 (again! I have only asked a couple of times about him!) > 30Looking at past interpretations 1.5 is said to refer to your attitude i.e I could have a good relationship with him if I choose not to fight but rise above it when he annoys me by willfully putting his foot in it!

2484,I was meditating half an hour ago and it came to me to ask what CFS/ME is and received this interesting response 42:1 - 20I'm feeling like this is saying that it is a grounding mechanism which comes in to place when it is highly crucial for the person to do a lot of serious inner/emotional work.What does everyone else think?

2490,"On April 17 this year my mother and I saw something move over our car, with lights and panels on it from left to right while we were on the highway.  It was about, well at one point, maybe 15 feet above us at a 45 degree angle to the driver side (my side).  It traveled for a while at our speed, then slowly disappeared, seemed to have stopped or gone the other way.  It was scary, I half don't believe it myself, but my mother saw it too, so ... and I couldn't stop and get out because it was so close and I couldn't look more closely because I was driving.

2491,"Hello to all, and thanks again to those who have shown support in the past week (my long-term partner and I have separated). The grief is still very intense, and I'm staying with a friend while I look for my own place (it was decided that my ex would take the apartment). I feel I must believe that the writing is on the wall (this really appears to be the end), but in a certain way this cake just doesn't feel done, and while I don't want to hold out false hopes or use the YI to give me unhelpful illusions about the situation, I drew a few times this morning.First I asked whether it was appropriate for me to withdraw for now and take no further action. I received 5 unchanging, which seemed to say yes quite emphatically.Then I received 57.4 changing to 44 after asking a) If I follow the advice of hexagram 5, where might the situation be heading? and b) have we really lost each other for good?I don't believe in fate as a string of predetermined events, and even the I Ching shows us how fate and choices are inextricably tied. But am I wrong to think these readings suggest there might be a chance of a new start between us, if not a full-blown reconciliation? again, my heart is so sore, sometimes I wonder if I'm just feeding myself with false hopes and making the grieving process more difficult.Thank you again for listening, and any insights are welcome."

Change in the fifth place means:    If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.    Supreme good fortune.    Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.    Change at the top means:    He brings increase to no one.    Indeed, someone even strikes him.    He does not keep his heart constantly steady.    Misfortune.Can anyone help me decipher this?Regards"
2493,"Tonight I asked the oracle ""what is happening in my life""?. A vague question- I'm still contemplating on. Receiving hexagram 63 no changing lines.In general...The last week I have been really shrugging off my studies and almost needing to re energize myself. I find when I'm alone I start to contemplate where I'm really going, am I doing the right thing etc. And its not that I get depressed but doubt comes in quite abit when I get in these moods. Linking this up to my other hexagrams I received in the last month or 2 such as:""what will be the effect if I follow Dr.Yan, TCM, Qigong, Acupunture, & Chinese esoterics to become a relationship/self-help coach to better myself and have potential relationships as a man"" Receiving 2 unchanging.""What is my purpose in life"" 48-->43 changing lines 1 and 4""What are my unique gifts"" 55-->14 changing lines 2 and 6Overall...I think I'm on the right path I really do, but part of me wants to run back to the old things and just do things which I know (for better or for worse). Going on abit of a confession, it almost feels like I'm isolating myself for ""the great"" later on, although I've said take the high road all my life...part of me knows if I just let go of everything (like expectations, morals etc.) I could get what I want immediately but not ""get it"" so to speak. It'd be a bandage. Feels like a real fight inside me between 2 opposing forces. (Do whatever to fit in, get instant gratification or keep your eye improving yourself & everything will work out splendid though you gotta sacrifice now)I don't doubt the oracle, I don't doubt my teachers/masters who've help me grow tremendously in every aspect, I doubt myself if what I'm doing really will pay off in the end. (I know it sounds messed). But my view is am I just fooling myself/wasting time in the great elaborate joke or am I actually doing something which will make me happy and grow as a individual, man, human, friend, & future lover. Its pushing it...it really is, but this struggle always comes in myself and I usually say, ""no Zac...your fine, your on a good path, look @ the changes you've made, etc."" as reassurance. I'm actually doing that indirectly postings here. But ya...I hate saying it I don't know, its like complete darkness. Just need a torch to say, yes or no- though I know that only comes from myself.Any views are appreciated, and THANKS in advance if you read the whole thing..its a long winded vent partly :bows:Last edited: Jun 15, 2009"
2494,"Dear Forum friends,For reasons beyond my control I had to change trainer/riding instructor so I asked the I Ching: what do you think about R as a trainer for me and my horse? And I got 50 > 16 which for me seems to be a very positive answer. Bearing in mind I would like to prepare my horse & myself for dressage competitions, the choice of trainer is an important one. Thanks a lot in advance for any comments."
2495,"Hello!Some help needed: the question in question was ""What will be the nature of the relationship between X and Y by the end of the year?"" and IC answered 47 changing lines 1,3,4,5 to hex 11Hex 47 totally makes sense since there is a huge amount of exhaustion involved (especially the inner one, thinking, worrying, wondering, etc.) and the changing lines make sense, as well.However, are the lines 2 and 6 of hex 11 supposed to be taken into consideration too, since there are four changing lines in the hex 47? If so, I cannot grasp the meaning...Thank you for your thoughts.sollina"
2496,"So many questions have been asked about relationships.  I found this quote by Confucius and thought it was inspiring.  Maybe it doesn't go here, but it's a sort of reading, it's Confucian, and it pertains to the sharing of readings.Confucius says of two, separated:""Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.Now the course is checked, now it runs straight again.Here the winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words, There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in silence.But when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.And when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts,Their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.""Last edited: Jun 15, 2009"
2497,"I'll take a stab and say no?For 3 years the woman has no child, but in the end nothing can stop her.Gentle shift from friendship to romance?thanks anyone who can interpret this."
2498,i receive this hexagram 48 line 5 in response for his attraction for me. Can you please help with interpretation?
2499,Hexagram 44.1.2.3.6>17I read the lines and they seem destructive?Does it mean he does not love her?thanks for any insight.
2500,"Hi again this answer baffled me because of the seemingly opposite tones of 15 and 51 - from modesty/humbleness to shock!I asked the IC about a guy....""Does A like me i.e. find me appealing?"" and I received 15.1.3.4 > 51I asked IC to clarify this further because I was confused about the 15 and 51 and I got 2 unchanging.15.1.3.4 talks about merit and modesty of that merit, making everything favourable for progress... then 51 talks about shock but also arousing.....so could it mean he's excited by me being humble about my merits?? Wilhelm says this about 51....""The shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths of the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy and merriment can follow upon it. When a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced by outside influences....""Hex 2 talks about being receptive and things happening at a deeper level - so in asking the IC to clarify the response, could this mean A is receptive to me? Or that I need to remain receptive to the situation (i.e. since I asked the IC to clarify the 15 to 51).If anyone could shed further light that would be greatly appreciated :bows:thankssofia"
2501,"This morning I drew hexagram 23 unchanging for the first time in a very long time, when asking what to meditate on in preparation for what could be a very difficult day. I'm supposed to see my ex tonight for the first time since she left a few days ago. I'm going to follow previous counsel of friends, the YI and some on this forum to be gentle and calm and not get angry with her or lash out, but getting this only seems to confirm: there's nothing to do now but accept that this partnership has fallen apart, and that in fact it has been slowly doing so for a long time. It's been several days now and it's become abundantly clear that this is what she wants, and I won't and can't stand in the way or try to talk her out of it. But nine years crumbling like that. I know separation and divorce are daily affairs, but I never realized quite how much like a death they really are. I don't know I've ever felt the meaning of the heart of sadness this vividly. As a follow-up question, I asked, ""How can I find myself and get my joy back?""I drew 55, Abundance, changing at lines 3 and 6, to 21, Biting Through. Hmm...not very comforting somehow. I guess I may just have to accept this dark period for a while.Thank you for listening."
2502,"I recently came back into contact with an old friend that I haven't seen for ten years. I quickly came to feel that I had to confess to him something that I did ten years ago. I knew it was going to upset him deeply, and make him think very much less of me, but I felt strongly that we had no chance of recreating a meaningful friendship unless he knew all the facts.He's said little in response - it's clear that he is very upset. He seems to have gone away for a while. But he has also emailed me once or twice, and seems to be looking for me to do something to make him feel better about the situation.I asked for the best way to respond, and got 19 (Nearng) unchanging, from which I infer that I need to be the grown-up here, and to approach this from as spiritual a perspective as possible, rather than trying to achieve any particular outcome.So I then asked what I could do at this time to help my friend, assuming that it was appropriate for me to do so.I received:59, DispersingLine 6    ‘Dispersing blood.    Leave, far away, get out.    Not a mistake.’29, Repeating chasmI would love some help interpreting this. It looks to me as though I may be being told that it's best for him to be far away from me right now. What do you think?"
2503,"W.Fox, Please Show Me the Increase!I've been getting a lot of 42 lately. I believe 42 has to do with self-improvement and ""readying"" oneself for opportunity, but I thought the opportunity is supposed to show itself once those preparations are made as opposed to making opportunities for oneself, which is more how I see Hexagram 35. Yes? No? Basically, I am growing and changing quickly, but have not had any doors lunge (or even squeak) open in my face, so am looking around for increase, but not really seeing any. Maybe I'm just being impatient, but believe you me, I've waited a very long time for outside change so if waiting is the blessing, i'm now looking for a curse!Within the past 2-3 weeks I asked,What do I have to look forward to romantically? 42.3What can I do to be happy? 42.Is 'X' happy? 42.4How does 'X' rank amongst all the loves I will experience throughout my lifetime? 42.2Now 'X' happens to live in a different city, but also happens to be looking for a job, one of which could bring him to my city. The Yi refuses to discuss my future with me, however, because the Yi knows how I am. So when I asked about ""our"" future, I got 52 moving to 50, which told me nothing other than one way or another, the bloke's very existence is enough to help me transform....which is what I'm doing...while I wait for increase.Last edited: Jun 9, 2009"
2504,"Many threads on this board are unfinished/unrequited love stories--so I thought, why not attempt a thread about finished/requited ones, revealing the hexagrams received at the time of the relationship's beginning, or ending.Hexagram thrown at the very start of the longest (10 yr) relationship of my life:10.5I really puzzled over that one. To this day still do, in fact. It's more than three years in the past now, with no contact for at least two. There may be more to come on that 10.5 but I'm not counting on it.On two occasions prior to that one, almost 20 years ago & regarding two different relationships, I drew the dreaded 54.6. Correct in both cases, as it turned out. One of them eventually became a good friend again who, after announcing to me his intention to get married, informed me I was one of only two women in the world qualified to receive his proposal. Reader, I did not marry him.The other just recently reconnected. He is married to the aristocrat his mother had always intended him for, from the time of birth. So he told me as I read his tarot cards, foreplay the last night we spent together. He does seem to genuinely like her a lot though, judging by the number of times they ""poke"" one another on Facebook.Sadly got that line again more recently, over a new relationship that seemed more promising--don't they all. Lots of regulation 54.6 hitches showing from the start (he never did quite manage to get that divorce, etc.) but still, somehow, keep hoping--don't we all.Last edited: Jun 11, 2009"
2505,"Dear friends,I am new in this page. I am Spanish but have not found any Spanish web page to consult with other people about I Ching.  I am quite new in this topic.I would like to ask you about a relationship I had some years ago. It was very passionate but the guy had serious problems (he had just divorced from a wealthy woman, job problems, etc.) and I finally finished because everything spoilt. It all finished three years ago but he was still contacting me until March 2008. I was so unsure about him that I didn't give him any opportunity.The problem is that I am still very much in love, although I know there were problems between us. During this time I tried to give him the idea I didn't want to see him again.I asked I Ching what would happen if I contacted him now and I obtained hexagram 63 (changing lines 3 and 5) and derived hexagram 24.Would you be so kind to help interpret this?Thanks a lot!"
2506,"I started a thread on this issue last December. http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=7131 and now I'm back with a similar dilemma.  Last night at our end of year party as I walked past ""S"" he stepped in front of me and said, ""Can we please be friends again?""  We had not spoken to each other for the last few months unless I had to for appearance's sake. I had to go to his classroom to load something on his computer a few weeks ago and in front of the students I spoke graciously and cheerfully to him, but if we bump into each other when no one is around I always nod and make a quick escape.  So, I said we'd have to talk about what happened before we could just ""be friends"" again, so we did.  Unfortunately, this discussion took place under the effects of alcohol and I am very unclear about everything we discussed.  I'm not even sure how the conversation ended and whether we resolved anything or not.  I think we did and I think I agreed to try and be friendlier toward him at school. But what I do know is that I did not tell him the truth about how I feel.  The truth is that I am a happily married woman with 2 kids and for some reason I can't fathom - I have developed an insane attraction to a kid 20 years younger than me.  I don't want to be attracted to him and I certainly don't want to cheat on my husband or act on my feelings, but I have been trying for the last 6 months to convince myself that it is nothing, that I'm just being silly, and here I am obsessing about it all over again!  I did an i-ching cast to this question, ""Should I tell him the truth now or just keep ignoring him?""  And the answer I got was Hexagram 20.  So, what does that mean?  Is there any point in telling him how I really feel, since I know these feelings are wrong and inappropriate.  Won't that just put unnecessary pressure on the poor kid that he just doesn't need?  But I realize now that I can't be friends with him again because I will blurt something out one of these days and I don't think that's a good idea.  Is it possible for 2 people to be friends if one of them is attracted to the other one? Does anyone have any thoughts about what the message of Hexagram 20 would be in this situation?"
2507,Hmmm... not sure what to make of it.  Sorry... I already shut down the browser that showed what hexagram it changed to.
2508,"Hello,A few months ago, I saw someone I had had a brief flirtation with at my old work-place, with another girl, also from the old work place. They looked to be in a couple. I was leaving the area on the day I saw them, didn't feel hurt or anything, but it was by chance that I saw them and I wondered why (there was a time I thought something would happen with us but at the time he had a girlfriend who also worked at the same place - seems he was doing the rounds!)I asked what I was supposed to learn from seeing them.I received 37.4 > 9 which I took to mean that he's found someone that makes him happy - would you agree? Was the Yi saying I was not capable of being that person for him? (Perhaps because I'm not stable myself and so don't 'increase' people so well?)I then asked a similar question recently, about whether someone I keep thinking about (more fool me) is emotionally involved with another.I received 37.4> 9Does that scream yes!!??Would really appreciate what you think the Yi has been drawing my attention to, with these two readings given to a similar sort of Q.Thanks so much for your thoughts:bows:"
2509,"I know that there is another thread dealing with this hexagram but I am absolutely desperate for any advice regarding my situation.  I swore that I wouldn't post a relationship hex, but here I am doing this very thing!!   Anyway, I am in a long distance relationship and haven't heard anything from my guy in over 4 days!!  I'm really worried but as this is a relatively new relationship (only about a month old) I don't know how to contact him other than by email or IM.  So I turned to the ICHING and asked - what do you see happening between Will and me?  It gave me hexagram 37 changing at 4 to hexagram 13.  Should I continue to worry about the lack of contact or consider this hex to be a good sign and wait for him to contact me?I also threw the coins again and asked - why hasn't Will contacted me - and again hex 37 this time changing at lines 1, 2, and 4 changing to 44.  Please could someone help me to decipher what is going on here?  Thank you for any help that you can give."
2510,"Heya all,I just did a reading in a fit of frustration. The reading itself, the act of focusing and framing a question, did calm me down a little but I need a little help with the interpretation because I don't get how the relating hexagram gel with the primary hexagram.Background: I'm based in a totally different continent from my mum and my mum has this fixation ever since I turned 24 to see me married. I'm 29 soon. And even if we are on different continents, or when I am back home for a visit, she'll ask me when am I getting married and we'll just erupt into a massive arguement. I hate it when she gets my back when I am not ready and no matter how I exlpain, she doesn't understand. I have been in an on-off relationship with a guy for the past 4 years, but nothing concrete to the extent of marriage. I want to get married, though not just now, I still have stuff I wanna do and especially when I don't see anything concrete guy in the horizon.Mum just sent me another email today, asking me when am I getting married. I was driven up the wall and did a reading ""When will I get married?"". I got 46.2.5. The resulting hexagram is 39.I don't get the 39. Isn't that suppose to be bad despite the rather more hopeful lines.Help please?? "
2511,"I have just recently turned to the I ching, because I'm currently in a situation where I just don't know where to go, and who to turn to.I'm in a relationship right now, and 4 months into the relationship, something happened that almost ended our new relationship. But I really want to be with the person I'm with right now, so I keep hanging on. Things have definitely gotten worse, with increasing intense arguments, and several attempts on his part to break up with me. However, I still keep on begging him to calm down and stay with me. I'm in college right now, so I live with my friends. I come home crying almost every day, because something stupid happened between us, and he wanted to break up again. All my roommates are my close friends, and they all say they hate seeing me like this, and that I shouldn't have to put up with this, and that I deserve so much more. I know they're just looking out for me, but I feel they don't understand how much I want to be with this person. Lost and misunderstood, I stumbled upon I ching on a horoscope website. So this is the question I asked ""What can I expect for potential future of my relationship with my current boyfriend?""And this is the answer the I ching gave me. The primary hexagram is 23 (Splitting Apart) with changing lines 2 and 6, and the relating hexagram is 7 (The Army). The changing line 2 states that ""The bed is split at the edge, those who persevere are destroyed. Misfortune""I've read in the beginning book instruction that the changing lines represent what will happen in the future, with the first line being the near future and the top line being the distant future?Does that mean in the near future, something bad, as devastated as the first bad thing that happened to our relationship nearly a year ago, is about to happen again? And what does it mean by those who persevere are destroyed? Is that referring to me? since I keep hanging on to the relationship?Then the changing line of 6 states that ""There is a large fruit still uneaten. The superior man receives a carriage. The house of the inferior man is split apart.""What does that mean really? Overall, does it mean we're not meant to be, and there's nothing I can do to save the relationship, if I keep on hanging on then bad things will happen? and if the breakup happens, then I will be split apart emotionally?Please help me with this interpretation, I was devastated and lost all hopes in life the first time it happened, and I just get so sick thinking about the possibility of this breakup. Please please help me."
2512,Hi Everybody!I wanted to know if anyone could help me with interpreting this reading.Situation: I met X somewhere. I had a great time talking to her.               I made many more trips to the somewhere.               We seemed to get along well.                 One day I asked her if she had a boyfriend after                a friend I'll call Y insisted I should.                She said she did.                Then she told me she was moving.               After a couple of months Y saw her online.               Y likes to search the web.               I was super nervous at the time because she had a               boyfriend and               I don't normally do very well with web communication               but I really wanted to talk to her again.               It took me a few months to get up the nerve to               send her a message.               Then things went really well!               She sent one back and seemed               to be happy talking to me again.               I was super thrilled.               Then I got nervous because guess what?               I kept doing I ching readings about the relationship               like I was going to die tomorrow and I had to meet a quota or the world               would explode in giant fireball of cheese.:bag:               Naturally they seemed to get steadily worse.               (when I read them now I realize that they were actually pretty positive.)               X was pretty busy at the time. I decided in my extremely               clear state of mind that she was ignoring me.               Then I sent her a message. A week later she hadn't               replied. I thought I might have said something wrong.               Anyway this cycle repeated itself for about five weeks.               I was a bigger dummy back then.               Now X being busy got irritated and things started getting               worse from there. I got upset. Then I asked my friend Y for               some help.               Y is a very direct person with a bit of temper and               can really verbally hammer someone when angry.               The ironic thing is that I didn't want to write a message to X               because well... I thought I was to mad to do so.               I even said to Y that I didn't think the message was what               I wanted to say but Y told me it had to be sent and that it would               be fine.               Did I mention I was a bigger dummy back then?               Things just went downhill from there.               I didn't talk to X for a few months and X wasn't going to be talking to me.               I also deleted my profile.               Then one day for reasons I won't mention I realized I actually missed X.               This was about 3 months later.               I didn't want to send her a message because I was pretty sure               she hated my guts.               So I made a new profile.               I also avoided mentioning anything about knowing or meeting X               and decided I would just talk to her for as long as I could and               hope she wouldn't ask a lot of questions about me.               That's about it.               I know I shouldn't pretend to not know X but I don't               really have much of a choice. Question: What do I need to know about my relationship with x this month? Hexagram : 11 with the first line changing and turning into 46. I left out names and places and conversations because I couldn't bare to be any more open. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I'll give updates as the situation changes. Thanks for reading this post.
2513,"Hello... I wondered if anyone would give me some insight into my reading.I asked what does R feel towards X - I Ching advised 30.2 > 14.R is currently divorcing X, after a long separation instigated initially by X.

2514,"I'm wild with grief. My partner of 9 years left me this morning. As some may remember, we went through a big crisis last year, and had both agreed a new leaf was turned. But after coming back from another business trip, she acted strangely, and I felt a pit in my stomach, instinctively, like something was looming. I fell back into my old (and stupid! stupid!) routine of asking her for more attention, recriminating her for not being around enough, and demanding that she tell me whether she still loved me. So this morning she said the relationship was no longer working and the feelings just weren't there, factually, sadly, not in anger. Then she left. No word from her since. I'm beyond devastated, because I really thought we were going to make it, and before this business trip everything ""seemed"" good. And I feel like it's my fault. Plus the YI seemed to affirm this: when I drew the YI meditating on how heartbroken I feel, I received hexagram 56 twice: once with the second line which speaks of losing one's servant because of carelessness, and once with the 6th line changing (burning up the nest and losing one's cow). So I drove her away...but how can a relationship like ours prove so vaporous and fragile?Then I asked if there's anyway at all to salvage this, though I'm weary by now and feel I need to break out of this cycle of hope and heartbreak. I drew 35 unchanging (Progress). Have no idea what this could mean, and in any case I've decided hoping would be foolish at this point; she made it crystal clear that she's no longer in love with me. Finally asked the YI what I need to do going forward, as I can only live moment to moment right now: totally paralyzed and don't even know what to do. received 45, gathering together, lines 3, 5 and 6, changing to 56, once again (this showed up three times in one set of readings!) I find it so cruel and senseless, to have regained closeness and what I thought was mutual love, and then have it disentegrate like this. Maybe I did nag her too much. Maybe I was unbearable. But we have a 9-year history. I can't grasp what could make her want to throw that away.Thank you for listening...this is the darkest night I've had in a very long time. Very glad I found this community.Last edited: Jun 6, 2009"
2515,"I asked a general question""What do I need to know about my romantic relationship with X for this year 2009?""And the answer I got was hexagram 57 changing lines of 1,2,5,6 to relating hexagram 36Based on my little knowledge about interpretation, it seems 57 with line 1,2 sound good. I'm not sure how to read line 5 thoughAnd line 6 just altogether sounds so bad. Can someone help me with this line? Is the line saying that something I do will destroy the relationship I have, and however I think I am right, it wasn't a right thing to do? ""However firm and correct he may (try to) be, there will be evil.""Should I be worried and start panicking? Hehe, this is probably why I need help on the reading, because I think sometimes I'm biased, and since I've been going through such a hard period in life right now, I see everything as negative, and get really scared at even the slightest mention of ""evil"".Thanks for helping me again!"
2516,"I am really enjoying learning the i ching I have asked what is happening with me relationship with my partner ? I have received 3 chun with moving lines 9 and 6.We have been together six months I have felt emotions that I have not felt before he is very special and caring and loving. We are total opposites in most areas which has caused some getting used too but at the same time it is fun.I am concerned about moving line six at the top as it say's Horse and wagon part.Bloody tears flow.The difficulties at the beginning are too great for some persons. They get stuck and never find their way out; they fold their hands and give up the struggle. Such resignation is the saddest of all things. Therefore Confucius says of this line: ""Bloody tears flow: one should not persist in this.""Any input appreciated "

I know I should block him out - but he released something in me.. but maybe that was his function in my life, and a continued relation isn't possible or good for either.. Timed out in other words.Please help with these readings - which I will not share my thoughts on as I'd like a fresh take - short sharp shock - instant impressions.1. What can you tell me about why it is he inspires my emotions and a flow of thoughts?49.3 > 172. Is he emotionally involved with another? (and so gets nothing from my input/ friendship which would be long distance anyway)37.4 > 93. Is the 'treasure' in the previous answer elsewhere? (or reflecting back at my potential input)26.6 > 11I have started a letter to him, maybe I should just keep it as my own literary exercise - perhaps the real him has no bearing on my projection of what he means to me...4.

I don't want this friendship to die - though it has been dying and maybe I should let it - because I want to continue talking with someone I have felt a connection with, who has inspired me in some ways and has made me feel less weird in some aspects of my ways... but perhaps I've just been too deep for him and he is not that kind of person.:bows: "
2518,"Hello,I've recently reconnected with an old friend online. There was always a strong attraction between us, but never acted on. He lives in another country and is in a relationship. Through correspondence, talking and communicating online in the last four months, he has told me he has fallen in love with me again and has to see me, so he is coming for a visit. I've never entered into anything like this before. At first I found the whole situation bizarre, but there is an intellectual/sexual/spiritual attraction between us - there always was and it was grown through our communication. But I am wary and see this thing fraught with complexities and limitations. I consulted the I Ching and asked what can I expect if I pursue this relationship and I got 39 for the present and 31 for the future. Any views? "

2520,"dear all,I had a couple of readings I would like to share with you and ask for your insights . .Last night I asked Yi to comment on what is happening in my life -lately things are being moved inside big time, sometimes slowly and subtly, other times crashing and colliding (this last being a 14.6 according to Yi)the answer I got was 17.2,3 to 43at first I took that to mean I should keep an adult perspective, that the change was going from immature to mature (yes, yes  a choice in following )thing is, I am a firm believer of choices and decisions, only I feel genuine ones do not come by that often. I think that our authentic decisions come at critical points, are rare and deeply unsettling . . once they are made we just keep re-affirming them or deviating from them (which is more of an issue of consistency rather than decision-making) until there comes the time for another major shift, demanding a deeper evaluation hence a new decisionanyways, back to my reading . .in order to clarify my answer and verify my understanding of it, I asked two more questions:- show me an image of what do I need to let go of (17.2) Yi said 26.6 relating 11-show me an image of what do I need to keep and nourish (17.3)the answer came in 45.2,6 relating 6the meaning of 45/6 became quite clear to me after a while, but my 26.6 was a riddle . . what is given up in 26.6 and how does it relate to my small enthusiastic kid?so I tried digging this up a bit till it dawned on me and asked:-am I to keep both 17.2 and 17.3?-Yi: 49.4 to 63Yup, nothing is to be given up, only peeled, tamed and put into good use . . in fact i see now the two lines as merging into one . . no scission but integration . . not building up walls, but working along natural forces, harkening and steering where no blood is shed, in order to achieve the happy creative place of 11still 26.6 remains a riddle . . looked it up here but can't seem to find much informationI would honestly appreciate your insights, ideas and understandings of what this great yet mysterious guideline is telling me . . .:bows:rodaki"
2521,"Hi everyone and thanks to anyone who is taking the time to look at my thread.I just had a go at making an Iching reading and I got a primary hexagram of 52 and a relating hexagram of 57. There were moving lines at 2 and 5.My question was about the possibility of repairing a very damaged friendship with someone that I loved very much. Needless to say, my feelings weren't reciprocated and I cut myself off to try and cope, but I'm having some trouble moving on. When it happened I sent him an email about a year ago to try and explain the depth of my feelings for him and why I had to stop keeping in touch because I didn't want him to be hurt. He replied in a very cold way and basically said he was in love with someone else and I meant nothing to him. I'm not expecting the situation to change but I was hoping that if I got in touch again we might be able to part on kinder terms. I don't want to interfere in his life but I'm really sad that he seems to harbour ill feeling towards me. So would it be a mistake to seek a reconciliation?Any thoughts would be gratefully received as I am a complete amateur at this.Thank youMoblyxxx"

2527,"Dear Clarity friendsI've had a bad day today. It started with lack of sleep (3 hours, couldn't go back to sleep when I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night). Went to work and so far a chain of events have happened, perhaps not so serious, but it has been one of these days, you know, when every little thing goes wrong. I have been edgy and exhausted.The thing is that I've been edgy and exhausted for some time now. I have problems in every single area of my life. OK, nothing tragic is going on but, to give an example, I've been very stressed at work lately because of the amount of work that has been loaded on my shoulders and the whole work environment, which is not conducive to getting a job well done. There are loads of things that I have to do at work that I don't have the time or the energy to do and that I leave for the next day, and then the next day and so on. Outside of work, there are things I have to do that I don't have the energy to do (sometimes not even the time) and that I leave for the following day and you know how the story goes. I mean I don't even bother to do some practical things to get some money I'm being owed from different sources. In the last few days even my house is in complete disorder. It's not only work; it's everything. I feel that my whole life is in disarray. And today I feel this even more. I realize that lack of sleep has made me edgier than usual but this is a situation that cannot go on (a 28 situation?). So I briefly stated the situation to the Yi, not posing any specific question. And I got hex 11.1,4,5,6 > 44.I have to admit that I haven't made much effort to understand the answer in some depth. My understanding is that an 11 situation is what I should be aiming to achieve, perhaps some kind of harmony or equilibrium which is now lacking (I'd like to think the answer leans towards the predictive but I think, in this case, the Yi is making clear to me what my aim should be and how to achieve it). Then it gives specific advice to help clarify the situation. There are too many moving lines and I tend to look at every single changing line, no matter how many I get. I'll have to do the work to understand what the Yi is telling me about the specifics of the situation with each moving line. As for line 6, I've had a stark experience with this line once, and I would like to think that this line is just describing what happened  today or what happens from time to time, when things go wrong and you can't really to anything to stop this chain of events. The reason I'm asking for some help here is that I have the feeling that the Image of hex  11 is what will be particularly helpful to me now in order to start creating some order out of this mess. I'd probably get most things back in line sooner or later anyway, but why diss the lovely advice when it is there staring me in the eye?  So I'd appreciate any thoughts on how the Image especially applies to combating chaos or    disarray in one's life. Where do I start, or how do I go about it?Sorry for the long post.el_2"
2528,"hello there,I'm facing what could be a difficult decision. I've been itching to move on from my full time job for some time now as it doesn't correspond to my own values, as I've previously talked about on this forum. I'm being offered a very different kind of job that would be for a year, perhaps two, and allow me to both get back to teaching, and provide lots of free time to pursue my creative projects and freelance work, which have been taking on more importance in my life. The only problem is that with the financial crisis, I'm worried anout leaving my steady job with decent pay for a job that will last two years at most and pays a bit less. some people are telling me I'm crazy for even considering it, but something feels right about making this jump. I still enjoy my full time job but I'm starting to feel myself detach from it, prepared to move on to horizons that suit me better, even if it means a bit more instability. I asked the Yi whether accepting this new job would be positive for me, and got 48, The Well, with lines 1,5,6 changing, to hexagram 26.Then I asked if I would regret taking this new job or if I could trust my desire for change and growth, and got 28.5 changing to 32. This seems less encouraging than the first reading.Finally, I asked, ""Overall, would it be favorable or unfavorable for me to accept this job""? > Got 62, changing line 5, to 31, influence.Hmm, I really don't know what to think of all this...any suggestions more than welcome!"
2529,"Hi everyone, i consulted the i ching several weeks ago regarding my pregnancy.I asked it if i would have a successful pregnancy.Anyway, i got hexagram #19 with the bottom line and third line changing which resulted in hexagram #46.Now, can someone please explain what this means because all i am focusing on is hexagram #19 and the text that says ""when the eighth month comes there will be misfortune"" Now i am terrified that something is going to go wrong with my pregnancy in the 8th month.Does the first hexagram count or should i be focussing on the 2nd hexagram i recieved?I am still a learner with the i ching, as you can probably guess.Thank you"
2530,"Some weeks ago I opened a new site about the spherical arrangement of the hexagrams (the Yi-globe), and soon after Luis made a reference to it in the 'I Ching News'. After having found the Clarity's site and having acquainted myself with the activity of this community, I joined as a friend with pleasure. Thus I have become a member of the 'I Ching Community'. :bows:The joining to the ICC recalled to my mind a divination that I made ten years ago. At that time the Yi-globe had been reconstructed already but it was an empty form, devoid of content. I did not know, how and where I should go on, would be any sense in the further work. Then I turned to the I Ching for advice.The question was: Are my insights correct regarding the system of the hexagrams? Can spiritual values be derived from my efforts of dealing with this subject further on?The answer obtained was the Creative (hexagram 1), with the 9 in the 2nd place. Thus, the expected future was Fellowship with Men (hexagram 13).The answer was not simply surprising but shocking for me. I felt as if a spirit or the Book itself had appeared, as if a supreme power had touched me then. I do not want to interpret the first part of this oracle here. In short, I took it highly favorable and promising for the future. I contemplated on the subject, got new ideas, wrote a book (in Hungarian, in 2005), and made a website (in English, 2009).The most curious thing is, however, the predicted future, hexagram 13: Fellowship with Men. Its judgment: 'Fellowship with men in the open. Success. It furthers one to cross the great water.' Is it possible, that the oracle will be fulfilled here and now, in the I Ching Community? Apparently, it has to be the best place to find the fellowship with other persons.And what may be the explanation for 'in the open' (in other translations: in the wilds, in the country, etc.)? Would be the newest variant 'on the internet'? What is your opinion?Please, further my 'crossing the great water'Joe"

I have spent the past 3.5 years recovering from a 51 type situation with a guy who I believed was my equal, my soulmate, my dream guy, ""the one"" - and I only knew him briefly. The impact of our meeting and ensuing events have had such a profound impact on me and my life that I've been waiting to wake up and have it all click i.e. that he would come back into my life or that there was a lesson to learn of huge importance, or that I'd meet someone else and laugh it all off as one of those moments in life....While there have been many lessons I've learned through this situation, the biggest is that it's all within me to learn from this and be free of it and that this situation is just a catalyst for my fears and insecurities and other issues. I have recently gone through some emotional freedom technique therapy which has really helped. But despite the great progress and feeling like I've landed in a really good place with positive things ahead, I still have such degradingly down moments about that past situation and then it affects how i feel about the rest of my life which I hate so much because I really like my life at the moment! These moments can get so bad that they devastate me. I realise this is part of the healing process but I am desperate for all of this to end. I've had enough! I feel this burden has overstayed its welcome big time!!

2539,"Hello everyone,does 64 to 13 bode well for the potential of (a new, not yet established) relationship?I see it as a positive sign which warns against being reckless and ruining things by being impatient and trying to rush things before they're ripe. The 64 ends with the bright line 5: ""The victory has been won. Everything has gone well. All misgivings have been overcome.  The new time has arrived, and with it good fortune (...) the new era appears all the more glorious by contrast with the misery of the old.""But since there are four changing lines, I am not shour how(if) to regard 13.4.6 as well. And they do not seem so positive. The 13 itself seems promissing, taling about fellowship and ""peaceful union of men"" and ""organic organisation within diversity"". The two individuals in question are from different countries so I see that as the ""diversity"" which is to be organised.The non changing lines, however, speak of ""dividing walls which cannot be overcome"" (4)and about ""being outside of fellowship with others"" (6). It also says that ""the fellowship includes only those who happen to dwell near one another.""Seems contradictory to the positive note the 64.5 ends with...Thank you for the insights."
2540,"I asked the I Ching about a certain person in my life right now trying to get a better picture of their place in our life. I am pretty confused about how I feel about this person but there is a kind of ""fit"" with us.  I asked ""Why is A right for me?"" 35.4.6 to 2A bit one sided but the other side is clearer to me.  I think the I Ching is telling me to wait to see what develops.I am trying to get over someone that I haven't seen or spoke to n months that it seems I am not supposed to be with.  I asked the I Ching ""Why isn't B right for me?"" 21.1.2 to 64  It seems the answer has a lot to do with justice.About a week later I was lying in bed and this person's name suddenly popped into my head and in the accompanying feeling of urgency I asked ""What does B want to tell me or want me to know?"" 64.5.6 to 47.Thanks for the help."
2541,"Good morning everyone, I did a reading asking the I ching if i should just up and quit my job. I have no back up plan, would just live off my savings while searching for something else. However, I feel i have reached the point where i just cannot take it anymore and everyday is agony to come in.The response I got from the I ching was 38.3 changing to 14my first thought was this is a clear sign that I should quit because I read it as saying I should ""cleave"" to what I feel is right which will ultimately lead to a better situation (hex 14) but...then I came across a transaltion of this line which basically stated I should just deal with it. This is part of what that transaltion said:""So whether enduring a punishment/reprimand oneself or watching another person in distress, one should not get carried away. This is a just a passing event and is not to be regarded as anything more than a temporary estrangement. There is hope of better times ahead.""Now I'm thinking the reading is saying I am in possesion of a job and should just deal with it! anyone have any experience with this line in regards to work issues? or any ideas on how I should be reading this would be much appreciated!"
2542,"Water or Fire? My mutlimedia firm, Gnosis Arts, has been planning to start a Summer internship program. We've located the student and identified the Unversity and have a rough outline of the job description. But because we are still small, we cannot pay the intern a salary, but we can offer a small stipend. As with any business expense, the stipend must be justified. In addition, the time I as the director will have to spend training and managing has to be taken into account. Even though I like the idea of the internship, I'm having second thoughts as I think about the money and time expenditures involved.I asked the I Ching, ""What will be the effect of hiring this intern?"" The answer I received was Joyous, Lake over Lake. Then, I asked the reverse question, ""What will be the effect of not hiring the intern?"" and the answer was Clinging, Flame over Flame.The first hexagram had no change. As a general rule, this means the answer is fixed, unequivocal. But the second hexagram had quite a bit of change, meaning that this path involves less certainty, more volatility, and more complexity.Water or Fire?What I found most interesting about these two hexagrams is the natural symbols represented by them. In the first instance, Lake is doubled, i.e., a water sign (to borrow from the Zodiac philosophy). In the second, Fire is doubled, i.e., a fire sign. Fire and water typically don't mix. Fire is also a symbol of illumination or enlightenment. Fire also tends to possess more Yang energy. Water, on the other hand, is often spoken of in Taoist texts as the paradigmatic element for Yin energy. The person of superior character - who stays aligned with the Tao - is often described as being ""like water."" Perhaps the I Ching is saying that hiring the intern is more in harmony with Tao. What do you think?"

I know a lot of new people have moved into my building but due to my schedule I never see them, but I am seriously wondering if one of the newbies has stolen it!I don't want to go accusing someone of theiving and I can't imagine the type of person who would steal from one's neighbor, but i don't know what else could have happened.I asked the I Ching, ""was my package stolen?""the response: 42.1.3.5 > 52line 3 seems to definately suggest I have in fact been robbed and to report it to the proper authorities but lines 1 and 5 have me scratching my head  what exactly are they telling me in this case? i'm not really sure how 52 applies either.

A year ago , pondering on whether I will say yes to a cooperation with some people, although everything looked  perfect I had a hunch that something wasn’t as it looked.  I throw the coins and Yi, although I had neglected it for years * blush*, was kind enough to give me 8.3. Time show that this hunch was correct and it safe me from lots of troubles.  That was the phase II of the relationship between Yi and me. End of introduction… Somedays ago, Yi gave me 20.3.4 >33 as an answer to a question regarding a friend of mine and his attitude. BTW, the question was “why he behaves to me like that”. He is almost rude, something that is new to me. He has his tempers sometimes ( a bit more than an average person) but now is something else. One day he is sweet and caring and the next grumpy. I care a lot about him and I have asked him ( more than once) if his has personal problems, or if I have done something wrong and offend him. He said no. His behavior is very confusing and sometimes makes me mad, but I try keep my anger. One of us must be calm, I thinkI struggle to understand Yi’s reply, but haven’t understand it yet. Line 20.3 makes sense “Decides the choice. Between advance and retreat”. Those changes in his mood looks like advancing and retreat. Probably something concerns him and he is not ready to talk or he doesn’t want On the other hand , line 20.4 makes not sense at all. Hexagram 33, might say that there is something “threatening and he tries to protect him from that.  Could be me or something else, I have no clue .I also asked “what is the best approach I should follow”56.1.3  to 21 .56.1 A wanderer should not demean himself. Well, maybe I do that. ( I call it patience)56.3 : I feel like a stranger in his land, this is true. Could it be that it shouldn’t concern me because I harm my self. ?Relating hexagram 21 : could it be that I should be less passive/patient and try to bite through. Have a open discussion and express my feeling and how his behavior hurts me ? Maybe it is irrelevant, but his behavior became worse, after I told him that I’m in an affair. There is not a romantic relationship between me and my friend, we are strictly friends but there is a coincidence that I can’t explain.If there is anything you can say that might clarify my readings please do. Feel free to point any mistakes you see in my interpretationMany thanksMalena"
2548,"Hi All,I have been in contact with somebody for about a year and a half with gaps mostly via email and text. She has just ended a 10 year relationship (I think the whole thing started during an initial breakup but I dont know for sure)- shes 24 and we've been out twice since she ended her relationship in couples therapy. I know theres at least one other guy around but I think strong feelings exist between us. I am interested in a relationship eventually ideally but given the circumstances... So I asked the I-Ching yesterday:What is her position? 63.4 -> 49What is my position? 63.4 -> 49What is our position? 18.2 -> 52And today I asked:An image showing the possibility of anything serious between us? 48.3.4.5.6 -> 64Any thoughts or advice? I think maybe 48 -> 64 bodes well but overall it seems precarious with perceptible potential according to these readings. Any other perspectives, advice or testimonials are definitely appreciated. Thanks All"

2550,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could give some feedback on 41 - Decrease line 6 changing to 19 - Advance.My 10 months relationship wasn't going so well a couple of weeks ago we broke up (my initiative). About 10 days later I tried to go back (over the phone, she didn't want to see me) but she said that despite being really sad and not being able to imagine herself without me, she couldn't imagine herself with me either, maybe in a couple of weeks she would feel differently.... I have not contacted her since, another 10 days have passed no word from her either. Knowing that it is difficult to ask the I ching questions related to time like ""how long"". My question was:""Will we meet before we become totally strangers as a couple?( before nothing of our romance is left)"" I read here the forums about these hexagrams and line and I can quite understand it, but not sure how it would apply to my particular question...Any input would be greatly appreciated! Many thanks in advance to all. "

2552,"Hi there,Having decided to expand my social life to involve new friends - which is arguably difficult considering the shifts I work - I decided to ask ""what are my best options for making new friends?"" I want to point out that I do socialise with good friends with whom I do share common interests, but lately I am feeling the need to encompass a broader perspective on all things, and involve myself with, I don't know, just some new outlooks on life also.  For some reason, it's important for me to do so, and I have been feeling this way for some time.Well.  Somehow I managed hexagram 10, (lines 3 & 4 if I've got it right )- changing to hexagram 9.  Not being particularly adept at reading at this stage - being new to the I-Ching - it seemed like quite a heavy sort of answer for something I had envisioned as being reasonably straightforward and matter of fact!  I'd really appreciate some angles on this from you folks, thank you.cheers, kiwigal"
2553,I don't get it and I've looked at numerous interpretations.  I asked the Ching what my ex wants with me. I saw him last night at a music event but we didn't talk or anything and I'm not even sure he saw me.
2554,"I am having a lot of trouble in my love life and have been for a while so I asked the I Ching ""What is the best I can hope for with A?"" and got 54.2.3.4 to 36.I also asked ""What is the proper action to take with A now that will help me find my true path?"" I got 56.4 to 52I also asked ""What is the (a) reality about me and A that I need to acknowledge and accept?"" I got 15.3 to 2The last reading I did about this person was ""Please describe for me what path I will go down if I commit myself to A."" and got 63.1.2.5 to 15I am not currently with this person but the doors are open on both sides although there are outside complications to it.These complications have really effected me and I am worried about where I am headed because of the pressures I'm under so I asked the I Ching ""How can I prevent myself from turning into the lonely and negative person that I feel I am becoming?"" and I received 5.5 to 11.Then I asked ""Please show me the place assigned for me by heaven"" since hex 5 mentions this. I got 48.2 to 39    *great :SAny input on any of these readings is greatly appreciated.  Thank you."
2555,"Hi again I recently came across a pic online, of a guy I had a very brief relationship with last year. I was surprised it sparked such an emotion in me. I liked him a lot and there was a seemingly strong connection, but it was bad timing for both of us and I felt he changed his attitude towards me when he found out I was 7 years older than him (he originally thought I was younger than him). He acted pretty immaturely too, so it kind of ended with a silly argument and that was that. So it was a pretty easy ""let-go"" on my part (and I believe on his too because I was older and because he had just ended a long term relationship and was still getting over it and was loving his freedom etc). I didn't think much about him after that because he said he was going back home (overseas) at the end of the year for good, so that pretty much put a stop on any thoughts of a relationship for me in the first place....But I know he felt torn between his real home and his home here in Australia (of 8 years) so I wasn't surprised when I saw this pic of him at a local event here.......he's obviously back after a visit home for christmas! Triggered by my emotional response (warm and somewhat excited) to him being back in Australia and seeing his pic I asked the IC ""Does D think about me any more?"" and I got 55.1.5 > 31Line 1 talks about a time of abundance and Two individuals possessed of these two attributes are suited to each other, and.....""even if they spend an entire cycle of time together during the period of abundance, it will not be too long, nor is it a mistake. Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one's influence felt; it will meet with recognition""Line 5 talks about good fortune31 talks about influence and wooing.Could this mean he is thinking about me, or am i reading this completely wrong!thankssofia :bows:"
2556,"Hi again my recent moon-sign based horoscope (based on my exact time/date of birth) advised that opportunity was in the air for me these coming weeks and that this will come about in various forms with little opportunities here and there that may lead to what I really really want, but in a round about way (as opposed to a direct knock on the door). And that I had pick the ones that were the best choice i.e. be a bit strategic, since they weren't necessarily going to be the options that I most directly desired.So I asked the IC ""What signs do I need to look out for with regard to any positive opportunities these coming weeks?"" and I received 23.2.3 > 18Sounds like splitting apart from danger or an enemy situation and then finding new opportunities as a result of that - but I don't feel there's any danger or enemy I need to get rid of, except some old ill notions of past affairs, which I've been getting rid of anyway through some therapy and I'm feeling really centred about - which then made me think the opportunities may come from or be related to my past....So I asked the IC ""Will these opportunities come from someone or something from my past?"" and I received 41 unchanging.....which confuses me. Does this mean yes or no? Thank you to anyone who can help clarify these readingssofia :bows:"
2557,"I'd like to ask a question but I am not sure how to phrase it. My father and his wife Joan are signed up to move into a senior residence. They have been on the waiting list for a year but now that a room has finally became available my dad doesn't want to go. I do not live close by so I don't know all the ins and outs but the way I see it is that.. 1) Joan put a great deal of time and effort into finding a good place for them and Dad barely participated in the search. Dad should move because he's known for over a year this was the plan and it's not right to now act as though this is a big surprise. Furthermore they NEED to move. Dad is 90. They live on the side of a hill and their house has 100 steps to the front door, they have both had falls and broken bones, Joan doesn't want to cook anymore etc. 2) On the other hand, I can understand from an astrological point of view why energies are stalled.. Dad is a Capricorn and Saturn has been retrograde this past several months indicating a time of backing up from making commitments. Further, Mercury is retrograde until the first of June. So perhaps it really has been for the best they not have moved already. But what about now? Saturn has turned direct this last weekend so it's time to start moving ahead, but in what direction?Okay, having thought this through I now am going to ask the I Ching, ""Where should they go from here, where is the path opening up for them now?"" I am not in a position to advise them but I would like to understand what their best direction is so I can recognize what is evolving and thus be able to encourage the flow.I'll be right back..Last edited: May 21, 2009"
2558,"Ok, so here I am: a few weeks ago, I asked about reconnecting with someone whom I’ve “lost” several months ago. I’ve followed IC advice (59>17), made contact, got the reply.Now I’m in a vacuum, without patience, a bit restless, curious about what the future holds. I asked how the things will develop and got 18 > 17As I see 18, it completely fits the situation: I’ve let things decay, I did not nurture the connection and it got “lost”. Now I’ve decided to “get back on track” to mend what has decayed, to try to focus again, to get back on the path. However, the hex 18 is completely changing to 17 (which indicates future, as I see it) and then I am not sure what it is all about.The way I see it is that though I am back on the right (?) path I cannot expect to make the other person to just follow me in whatever I want (or how fast I want it to be) but I have to wait for “the following” to come naturally on its own. I have to be firm in patience and adapt to the circumstances/time/tempo, to pace myself.Am I anywhere close to the proper reading? And, does this 17 imply positive development or does it just say “sit and wait it out, and just accept whatever happens”?Thank you very much for your help."
2559,"Hi all,Having problems with knowing my direction and abilities, and expressing myself day to day. Been doing a lot of reading and trying to brush up on my knowledge recently. Want to write my own stuff but invariably getting distracted.. I know self discipline is what's needed. As a result I do feel quite worn out.  I received 60.6 in response to my asking why my head is spinning before trying to sleep etc.. I think perhaps I'm taking too much in and lacking a sense of fun or personal outlet at the mo.. I asked How can I improve my thinking?Hex 60Talks about the importance of not being excessive ; 'Neither reaching too high nor leaving your potential unrealised'.So keeping things in proportion - again perhaps I'm trying to hard to 'be something' without having firstly discerned what I'm aiming for... demanding too much of my brain (which I suppose I have been feeling quite critical of recently A while ago I asked where I should take my writing?I received 63.1,5 > 6I interpreted this as saying I need to decide my objectives (remove inner conflict) and check my course before proceeding. 63.5 says> 'Consider whether you could achieve a far greater result with fewer resources'I probably just need to sit in a quiet room free of distractions and allow inspiration to find me... allow the opportunity for a flow of consciousness. Commit to the idea that there is also a voice in me... Prioritise attempting the journey.. just do it decisively free of expectation and self criticism? And perhaps with a thought of the greater good - how I could help others etc.. art must be Universal after all.. So perhaps I need to detach from myself and my conflicts first?I also asked How do I realise my full potential (described in hex 60)?21.3 > 30Could this be saying I need to bite through my poisoned emotions first? Or perhaps not take in so much what others have written, or what others do, in order to find my own voice?Any advice on these issues would be most welcomed. I know it is essentially a matter of self discipline, calming down and dedication minus distractions.. but emotionally I am not currently all that happy which also makes it hard to concentrate when I'm aware of a certain emptiness, which I know I just need to try to let go of, but it isn't that easy.. Though I am grateful for the things that are going well in one area of my life, my personal life doesn't feel quite so optimal... I guess it's always a case of what goes up in one aspect of your life, tends not to match up in another area (like a see-saw...) Nothing's ever 100% perfect and I guess it's about seeing the beauty of that - accepting and moving with the good and bad flows of life.. inevitably subject to change. Keeping calm within when there's chaos without.. although chaos within is harder to rise above it seems...:bows:"
2560,"I asked What is the workable key to unlocking some sense of self-contentment?40.1,2,4 > 24I think it's saying I need to let go of negative, familiar patterns and take advantage of what's being offered (40.2) and perhaps become more independent? (40.4) I am currently living at home so am possibly not being challenged enough and too reliant on family (nice for a re-coup but probably not good for regaining confidence after a while.. lack of challenges and stimulation I guess...)24 suggests a new cycle that I need to be prepared for? A re-grouping of what I'm aiming for in my future? (rather than dwelling on the past) Re-discovery of a new self? That I should liberate myself from my past self? Insight would be welcome but I do think I'm pretty clear on the reading.. :bows:"

2562,"Hi ya'llWould firstly like to say a big thank you for all your insights.  I have found this site really helpful while trying to gain 'clarity' with some recent situations in my life.Right now though I have something going on which is totally out of my remit.  This is a work question.  I'm in a bit of bother with my superior and I've been foolishly trying to upwardly manage.  The situation has now got me into hot water and because of my frankness to our working relationship my superior wants to put me through a disciplinary based on the way I spoke and it not being appropriate.  This is even though I was trying to come from a good place, get our working relationship stronger and thus make my boss' job easier.  Its only had the reverse effect though.  It might help to add that my boss is very old school, timid and gentle where as I'm completely the opposite.  I'm very open about my feelings.  I am able to totally keep my emotions in check but I just think I've pushed things a little too far this time.  I've been clear that I've taken on board all her comments... I understand my boundaries now and have tried to assure her that we can work through this.  However she does still seem strongly to want to go through with this.  I've asked her to reconsider, that it could be disastrous for our future working relationship, but I don't think she will. It seems so unreasonable and drastic for her to go to these lengths. I'd understand if we had already had the discussion and she felt I was still doing it... but hey ho - perhaps this is my lesson that I have to take... I can't change people - only myself.Admittedly  I've gone a bit crazy with the questions for the Ching and have been asking them from my bosses point of view as well as from my own.  I've just confused myself and was hoping that one of you fine folk could add some clarity to my situation.The questions i've asked are as follows:What's going on!?  Why is she not wanting to work at this? 57.1.3.4 > 10Will she go through with it? (I've asked her to re-consider) 34.3.5 > 58What should I do? (should I give as good as I get) 62.1 > 55So should I take next week off until my colleague returns? 21.1.6 . 16Sorry to bombard... any clarity would be gratefully received.Thanks and big love"
2563,"This is my first post--I'm really a beginner at this.Last year, I had an intense but non-physical flirtation with someone who was, at the time, in a relationship with someone else (they've since split up). Since then, he left my town for career reasons and I haven't seen him since. I will be seeing him again soon and asked the yi if there was anything I needed to know about the encounter, receiving 20.5>23.He is a very self confident ""alpha"" man, accustomed to compliments and general admiration--our flirtation mainly stemmed from the fact that I was never particularly impressed by him and he tried to win me over. But there was some real connection, especially towards the end--I softened and he stopped strutting about quite as much.How do I interpret this?"

We supported him emotionally and about practical things, something that others didn’t like. I’m worried about the times we have to be all together and I felt I needed some guidance from Yi. The only question I could form was “Now what ?” ( in the back of my mind was how to handle those meetings and the funeral) and I got 56.3.4.6 > 2I can’t see clearly .

2567,"So we have not spoken in over a year. He is now coming to where I am at, but I have still not heard from him. So I asked the I-Ching for some insight, as to whether he will actually set up a meeting or contact with me when he gets back. It says 40.1.2.6>21.I'm not sure what 21 means? It seems to involve some justice and/or punishment. Am not sure how it relates. Does it mean a decisive action?40.1: Deliverance has come. Does it mean he will contact? He may not have intended contact so am not sure what it means.40.2: Killing the fox and receiving a golden arrow.40.6: Success. But I do not understand the allegory of killing the hawk on the high wall. What does the hawk actually refer to? The hexagrams seem very violent, and am not sure how to interpret it. Is it a fight against the stalemate - indecision, or something else?Any insight on this is appreciated. "
2568,"Hi dear i-ching community,a colleague and I are organizing a major academic event.

I am extremely sorry this is happening and I am doing everything to get things to take their normal course. I asked the Yi: What will the repercussions of this ""faux pas"" be?The answer: 31, w. lines 4 and 5 changing, going to 15.What do you make of this?I am under the impression that things may indeed subside and take their course. I really hope it won't do too much damage to my colleague's and mine image. We are very enthused and I feel I have a lot to give.

2570,"I have been feeling bloated/ heavy in the stomach area recently which has led me to read a book on Chinese medicine - learning about hot/cold foods and sweet/ sour etc and the need for balance!  I have a major sweet tooth (always have had) which is linked to a depleted spleen/stomach if you have too much.  This can cause a spleen Qi deficiency which is also linked to over-thinking and depression!So I am trying to reduce sweet intake (though not completely of course - always need balance! and chocolate...) and also take on board the advice to eat until 75% full (rather than full - full which I probably am quite guilty of - I like my food, but afterward often feel uncomfortable - which is also not good for a refreshing sleep!)Anyway, for quite a while now my digestive system has been unstable and as I said have felt weird in the stomach these past few days (could also be dampness/ weather - when the sky is full of clouds I often feel tense and oppressed and just wish it to rain! and damp conditions are linked to inner dampness which disrupts Qi energy...)I asked What should I do to improve my digestion?11.2,3,5,6 > 42Echoing Chinese medicine advice (of course stands to reason) I read this as saying to balance the food I intake and 42 as saying I must allow my stomach to be decreased before I can bring it increase again i.e. let myself get hungry before eating again!  Eating is a cycle - you must give fullness and emptiness a chance!

It seems to be suggesting I should go ahead and take the plunge and choose someone, but I don't see anything that gives me a clue as to what qualities I should be looking for or which one to choose.I then asked about one of the potential roommates, ""What would it be like to live with H?"" and received 34 unchanging.

2574,"Hi,I'm going through a challenging period at the moment, friendships ending and still trying to find space to create my new business that would allow me to have the life I really want.  I had stepped off the career ladder for a while to focus on this but it was a struggle so I decided to take freelance work to help me get back on my feet financially.  Well I got a good contract with a company I liked and all seemed to be going good.  Its not my hearts desire but they like me and want to work long term with me and I made a commitment to do the work to the best of my ability for the next year as a stepping to where I really want to go.  Part of the work I'm doing is contracted out to another company who will pay CompanyX, who I work for.  CompanyX asked me to send in my contract and promised I'd be paid on a certain date.  That date came and went and the money wasn't paid.  When I asked about it they said I'd have to wait until they got paid from the the other company.  It's left me in a very difficult position financially but there's nothing I can do but wait and it could be another month before the money comes in.  The job is also demanding and its taking all my creative time so my hopes to continue developing my business on the side has gone out the window.  Life at the moment feels challenging and I'm wondering how I can find my way through this.  I ask Yi, a number of questions and hope you can follow the narrative and give me some feedback.1. What am I meant to learn from this period in my life?     11.3>192. How does working with companyX fit into this?  36.1.3>23.

What if I stay with companyX, where will that lead me?    50.4>18I'd really appreciate some guidance on this as part of me feels to leave once I've got paid (I'll have enough to get by for 4 months) reclaim my creative time and trust that in taking action to bring my business into being the way will open."

The result was Hex 19 with a 6 in the fourth lane. This changes to peace, which is not so important now since I understand it's my future. What makes me think is if I have to reach to her or if I should simply leave things to come in a natural way. I would sure appreciate anyone that has an idea of what this can mean and what I should do.Thank you!"
2577,"Hello everyone,I have stumbled upon this web site and community board while I was searching for interpretation of I Ching hexagram online. I'm a fresh learner and although this is a bit embarrassing, I got my I Ching hexagrams online....and although the web site provided me some basic meaning, I'd love to know more...if anyone out there is kind enough to jump inMy question: What's my prospect of finding love this year?It's very simple and I've been single for several years now. I'm just curious I got Hexagram 17 - Following (and web site said my first changing line is line 2, second is line 3)Then it changes to Hexagram 43 - Break Through, Resolute, Determination (?)Any advice and help on interpretation will be very appreciated. Thank you."
2578,"Hi there,Just new to this, and having difficulty with the interpretation.  The question being 'what are his feelings for me?' About a man I met 3 months ago and who is a teacher in the organisation I am doing night-classes in.  We are both adults, and I have to say I have never felt like this about any man before, i.e completely swept off my feet.  I have a different teacher this term, which is just as well, since I doubt I could have held myself together if I had been in his class this term. He is a lot younger than me, and a different nationality also.  And he seemed interested in me. So hexagram 31, with those changing lines into 24.  Any ideas?  I would appreciate some help with this, thank you. cheers, kiwigal"
2579,"Hi all,There is a event and thinking of attending. Really don’t have spare time and it requires a lot of arrangements to make it. But being there, will help me to do some connections with people I need their help for a certain project. So  I asked.What will I gain  If I go ? 62 unchangingSays not to have great expectations , I think. What will be the loss if I don’t go ? 19.5 > 60I guess its says I’ll lose a change to establish a connection with those people. What do you think ?ThanksMaria"
2580,"Hi guys,Following on from my recent posting about finding a peaceful life for me and my son (hex 18.2.4 to 56) and the comments and suggestions on the thread I wanted to clarify how do I actually break free from my current situation (i.e. by dealing with my internal reservations and blockages or by actually standing firm in what I believe is right and finally walking away from the relationship for good).  I got a hexagram 19, unchanging.I am puzzled by the comments regarding the eighth month, especially so since my secret deepest hope was to actually be able to move further out and create a physicall distance between me and my ex partner. My work contract ends in August (eighth month!), which would mean I would be able to move on then, find a new job and even relocate with my son somewhere where we could rebuild our lives. So what does ""reaching an end in the eighth month means a pitfall"" mean?  Does it mean that if I wait until August to resolve the situation, I will not succeed?  Or am I taking it too literally?  Apparently ""to receive hexagram 19 with no moving lines is unusually auspicious. It means there is no pitfall of the eighth month anywhere in sight"", but auspicious in resolving it in what way??This is just too confusing. Help!"
2581,"  Hi!I had found Hilary's very interesting text:'The I Ching brings that fresh perspective, and with it can come a sense of a calling. One of the most important questions you can ask it is ‘Please, show me something of who I truly am…’ so I have asked myself this question wanting to get some fresh perspective about who i could be (i guess I Ching shows the image most appropriate to the moment or to what one must learn in his life situation for the time being..)and the answer is hex. 39- Obstruction(Facing Obstruction)what does it mean regarding my question?(Hillary' s article 'Self-Development with the I Ching)I read different interpretations to this hexagram but i think i'm missing something (from my too personal...and narrow point of view as hex.39 keeps telling)(about me specifically:  concerned about self-improvement/individuation and buddhism , read books about these)thanks a lot to you! any answer will be very useful to me!"
2582,"I've had a reading that's intriguing but a little enigmatic: I asked what I needed to do to develop myself into the kind of writer I want to become, and also to start doing the kinds of reporting that really matters to me (I'm a journalist). I received hexagram 37, The Family, with no changing lines. Aside from one bit that keeps echoing in my head: ""Thus the superior man has substance in his words and duration in his way of life,"" which makes me think the reading is counseling persistence and digging deeply rather than just scratching the surface with my writing, I'm not sure what this is counseling. Support systems? Ordering my life in a more disciplined way to make more time for writing?Any ideas would be very much appreciated..."

2584,"Hi everyone,Out of complete frustration with my life, I asked the iching ""what is my purpose for being on the planet?""  I got 52 unchanging.  I was pretty thrilled, because I feel I was meant to be somewhat of a hermit, being alone and quiet.  My problem is everything in my life goes against this principle of keeping still.  At my job, I am forced to deal with the public (which I hate) while trying to do other work.  At home I live with two family members and others frequently drop in so I only get privacy in the bathroom or when I go to bed.  Every time I try to arrange or change my circumstances to get more time alone to keep still, I meet with resistance and I fail.  So I asked the iching how do I achieve 52 and I got 33.1.3.4.5.6 > 24, Retreat and Return.  This is pretty depressing to me, since I have been retreating for years, so much so, that I feel like a doormat, people just dump on me because I take it, but I try to make the best of it and start to practice positive intentions; focusing on the results I want, peace, prosperity, good health, etc.  Well, my outer circumstances get worse!  Work gets more hectic, more problems at home.  So I ask the iching why does it seem that my life is all about me losing and I get 9.2.5 > 22.  Here we go again!  I then asked what is restraing me and I got 2.5 > 8.I am so depressed by my circumstances, and by the message I perceive that I am stuck in a bad situation and there is nothing I can do,that I cannot comprehend what I am supposed to do.  Please help!"
2585,"I recently have been working on getting past a relationship; to the best of my efforts ( thinking on it, working through it, considering contact) I'm not certain, as it still remains on my mind. I asked the i ching - this ended badly - what is my responsibility towards fixing this, and is it worth my while? I always ask about my best/highest good and here's what i got 54-64It seems that it is done, and that as a whole, I need to let go of this - do i have this right? Clarification would be great - thanks."

2587,"Hello I'm rather new at postings, though I read the threads on this site often and I really appreciate everybody's insightful participation.   Well, I did something very out of character and borrowed a large sum of money to a very good old friend of mine.  Not that it's out of my character to help my friends out, but this is a very large amount of money for me.  I only agreed to do it because she told me that she would only need it for about 24 hours.  She needed to close an agreement with a property she was purchasing and that she would have had to make a long drive to receive the payment that she needed to do so.     Yeah..  I know it sounds sketchy, but I agreed to give her the money.  Now five days have passed and she has not returned the money yet.   For her this is an investment that she will benefit from hopefully.  I'm sure I will eventually get my money(I mean it does look like that from the hexagram, no?)  but I feel like I have been misled and manipulated into giving her a mortgage loan with no gratuity for me.   What kind of friend is this?13.2   ° Six in the second place means:Fellowship with men in the clan.Humiliation.Am I being the selfish one?Is the I ching telling me to not mix business with friendship and to just accept what happened and not demand any interest on this loan?  It's changing to hex 1...?  Any ideas?Last edited: May 8, 2009"
2588,"Good morning everyone i had a really strange experience and wanted to share it and see if this happened to anyone else and what you think of it. While sleeping last night I had a dream where I had to choose several books from a shelf for some reason and buy them. They were used books and in one of them I recognized the handwriting of the man whom I have a thing for in real life. He had written on the inside cover of the book several I ching readings! He didn't write the questions but he wrote the readings as 15.2 and underneath it 32. I immediately understood them to be I ching readings and I was shocked and astounded to find out that he ""uses"" the I ching too! In my dream I remember thinking ""oh, these readings must be about his ex girlfriend or something""  Then as I exited the used bookstore I felt as though I was being watched and just before entering the subway I turned and saw him staring at me from a distance away, but I didnt approach him, I just ducked underground and leftIn real life, he has no idea that I have feelings for him and I occasionally have dreams about him, but I have never had a dream involving a reading and I am not sure what to make of it. Has anyone else had random readings in a dream and do you take them as seriously as if you had thrown the coins? And what would you make about this situation seeing as in the dream, the readings were his, not mine? I'm completely fascinated by this dream!"

2590,"I recently failed to get a promotion at work.  I put a lot of emotion, energy, and a public face into the process.  Reviewing the process, I find that there are some genuine shortcomings I want to work on.  I also realized that the ""path"" related to this promotion isn't quite the right one for my particular strengths and interests.  The right path for me doesn't quite exist within the organization.  So now it comes time to put the best face on situation, figure out what I want to do differently, and see what I can do to create the more appropriate path.  Soul searching, I realize that the shortcomings and the nonexistence of the appropriate path are related.  From the inside out, my point of view: there's a ""What's the use?"" factor.  Why work harder at the wrong thing?  For that matter, why work hard at the right thing if it's not valued or understood?  From the outside in, from the organization's point of view: there's a ""Why should we extend ourselves for this person?"" factor.  Someone who feels familar and inspires confidence with the basics receives more latitude.  Nixon can go to China.  Somewheres, a way back, the pattern started that led to this point.  There is a sabotaging underlying story at work, to which I'm unwittingly committed.  But identifying the story isn't enough.  Before my public response to the setback, there is a private orientation and release that needs to take place.I ask myself, ""How can I release myself from the (my name for the self-sabotaging story) vow?""I consult.  The answer is 49 =>  37  (4,6).   Revolution/molting/stripping to the family.Any thoughts?"
2591,"Hello everyone,I've been feeling quite depressed, confused, anxious and worn down lately, not sure of where I am in life and all that. . .but wanting a change of some sort in any (or all) areas of my life but I'm not feeling too hopeful about it.I did a reading asking ""what do I need to get myself through for now?"" 50.3.4 to 4.Then I asked ""how do I bring this about or develop it?"" 62.4.5.6 to 53.These don't really seem very positive.  Does this mean that I need to go through some hard times for the time being? None of the lines are very positive.  Actually, the ones that aren't outright negative seem pretty neutral (62.5 for example).  And I think its pretty obvious that things aren't heading for change right away. that I must take one day and one step at a time. But what about this 50>4?On second thought, maybe the 62.4.5.6>53 is telling me that I should wait to see how this first reading should come about or develop, that I shouldn't keep asking questions  and trying to see too far ahead, over-analyzing all of the possibilities, and trying to take total control of my situation and where its going. I need to just be cautious and deal with what's in front of me.  I should trust the youthful folly of hexagram 4?  I hope someone can give me their input on these readings, too.  Thanks. "

2602,"Hello,I lived with some people who I learnt were not good friends.  One of whom though, I had good times with and do like and was kind of close to, although she also in a way betrayed me.  They are no longer in my life and unfortunately dissolution is the best way to describe the parting but definitely for the best.I recently heard from the one I got on with the least (money issues) in which I had to be firm with her about something - petty matter but I was in the right and she didn't like that, and said she was speaking for all when she said I was 'out of order' (it was about the smallest amount of money) though she started it all friendly-friendly.Anyway, that was that, but then I heard from the one I got on with best - just something small, but it could have been read in 2 ways: that she was being sarcastic (the distrustful part of myself) or friendly (to make up for the other girl perhaps - or at least show there's no hard feelings)I asked Was it a friendly gesture? 39Seems to speak of an inner connection obstructed by others perhaps?Can I trust her? 23.5Interesting line (v relevant!) but could be read in two ways it seems.  Originally Posted by trojanIn another thread I noticed Autumn interpreted 23,5 as something to do with 'civility' ? In general, observing an enemy, or a hostile force, and hiding your true intentions through sophisticated, ingratiating social displays (court ladies, fish), and thus transforming the original open enmity, and turing it into an advantage for your side of the competition. People who kill you with kindness, or backstab with kindness, or take advantage of you in a way that you thank them for it.Hmm.. 'the surest way to vanquish an enemy is to make him into a friend'I do think of her with affection but it wasn't a close friendship, but perhaps she does want to make up for things a little bit.I then had the idea of initiating further contact (not that I want to go back to that group or anything - just because I'd like to know how she's doing etc.)  I wrote out a message but then stopped myself - remembering I guess the hurt of it all.  It wouldn't be a big deal in itself - but it just felt wrong to send somehow.Send message?  55.3,5,6 > 13Perhaps simply, a waning friendship - or that I'm giving too much unnecessarily (considering how they treated me)Does that mean yes?23.2,4,5 > 6I took this as saying detach from her because she causes you inner conflict.I really am at peace with what happened but I think she's a good person, but the general mentality of that group was against me and she went along with that.I suppose I ask, because I wonder whether I should act on my friendly impulses?  But then maybe that's because, feeling in a happy expansive mood I chose to forget her having let me down.  It's probably a matter of thinking before acting on even positive (perhaps especially) whims because feelings change and it could just lay the path open to being 'wronged' again in some way, or at least feel foolish and regretting (again) being too nice.Probs best to split all together in other words, despite good intentions, some relationships just aren't meant to be.Would appreciate any thoughts/ experiences with the above lines but as I said, I am at peace with it all. Interested to hear takes on 23.5 - do you lean towards friendly gesture, or fake?:bows:"

There can also be potentially a moment when there's nothing I do will change the situation, so might have to wait until the time is favorable again...?I'm currently in the process of narrowing down the potential topics. I understand research is very time consuming, always need to study what have been done before I can come up with new ideas. Plus my thesis supervisor has been on sabbatical leave, so we have only communicated by emails so far. It would have been easier if I can talk to him in person.. While I'm waiting for him to get back to me with initial reading lists, I have been doing my own research, but lack of direction. Any help with interpretation and advice will be much appreciated.  Just would like to have some mental preparation...I started research last year on another topic (with another professor), but eventually had to quit it after 6 months of work as I found the topic a little bit too abstract.

I have asked what I have to do in this situation to be able to provide a happy and stable life for me and my son?How do I interpret this reading?  I guess hexagram 18 describes the present situation quite accurately but do I interpret both the changing lines as combined? I.e: in which a long-standing problem (18.4)is resolved easily (18.2) by moving abroad (hex 56) eg. to my country of origin, which I could possibly move to in about 3 months time?

Please advise me on the next direction to take in my work life.  2.2 to 7.Please show me the effect on me of working at A. 62.3.5 to 45.Please describe for me the effect on me of working at B. 28.3.5 to 40.I didn't ask about staying where I am now because when I concentrated on the question to ask it, it felt like I couldn't.  Usually there is a feeling of either something pulling me forward, pointing the way, or simply allowing me to move forward as I will but without any guidance.  This time it was as if there were a locked door in front of me and I knew I could get in by forcing my way through this door by just asking the question but would it be worth it?  Or perhaps it would be wrong to ask not because I wasn't ready for the information but because it would be asking something that I already knew, that it is time to move on. Is it worth busting through a door for something I am already aware of? No.  Anyway, that's why that question isn't here.I learn something new every time I post on here and get replies so I hope you guys can help me again. Thanks!"
2614,"I have been dealing with something on and off for awhile - I have a tendency to sabotage myself. It's uncomfortable, as I know myself pretty well, but don't understand this part of me. I asked the i ching - I don't know why I sabotage myself - i'd like to stop it for good. What do you recommend. I got: 37.6 - 63. I checked out previous hexagrams - part of it rings true - that is being true to yourself. Coming to the end of something - I'd like to think that this is positive- but I don't know. Has anyone been through this or have an insight to share? Thank you."
2615,"This is about me and a man..... We had a bad break up 2 years ago.  He is a stubborn closed man and has a hard time communicating any kind of ""feelings"". Because he could never tell me how he felt about me I ended it and shortly after deeply regretted it. He told me his pride was too important to take me back. I loved him more than anything and it was too hard to be friends. I just couldn't do it - mostly because of his new mean attitude towards me and jabs - that were clearly projections or insecurities never ceased and he never tried to console me after he would be mean.  He always called and tried to stay in my life. It hurt too much and he wouldn't take me back.  this went on for 2 years without us seeing other people. 3 months ago I ended all communication. And so here we are with ""How is _____ feeling about our situation, and what is going on with him?Hexagram 18 and then 26.Anybody have any feedback.Thanks "
2616,"Hello all, I need your opinions about these answers I got from IC.So... I have a friend. A guy that I like a lot. Sometimes I think he likes me too, but he's evasive. I mean, he's coming and going, leaving and returning (both litterally and metaphorically speaking)... Undecided, I think. Let's say that he doesn't let the relationship die, but he doesn't make it live either. The relationship, or rather the possibility of a romantic relationship. So I asked today:What are his feelings for me? - 1.6 > 43. Does it mean that I'm the arrogant dragon? (In thinking that he might have ""that"" kind of feelings for me?)Or, since it's a masculine line, it's about him and his ""being prepared to change / to move to the next level""?Or it's just that I haven't chosen the right question? So, I asked question no.2:What role do I play in his life? (I mean, now, not in the next 10 years...) - 24.1.2.3 > 46Does it mean that he will return from his continuos goings/leavings (as I said, litterally and metaphorically; he travels a lot and we never have time to sit and speak) and that my role in his life is increasing?Thanks.s."

2623,"Hello everyone,I would really be glad and thankful if you could share your thoughts about the following with me...The circumstances in a few words:After some breaks I am quite intensively working on my thesis (which has to be finished by June) these days. Apart from my University studies I am doing a training in another country and there would be another course next week. I try to keep this very short: as at this point of time I (somehow for the first time) am in a kind of 'flowing writing process', I thought about not attending the course next week (as this interruption might have a retarding impact on my thesis...). On the other hand attending the course might also bring inspiration with it (as it has to do with inner work I often find new strength...) and actually the course is compulsive (but I think I would find a solution...). Apart from this - if I didn't attend the course - I would have to cancel quite a lot of appointments I made which are somehow linked with this training...So today I decided to ask:What effect would it have on my thesis if I went to Switzerland next week?--> hex. 22and:What effect would it have on my thesis if I did not go to Switzerland next week?--> hex. 29 with changing fourth line turning into hex. 47I want to thank everyone for his/her support,with warm regards from Austria,zussnelda"

2625,"I have been looking at these threads for years but this is the first time I've felt the need to post something.  I am applying to eight PhD programs right now.  Getting in will be tough for me; I was a terrible student for the first half of my undergrad.  But I know I need a career/place change. I have been working in non-profit for nearly ten years.  I asked if a PhD was the right move for me and received 47.2.4 changing to  8.  I think I understand the ""Exhaustion"" aspect--I have been working full time and teaching at the college level.  If I pursue a PhD--it would be that and nothing else.  Which means a few years of doing without.  I am not relishing that.  But it would also mean picking one path--no more juggling.  That would be lovely.      I am not certain what to make of the changing lines: 2. Confined, one tends to drink. Officials come from all sides. Advantageous. Take advantage of making offerings else suffer exposure to dangers. No harm in this. and 4. Ambling along, one seems to be confined as if a metal chariot. Regret, but things are completed.All this changes to 8 which seemed to me to be encouragement to ask the i Ching whether I was up to the task of being a PhD candidate and ultimately a college professor.  So I did.  And I received 56.2.4.  It sounds like the academy will be limiting for me.  Which makes sense, but I think any ""career"" is slightly limiting, requiring one to assimilate with one's colleagues and environment to some extent.  No matter where I get accepted (if I get accepted) I would have to move.  I am REALLY looking forward to that.  I desperately need a change of scenery.  Frankly, I still cannot figure out what the ""answer"" is.  I think this is all way to personal for me right now (can't see the forest for the trees kind of situation).  So, what do you all think? Any advice?Thanks in advance,Jani"

I haven't told a soul but detect that there's a mutual attraction here. I have asked the I ching what I should do about this attraction I feel.

2627,"[B]41 Decrease and 1 Creative for world $ sitch[/B]Decrease (41) and The Creative (1) came up when I asked the i ching about my role as an individual in the current world financial situation.Akira Rabelais Book of Changes had this to say:""41. Sun / Decreaseabove  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAINbelow  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKEThis hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below is decreased to the benefit of what is above. This is out-and-out decrease. If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is out-and-out decrease. And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation and its lower classes to fail.THE JUDGMENTDECREASE combined with sincerityBrings about supreme good fortuneWithout blame.One may be persevering in this.It furthers one to undertake something.How is this to be carried out?One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand the time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a time of scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to provide inner strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need be no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of the content makes up for the simplicity of form.  There is no need of presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heart can be expressed.THE IMAGEAt the foot of the mountain, the lake:The image of DECREASE.Thus the superior man controls his angerAnd restrains his instincts.The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The mountain stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into anger. The lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into passionate drives at the expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease is necessary; anger must be decreased by keeping still, the instincts must be curbed by restriction. By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of the soul are enrichedTHE LINES°Six in the third place means:When three people journey together,Their number increases by one.When one man journeys alone,He finds a companion.When there are three people together, jealousy arises. One of them will have to go. Avery close bond is possible only between two people. But when one man is lonely, he is certain to find a companion who complements him.Six in the fourth place means:If a man deceases his faults,It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.No blame.A man's faults often prevent even well-disposed people from coming closer to him. His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment in which he lives. But if in humility he can bring himself to the point of giving them up, he frees his well-disposed friends from an inner pressure and causes them to approach the more quickly, and there is mutual joy.° Six in the fifth place means:Someone does indeed increase him.Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.Supreme good fortune.If someone is marked out by fate for good fortune, it comes without fail. All oracles-as for instance those that are read from the shells of tortoises-are bound to concur in giving him favorable signs.

2628,"My boyfriend and I are currently separated due to lots of issues. I'd really like us to get back together but there is one thing I cannot get over. In some ways it is minor, and others very important. He told a work colleague about a private issue between us, and she mentioned it obliquely and when I asked her directly- said yes, he had told her about it, and with details that made it absolutely clear that he had. She is definitely not a malicious person and wouldn't have made any of this up. I don't mind so much her knowing, but he told me specifically that he had not told anyone. I was suprised and asked him about it- though not in an angry way. He totally refuses to admit it, though it is very clear that he is lying. Basically the information shared is not so important, but the fact he keeps lying to me about it, even in the face of very overwhelming evidence.I asked ""what is the situation of our relationship right now"" and got Hex 38 lines 3,5 and 6 into Hex 43. In some ways this is an amazingly clear reading. But i still feel i'm missing something. I'm always impressed by the interpretations on this site and if you have anything to share, would be really grateful."
2629,"Hello,It has been a while hope you're all well! I've been trying to get my 'inner-house in order' recently... But I can relate to the previous thread - it has not been without moments of self-sabotage I have just applied for a job that would actually be amazing to get.  It would be interesting, I do need it (financially) and it actually relates to my degree and would be a definite step in the right direction!  But, recently I have really had a wake up call - humbled by the talent that's out there to compete with - and the hard work I need to do (I'm going for self-discipline mode..).  So, attempting to make waves in the work sphere I'm actually interested has made me feel small, but determined..  Reality-check would be the phrase of the month Anyway, I asked the Yi How should I consider my application?15.5 > 39I have had a little experience with the company and have done a related course - but have not had any proper practical experience of the job.  I am also young etc..The line does not seem clear cut - Is it advising to be firm and confident in my ability to do the job when challenged by my potential employees? But to remember to remain modest and 'obedient'?Thanks very much As the application has been sent it's out of my hands.. but perhaps if I'm called for an interview I should bear in mind something from this line??:bows:"
2630,"Hi all,I asked the I Ching what could be expected from easing an employee out of my company (by giving him a bad review, little sympathy, and laying down some stricter guidelines for his success).  This employee is a management headache, and although very smart, generally is hard to manage and difficult to focus, wanting to work on what interests him, but not necessarily what we need him to do.(All of you that are underemployed or unemployed probably hate me already because I am an employer who wants to trim the tree of undesirable growth, but I hope you believe that there are at least a few people working for me who like me and say I am the best employer they ever had!  This is all parenthetical to the question, but just to note that I do not regard all my employees in this unfavorable light.)Ok, back to Mr. X.  I received H33.3, H12.When I read a response like this from the I Ching, I am never sure whether to take them as they seem to be written, in that they seem to suggest or imply correct action on my part, or whether I should twist the syntax, etc, to try to make them describe the employee's actions and the results in the ""real world"", which is what I meant to ask about.  Is the general judgement suggesting that I should withdraw, conceal myself, and Line 3 suggesting that I can't withdraw and must employ helpers?  That is most logical to the situation...Or is the whole thing somehow describing the real world results...that, in Line 3, the employee is tangled and can't leave and simply withdraw?  I have a hard time changing the pronouns and making it all fit.  The employee should use servants and concubines?How do others resolve this problem?  By asking better, more precisely worded questions, perhaps.  I suppose I am just being too literal (and too egocentric) in reading the hexagram, but the language appears to be about my position, and not the employees.  Yet, by the way I meant the language, I meant it to be about what happens externally.Thanks for any help with this!"

I asked how I could refine the project to bring it in line with my ""vision"" for it, and received 5, Waiting, with changing line 2, to 63 (After Completion). I see this to mean that the foundations are in place and I have to carefully work to refine the project, eg not rest on my laurels but steadily, carefully move it in the direction I want.

This changes into hexagram 48.I made sure I relaxed before doing throwing the coins so I think I can have confidence in this reading - I am so chuffed that it is so positive. How accurate though, do people think these readings can be?  And there are certain parts of the reading that don't seem relevant, or at least that I don't see how they apply to the situation....I would be interested to hear any comments -( particularly as this reading is a new one and so positive )  -  from those who commented before on the last reading I did on this question, especially."

He also wants to get to know my son better like a buddy. I asked the I Ching a few questions regarding me telling him what I think of him. I recievedHow does R feel about the situation now? I don't know, this sounds solid maybe? Or cold reception? I have to let him take the lead? And just follow his q's?2.1.2 > 19What will be the result of my approach? Seems like a lot of changing lines here? I searched through the archives and I couldn't find these two hexagrams together to give full meaning of the Taming the Power of the Great leading to Retreat? I think it was line 5 about getting along like brother and sister? 26.2.4.5.>33Okay I might be jumping the gun a little here but I asked Will we be togther? 15.3 > 2 I thought this one read very well?

2638,Hi AllThis is my first post on this site. Though have been enjoying the site for many years.The question I put to the Iching was whether it would be advantageous to continue doing art as my main focus(I am a practising artist) and have a small job on the side; or conversely to change my current focus and get a 'proper' job and do art on the side. I ask this question because I do have a family and also want what is best for them. Obviously its very difficult these days(and perhaps always has been) pursuing a creative path in life as opposed to a more practical one. The answer i got was 25 present changing to 13.The answer is very interesting also because it relates directly to a book i am reading on the poetry of Tukaram - an Indian folk poet known for his innocence and humility. In many profound ways his life embodies the qualities of hexagram 25 - Innocence and 'the unexpected'.What do people think - is it as clear an answer as it appears to be??Thanks in advance!
2639,"Hi there,this is what i asked = hang on to a hope I have or skip it = take it out from my mind.so I asked: what if I put an end to this ""dream""/hope: 18 > 4and what If I continue to ""dream""/hope about this: 9 > 24I find 9 > 24 the most favourable answer. Do you agree?Thanks a lot"
2640,"This is my first post here, however I have been a lurker without joining for quite awhile.  The reason why I have finally joined is to get some input from objective parties on an ongoing situation in my life (not a relationship question either).So, here it is:  I asked why is there such a delay in me signing with a literary agent? (I have several looking at my work now, as an aside)  I received hexagram 5 with line 4 changing to hex 43.   I understand only a few things in regards to this - one is that line 4 is waiting in the blood, obviously I am really stressed about this delay and the iching is acknowledging perhaps? or am I wrong?  The resulting hex 43 I don't get.  Is the waiting eventually going to lead to a breakthrough? Because of my not understanding I asked - what can I do to help the situation along while I am waiting and I received hexagram 19 unchanging.  I thought about it for awhile and did some research.  I think that I am supposed to be preparing myself for what is about to happen but taking a more active role in my life, which I feel that I am doing with all of the queries I have sent out and following up on them, not to mention that I am continuing to write everyday.  Now, because I wanted further clarification on what was meant by hex 19 I asked it to clarify what it meant by that answer.  It gave me...Hexagram 5 again!!  This time with changing lines 1, 2, and 6 to hexagram 53.  The purpose of this long drawn out explanation is what I think it is trying to tell me is to keep doing what I am doing, writing and so forth but that I have to keep waiting.  If I try to push things too far by getting anxious and out of sorts then I'm only hurting myself because I'll get an agent eventually anyway, but only when the time is right.  Could someone else look at this and tell me if I am completely wrong here?  Thanks so much. "
2641,"After reading a recent post, I decided to borrow the question recently used by another member.  I was interested what the I Ching would reply on my behalf. I have been struggling for the past 18 months with the ending of a partnership and the unsatisfied wish for a reconciliation, wondering about a positive change in my life. I have submitted 3 prior posts about this relationship in March.I asked today:Will I get romantic, emotional & physical satisfaction in near future if yes how when???""Reply: Hexagram 16, unchangingEnthusiamI understood this to be a strong yes, thought perhaps it meant in the very near future.As, I will be seeing my former partner in the very near future, a casual outdoor outing...I wondered if the reply might be in relation to seeing J.I asked Is this J?Reply Hexagram 15 Modesty, unchanging. Possibly meaning uniting, from what I have read about this hexagramI asked in follow-up: How is J feeling about me, now?Hexagram 13 (Fellowship), lines 4.5.6 changing to 36 Darkening of the LightThe lines, perhaps a sequence of our process of change, and J's choice to keep his feelings hidden for a period of retreat.Any thoughts from members in the community? Thanks for your insights."
2642,"I have these strong feelings for somebody for a long time now. And I feel like it is mutual. But nothing, besides some intense looks towards each other, is happening.I tried to kill my feelings, I tried to stay away, I tried to ignore it. But it isn't working.My heart keeps pounding overtime each time we meet. I feel like an idiot.Now that spring is in the air, my question to the I Ching was: ""How can I seduce him?"" It answered 7.2 leading to 2.The way I see this is that I should try to get around him more often, but let him take the initiative. And that we will get together then?Or does it say I should get around other people more, and I will meet somebody else?Some help would really be appreciated. Thank you. "
2643,"hello all. I got a 55 with the question Should I go this weekend. I would be going to this place to find out an answer to a question i have.After getting a 55 the answer was pretty obvious  Felt like it was saying ""Dude...Are you really asking this question  GO!!!""What do you guys think?I did internet search on 55, and it says Abundance. My book says: Completion.The king , clear insight has occupied his rightful throne, the body.There is no need anymore for fear, and worry that insight will get lost,even though it is hiding deep down like the bottom line.The core of the hexagram indicates that you do not dare let your light shine. Only with action can you make the truth obvious, and reach up to the midday sun, which is shining with insight and fulfillment. Then the bottom line changes places with with the 5th line making completion a fact.The movement  of the sun, and moon are like the heart beat of life, and indicate the proper time for action. After the moon has become full it begins to wane.Last edited: Apr 20, 2009"
2644,"last night my son emailed me that a friend's premature baby is not going to make it, ""They are turning off the machines and saying goodbye.""I asked the I Ching for a comment and received Hexagram 28. unchanging:28.The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.It furthers one to have somewhere to go.Success.His little body just didn't have the strength and it was time for him to leave.The superior man, when he stands alone,Is unconcerned,And if he has to renounce the world,He is undaunted.He's okay with it. The soul is at peace._I wanted to share this reading with you all not just because sharing it makes me feel less sad, but also as a memorial to baby Seamus because it was such a fitting reading. I like to think that even though his time here was just a few short weeks he can know he contributed to humanity and even increased our understanding of the I Ching.God bless you all, Dear Friends.Rosada"
2645,"Hi again a friend of mine B recently got word that a guy from her past was wanting to get back in contact with her very soon. They had quite a fall out years ago as he just bailed and she got very hurt at the time. She's concerned as to how he's planning to approach her, more so she can be prepared (i.e. there's still alot of anger there on her part). Plus she seems to think his ""mood"" and attitude will determine a lot about his respect for her and his sensitivity to the painfully drawn out situation (on her part as she can only speak for herself) i.e. mainly if he'll be acknowledging it in any way.So I asked the IC on her behalf....Is M's attitude and mood going to be serious or laughing and playful?I got 8.5.6 > 23According to LiSe 8.5 seems to be about being ethical and therefore letting bonds/connections come naturally and 8.6 is about the pitfalls of moving forward without a group head/leader??And 23 seems to be about stripping away and finding what's truly good within??Could it be IC giving her a message?

2647,"My first question was When will he be back? (he broke up with me in August. He called me on Easter in response to a card I sent him. He hadn't made contact prior to that even when I sent him a note earlier in the year. Am I assuming too much to think he will be back?The primary hex was #53, gradual development, with a changing line 3. The relating hex was 20, seeing with no changing lines. Not sure how this applies.In light of the 3 changing line in the primary hex, I asked a second question Will he stay?The primary hex was 42, Blessings with a 5 changing line.I'd be grateful for some experienced insight on these two readings. Blessings,Pattie"
2648,i asked this question is it the end of our relationship? and i got hexagram 31.....
2649,"i got hexagram 32 what does that meanthank u allLast edited: Apr 21, 2009"
2650,"Hey all,I'm pretty confident finding and getting jobs. Today I got a email for a interview..so I asked the Yijing, ""what would be the effect if I took this interview with NEXT"" I came out with the hexagram 3.I'm going look deeper into it, however I also like someone else's view.Thanks in advance!"
2651,"Hi everyoneI am currently looking for a new martial art. I have been practising contemporary and traditional kungfu for the past 3 years now. But at the school that I am ; there's no improvement for me anymore. I was scouting a couple of martial arts and I came down to these three: karate, taekwondo, wing chung. So I've asked the iching for all three: what is the outlook if I go on this martial art.Taekwondo: 34.3>54Karate: 41.5>61Wing Chung: 1.2>13So the choice is between karate and wing chung. What do you think?They both seem very auspicious."
2652,"Dear All,Concerned about getting wires crossed with a good friend - the situation has gone so bad she has withdrawn and talking to her about this seems to do no good. I asked the IC whether I will be able to mend our frienship, the answer came up as 38.3 - the hex pinpoints our currrent situation perfectly, as we are at total odds right now. But does this bode well for reconciliation? Your comments are greatly appreciated, as ever."
2653,"dear all,in two days i'm turning 26 and asked the iching, quite simply, what is the attitude i should assume in this upcoming year.i received 27.3.6 to 36. i don't quite get 27.3 ... could you help me?thanks a lot,blessingsElisabeth:bows:"
2654,Hi All Been doing a few posts the last few days. My current situation really need to make a drastic change regarding my finances I asked the Yi about my finance so all i could gather was that the road I was taking was not working so obviously I need to change tact.I have come with a fairly good plan to recover this week to a degree. I mean if only half of it worked it would be a relief.The last two readings I did yesterday were before I thought I needed to think along these lines.I asked the Yi will my plan help my finances this week44.4.5>18Could someone possibly explain this to me from an outside perspective. Really looking what I need to do.:bows:Steve
2655,"Hello,I have this friend who has a weird place in my life, i dont know whats going on. We sometimes dont talk for years, than we are all good and close, interesting, different friendship. The thing i am wondering is if i should just let him out of my life, i dunno if i should ask this though, what am i supposed to learn from this friendship.Anyways i asked why this friend entered my life and got 26.3.4 going to 38...Any thoughts?D."
2656,"Hey there folks                           I have read a bunch of posts regarding 23.6 -> 2 but this question is really important to me and I was hoping to get your opinions on my specific situation.I am in a relationship with a guy, we have been together for about 3 months. I really do love this guy, he is an amazing man. I do feel like the relationship is becoming more of a friendship, with a marked decrease in sensuality and desire for sex from both of us. We still talk all day and catch up a few times a week or more and have a great time together but we aren't romantic with each other at all really. I feel we are connecting more and more but just not in a romantic/partner type way. I also feel that I don't think he is in the same place as me spiritually and that I would really like a partner who was. I have started to think maybe I would like for us just to be really good friends. He even said something to me about him thinking about me in that way more now than before, not in a sexual way.I asked the Yi 'Will X and I end our relationship soon?' and got 23.6 -> 2. I saw two main interpretations to this. Either that all the things that have been bugging me about being with him as a boyfriend will now be gone and we can start the relationship afresh (which now written seems highly unlikely) or that we will end the relationship and if I act well then I have the chance to salvage the connection and even obtain my ideal situation of us being very close friends.I am not really sure if I am just reading this without a bias or something Objective input very welcome!Thank you!!!u_n"
2657,"dear all,I'm posting my update here this time since the 63.3 thread turned to be more of a shared reading than a divination discussion, so . .I've kept close everyone's ideas posted on that thread, stayed them and gradually (53?  ) I  feel like getting out of the woods . .Yi has given me waking calls from time to time and gently goaded me forth . . one interesting manifestation of a reading I had mentioned last, a 63.2 has materialized even in the most literal way -I can't even count the times i put back in place that new curtain in my room lol! I did realize it also in other, more metaphorical/symbolic waysAnyways, I'll spare you the explicit details this time -not all of them were peaceful or nice I have to say, yes, some heads had to roll, and no, not in a ing way last time I checked with the Yi though about 'a diagnosis of my 63.3' I got 8.4 to 45(and I'll quote Wilheim for those of us who still haven't learned him by heart )Six in the fourth place means:Hold to him outwardly also.Perseverance brings good fortune.Here the relations with a man who is the center of union are well established. Then we may, and indeed we should, show our attachment openly.

2659,"Hello all again,I wanted to ask you about your interpretation of 30.1.2, moving to 50. It is the second time I receive this reading but this time I ask specifically to the I Ching to tell me something to help me in my anger that I have been experimenting when a someone that I care a lot about cancelled our appointment. Regardless the motives for this cancellation which I didn't ask, and regardless we are going to meet later next week, and regardless -now that I see better I think it was good that we didn't meet today because I was feeling a bit tired and I even considered earlier today to move our appointment, later I felt extremely angry towards him, which helped me to release this feeling -I have been throwing punches in the air so strongly... I didn't like that he cancel!!! In the midst of my anger I told the I Ching - please tell me something, talk to me! - and I received 30.1.2, changing to 50. Would you please tell me what you think about this reading?Thank you so much!Beth"
2660,"Let's say someone has found a way to revive communication with another person. As the answer to a question regarding the possible communication might develop after that, IC gave: 16 > 9.Enthusiasm does sound positive and encouraging, especially since there's this image of ""music as the source of inspiration and movement"" and this approach involves art just as well. Furthermore, the person is anything but arrogant, pushy or agressive and the way he is planning to approach is very positive yet mild and unbinding.However, since all the lines are changing the whole weight is pushed to the other hex, 9, which is, as I gather, about ""not hoping for any major changes"".All in whole, can the overal answer be seen as: the way of approach is, though enthusiastic, wrong and won't bring anything much? Or as: the approach is good but it will take time for the communication to be (re)established?I am never quite sure what to pay attention to with so many changing lines...Thank you for your insights.sollina"

2663,"Hi you all.I have been around here for a while, reading the posts and trying to learn some more about the I Ching with I got first contact many years ago. It's not what many people think, a divination tool, but a book of wisdown.Well, I learned here I Ching doesn't go well with certain kind of questions, so I was reluctant to ask mine; but then that one was the question I really wanted to ask, all my energies and mind was in it so asking something different maybe woudn't have work....I recently broke-up with my partner of 6 months, his idea  and I asked to I Ching in plain wordsWill he and I go back together? I got hexagram 31.3 to 45It seems to me that is a yes, but I would like to hear what others think. My interpretation of the reading is obviously biased, cause that is what I want. So please guys, help me out here. Thanks in advance "
2664,"Show me a picture of if I stay with my cousin for the winter.Hexagram 26.1.6 > 46.26: The Taming Power of the Great. Perseverance furthers. Not eating at home brings good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water.line 1: do not take actionline 6. OK to take action (In what time frame??)46. The Judgement - Pushing upward has supreme success.  One must see the great man. Fear not. Departure toward the south Brings good fortune.The Image - Within the earth, wood grows:  The image of Pushing Upward. Thus the superior man of devoted character Heaps up small things In order to achieve something high and great.The south seems positive. Where, exactly, is ""south""?Hex 26 says that travelling is good and ""not dining at home"". Well my cousin is family, in theory at least. Does that mean this is a bad idea, or is ""home"" where my parents are?  The context here seems like a double mirror to me."
2665,Was wondering if someone could help me interpret these readings. I threw them recently to try to gain some insight into something that has been on my mind for some time - this thing that is confronting me in my own territory so to speak. How should I get used to this rising power of X in my life? 45It reminds me of church or religious gatherings.  Switch belief systems? Join the crowd? So I asked:So do I need to just worship X (kind of a sarcastic question but honest as well)?30.5 -> 13Blown away by that answer I said:Oh so X is better than Y - superior the ultimate truth and everything I know is wrong ?21.6 -> 51Well I don't feel like worshiping X - please comment.27.4 -> 21I know not a very profound line of questioning. But it is dealing with something pretty profound and has been on my mind for a long time and will probably be on my mind for the rest of my life - unfortunately or fortunately...I can't quite reckon if this divination is leading me gently in some certain direction that is toward some inevitable truth that I will be unable to handle? That will completely shatter my reality. Leave me paralyzed and unable to escape... etc. I'm sort of looking for a new paradigm but this that is being offered I can't say fits with me so well. As a matter of fact it sort of leaves out ... a big aspect of everything I know - am and are fond of. It would mean: so much of everything is a lie totally put out there just to deceive (something which I can't quite believe because it sounds like a paranoid pot-headed idea). Nonetheless I'm up a creek without a paddle. Thus my sincere but glib if not irreverent line of questioning. Well hope thats enough to provide sufficient grounds for interpretation.Thanks in advance.
2666,"hello lovely people,i asked i ching, should i break up with him , and it gives me hexahram 16 entusiasm what does that mean? i feel confused about the interpretation. thank you all."

I'm gonna be vague here for privacy and becausethe exact details of my question should not very important. The question was about accepting this power of ""another"" as superior in this way according to what some have said. ""Please comment about seeing X's as superior?""It said:8.2 -> 29I can't understand what it means. Generally it's said that this aspect is superior...I don't know what to think - I myself am not really in the know about it...But it would automatically mean that I'm inferior in this area. 8.2 to 29 I don't know how to interpret that.

2671,"Hi, my doctor has had me on oral Diabetes meds and high bp meds for quite a while.  However, I've stopped taking these meds, though it's been several months since my last check-up.  Over the last year I've lost weight, taken up yoga, and am exercising on an elliptical cross-trainer.  I am taking some vitamins and herbal supplements, but I thought to ask the Ching what would be the consequences of NOT taking my meds--if I'm endangering my health or if not.  Some natural health types feel that these meds do nothing but mask symptoms, not cure or improve the underlying condition--but who knows if this is really true?  I phrased the question something like: ""My health if I do not take bp and diabestes meds?""  I got:60, Limitations (Wing)  with 6 in the 3rd and 6th place, moving to 9 Restrained (Wing).  27, ""Nourishing"" is the inner hexagram of 60 (sounds right), and if I change just 6 in the 3rd I get 5, Calculated Waiting (according to Wing) and I get 61, Inner Truth, if I just change the top line.  Looking at the other related hexagrams seems to cloud the issue for me.  My sense is that the judgment is telling me that I'm better off taking my meds -- that limitations (limiting my physical symptoms?) are called for, but that galling limitations (things that bug me or cause me mental stress--such as taking medication) should be avoided.  As with so many readings, this seems to me to be capable of being interpreted either way.  Does anyone else have any tips for coming up with an interpretation that feels ""right""?Thanks!Chad"

2675,"As I am facing a rather large, life-changing decision now, I recently posed two questions to the Yi. For the sake of simplicity I will leave the details of the actions/plans out and just provide the answers here.1) If I do X (Plan A) what affect will it have on my life?Hex. 3.1 and Hex 8.From what I gather 3 and line 1 suggests waiting (not sure for what or for how long) because there is an unseen hindrance, and getting help from friends somehow. 8 suggests I can choose my own path and need not fear. (?) (which doesnt really answer the question, i was looking for ""yes go ahead"" or ""no, bad idea""...smthing like that)2) is there another option that will allow me to cultivate self-fulfillment?Hexagram 10 Treading, lines 1,5,6;   and hex. 40 DeliveranceI have trouble with Treading -- to me it suggests biding time/waiting/not really acting out. (?) LIne 1 to me implies do it yourself/go it alone if you want freedom. Line 5 - be careful. Line 6, good fortune in the end? (?)With hex 40, does that LITERALLY refer to the southwest on the globe or in a certain country? Or people who might be from that area, to accept help from them, or to go there myself (southwest)? I read, ""Turning back is favorable"" ...but turning back to what?As slight background, visa issues in the country where I am residing are forcing me to leave after this summer. I haven't a job but i have to ""go"" someplace for shelter. Hence the questions."
2676,"hello again  I am struggling with healing over a hurt involving someone I cared about and connected with strongly on my part and seem to be moving forward but every few months I take a few steps back in the sadness and depression stakes! I asked the IC""How can I heal from the X situation aside from meeting someone new?""I got 47.3.4 leading to 48 which I took to mean that I'm weighed down with oppressive conditioned thoughts (line 3) and that healing will eventually come but unless I free my mind of those thoughts it will happen much slower (but it will still happen if I do my best). Not sure about the 48??I then asked ""How long will it take for me to get that freedom of mind i.e. within a few months or longer?""I got 34.3 leading to 54 which I took to mean it will all happen if I act with thought and strategy as opposed to pushing forward with an aggressive desire to be free??? So based on that I also asked ""How can I free my mind of this oppression?""I got 44 unchanging - this is about opening yourself to welcome what comes i.e. don't try to control an intense encounter. It talks about a brief encounter????So I then finally asked ""Will I experience an intense encounter in the next few months?""I got 63.2.4.6 changing to 1I took this to mean that what is meant to come to me will (and it will), but that I shouldn't relax about it but rather always be cautious because I could trip up at any time and lose it. Does this sound right??? How accurate is the IC if you ask for a certain time frame i.e. ""a few months"" in this case?This last question is very similar to one I posted earlier this week that Willowfox kindly responded to i.e. I asked if I was going to meet a life partner that I liked a lot and I got 62.1.4.5 to 63 which seems quite similar to this answer! i.e. Willowfox said I would meet someone but whether I would hang on to him or not would be another story. And that a period of waiting was in order so perhaps 6 months away i.e. October....thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out. I am truly wishing with all my soul to heal over this situation so I can move on, but I get road blocks every now and then which bring me right down...I hope I have interpreted the IC correctly enough to have asked all these questions - but either way they can stand alone so I would appreciated any feedback.Jazzy "
2677,Hey guys!I needed a little bit of clarity concerning my unfolding life path so I asked the I Ching to show me my ideal and rightful role in this reincarnation and how to go about achieving it?The answer was Hexagram 55.1.3 changing to Hexagram 16.Any ideas? I really need some help figuring out my uhh 'purpose'? Oh and I'm a little concerned about line 3 which speaks of a 'broken arm'?
2678,I asked two questions in a row with a span of a few hours in between. The first question was regarding whether or not I should join a certain business venture and the second question was regarding a special someone and if they would return. The I Ching answered both times with Hexagram 14.5 changing to Hexagram 1!! Same changing line! What's the deal? Is it perhaps trying to tell me something outside of the original questions?
2679,"hello lovely people :bows:,i asked i ching,  if i should break up with him, i love him but iam just affraid that he is not the right one for me, and dont want my heart to be broken, we knew each other throught internet year ago, and we only saw each other once.. my heart tell me somehow it is going to work, but my mind tell me that it is almost impossible.... anyway it gives me hexahram 16 entusiasm what does that mean? i feel confused about the interpretation. thank you all."

Father figures? and i have seen that the hex 51 gives the time march/april which is around now, i should start acting before it is too late, is this the hidden message?

2683,"I've been having some very upsetting tensions with a colleague who I not so long ago believed to be a friend. All was well with us until our new boss arrived, and ever since then we've had tense, snappy exchanges followed by an easing up, but the tension always returns and we never talked about it. I think my colleague felt insecure about her position as I was up for a promotion,and resented me for pushing for it. Anyway, it's been months and even though I think things have gotten better, every time we're alone there's this dead silence, and it's making it difficult to work at times because I feel a real hostility and competitiveness coming from her. I think I'm also adding to the tension by being a bit paranoid and over-sensitive. In any case, it never seems to be the ""right"" time to ask her to talk about it (other colleagues around, etc),so I'm considering sending her a friendly but honest e-mail saying all of this upsets me and I'd like us to talk about it. I asked the YI two similar questions:--""Would sending this email be positive""? -- received 31, influence, with changing line 5, to 62. --""Will I regret it if I sent her this email?"" --got 24, Return, with lines 1 and 5, changing to 8 (Holding Together).The second reading especially encourages me, but to be honest I worry that doing this will only irritate her and make me more vulnerable.

We have not been in contact for some months and following some general questions I've made regarding my love life in general something in the answers made me think that I could ask about this guy so my question was: what can i expect if i go out and get m?

2687,"Hex 20.3 > 53Hi,I'm hoping to get some help in interpreting those hexagrams. It's probably best if I start by describing the situation first.There is this person in the same class who I really want to get to know better. We have been working in the same group since January. But our conversation never went beyond assignments. He seems to be a very career-oriented person, always busy with work and had to skip classes many times. So I didn't get to see him a lot in person. Even our meeting has been only once per week through voice conference, that lasted about 15 mins each time...Monday was the last class. He first came to sit next to me. But after a while, I did not have much to say. So he moved to sit next to the other guy classmate. At the end of our presentation, I tried to start some casual conversations (but to no avail) and let him know that I would like to get in touch, but I did not see very positive response from him. The only good sign I observed so far is that during the few times he ever came to class, he would look for me first and always gave that friendly smile. He also seems to be more comfortable to rely on me  (than any other members) and asked me questions regarding the course. To make the long story short, I don't even know him. So, it is obviously just a crush.. but I wonder a lot about his personality.  This is really the first time I found it so difficult to approach someone. I'm ready to give up and let it go. A career person will be very tough to deal with, right ? . Besides, he could have been married, or in a relationship with someone else.  Anyways, these are the hexagrams I received:1) On Monday, the Yi gave me Hexagram 15 - Modesity, without changing line. I did not really formulated my question because I was kind of disappointed from his lack of positive response. 2) Yesterday, I received Hexagram 25 (Wu Wang, with no changing line) from asking what he could possibly think about me.3) Today, the Yi gave me Hexagram 37 (Family) with changing line 2, which gave Hexagram 9, Little Accumulation. I asked whether there was anything else I could do...I think the most I could do is to add him to Facebook.  If he does not approve, the answer will be obvious.I've been trying to understand their meanings and how I can relate the answers to each other, but I would like to see any opinions regarding this.

So apologies if it appears twice but here it is again as a new thread......Also, here is the link to the 2008 post I'm referring tohttp://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?p=87751#post87751 Hi I am new to the forum but have read numerous postings while learning about the IC. It's been great to get so much insight  thank you Hilary, Rosada, Willowfox, Dobro, LightofReason, Frank and everyone who contributes to the exploring divination section seem so dedicated When I first starting consulting the IC and learning I thought it didn't answer questions about what the future holds  but I came across this posting from last year where someone asks exactly that i.e. about a new man appearing. So i asked a similar question - ""Will a life partner that I really like a lot, come into my life in the near future?"" and I got 62.1.4.5 which leads to 63I get my answers from various sources online but mainly from the Total I Ching book by Stephen Karcher. His response for this one says....62.1 ""small traverses, he acts like a flying bird, trap! the way closes"" and he goes on to say not to impress people but to stay low and humble and grounded and don't fly away because if you do you'll surely regret it (funny because I'm definitely planning to go away for 3 months in November this year but was also seriously considering a short holiday in July)62.4 ""small traverses, this is not a mistake. He does not pass it by, he meets it. Let the adversity that is going be a necessary warning. Don't use this in a long-term Trial"" he then explains that this means the transition is made and the small has found the connection and this is not a mistake...to take a look at dangers you've just passed through, the memories and ghosts and to let them be a warning i.e. don't go back(well I have been through considerable pain trying to get someone out of my mind and heart these past few years, not to mention waiting and hoping for a strong connection to come along)62.5 ""small traverses, shrouding clouds bring no rain yet. it comes from our western outskirts. A prince with a string-arrow grasps another in a cave"" He explains this as the ""climax above"" and that the culmination is coming, the autumn rains and the harvest....""You make an enduring connection with someone who is in retreat. This will open up a whole new life""....then adds it will be ""a stimulating influence...""D that sounds very positive!! as if I WILL meet someone I connect strongly with)Could anyone please shed light and confirm if I'm on the right track.....other sites say completely different things!! Like the LiSe site which seems to always be offering a translated ""moral to the story"" for the questioner as opposed to being more literal and reflecting what the situation involves based on exactly what the oracle is saying. Also how do you determine dates from readings? I notice Willowfox refers to august and also ""this year"" in the posting above which was posted in April 08 I think......Much appreciatedJasmine (Jazzy)"
2689,"Me and my husband are planning on separating in few months. It has been a 7 year marriage with one child. I and my husband do not have any emotional/physical bond . It is my husband who has somehow lost interest and does not even want to work on making it better though initially I wanted the relationship to work.  Now I have given up . though this is a very difficult decision for me since I wanted the marriage to work.I asked the question ""will i get romantic, emotional & physical satisfaction in near future if yes how when???""I got hexagram 22 with no changing line....in this question my focus was more on abstract things like will I ever get the satisfaction that has eluded me till now in my married life..I asked another question today""Is there another man in my life.when and how will i meet him""I got 42.3In this question my focus was more on if there is another person in my lifeLook forward to your insights.."
2690,"Hello everybody!First of all, I'd like to wish you all Happy NOWruz aka the beginning of Spring! My fave time of the year Ok, so as can be seen by the title of this post, I am going through some much needed changes right now. The changes are still in the mental/emotional state but are now beginning to take shape in material reality as well. A little background on my situation: I've just recently been emerging from a depression(which I only admitted now) and have been doing ALOT of thinking and reviewing of my life. Basically I was in a cocoon of sorts, a total hermit for several months, spending my solitude restructuring myself from the inside out..So, as of recently I had certain signs and indications of a transformation that is to come in my life which I intuited would start this very Spring.My question for the I Ching was how to bring about this transformation in my life where I would finally be free from the shackles of the past so I can spread my wings and fly?The I Ching answered with Hexagram 50.1.5 changing to Hexagram 1Is it as fabulous as it sounds? I am turning over the cauldron as we speak! "
2691,"Hi again, I know this is my second posting in 2 days but both situations are important to me as I value my friendships and also don't want to waste time on those who are not keen to pursue a friendship with me.....I made a friendship connection with my ex-boss last year but it was difficult to explore because a) he has a wife and b) they are a very cliquey couple from interstate and keep to themselves a lot. I feel that there was also tension between J and I because I had the strongest gut feeling he knew a guy with whom I had a big fallout in previous years, and that he was kind of snooping for facts (but this was all just a strong intuition and never confirmed).We haven't been in touch since before Christmas, but his wife gave birth to their baby girl this week and he posted pics on his facebook account so I got the news! I posted a genuine, humorous and warm message on his home page congratulating them. This is the second friendly message I've posted since we last spoke, and the first time he responded with something very short and light, but friendly. This time nothing yet, but then again he's very busy with his new family!!Wondering if this friendship is worth putting further energy into, I asked the IC How does J feel about me now?I got 43.6 > 1 which in Karcher says to call out i.e. if you don't communicate your message now, the way will close. It also refers to a pitfall, like a warning, in LiSe's online book.Then I asked..What does J think about my message regarding his new born baby?I got 7.6 > 4 which totally confused me because of the 4 contradicting line 7. which in Karcher talks about receiving the mandate and becoming a leader.I asked again and got 7.1.2.6 > 27I threw in a few other different versions of these questions i.e. What does J think about me now that I've posted the message? and got 63.3 > 3 (which I don't really understand at all)and also...Would he prefer that I go away from his life? and got 47.1.3.4 > 5Karcher says 47.4 means that it will come slowly slowly, and it would be better to have a mind free of worries, but either way, the way will openBasically, I'm not sure if there's still a friendship there. These answers don't sound all that positive but they don't seem to be a clear negative either.I was pretty outspoken when I worked for him (a 4 month contract as a consultant) which I know he both really liked/respected but also felt confronted by. Plus there was always this issue about him possibly knowing this other guy, which seemed to be an underlying energy between us i.e. that once I felt this, I was suspicious and even somewhat angry.If anyone could shed any light I would really appreciate it. I just want to move on from this ""friendship"" either way i.e. I would hate to be pursuing with friendly messages if he really wasn't interested.thanks as alwayssofia "
2692,"Hello again senior members I've asked the IC about a situation with my Law uni class, particularly with regard to one guy K.Some background.....we're all mature aged students and have already completed a semester together, so there's definitely familiarity as well as sprouting friendships, lots of after class conversations, although no solid out-of-uni friendships yet bar a couple of students who do seem to be meeting up. I believe I am well-liked in general and because I tend to speak my mind honestly, I tend to take on the spokesperson role for various things, which it seems everyone likes and appreciates. And for those whom it might aggravate a bit, I still get a sense of appreciation anyway. There's a general sense of solidarity and support amongst us, like we're a little family i.e. it's all positive as opposed to bitchy or cliquey. Except for this situation.......K (a guy) obviously likes T (a girl) but she hasn't at all proven interested beyond friendship BUT has hogged his attention nevertheless, to the point that no one can get near him!! So they've become a ""couple"" almost but without the girlfriend/boyfriend thing. I know there's nothing more than mateship because he told me they met up only once over the summer break (which is 3 months). She's not really friendly with anyone else (more so because she's pretty ""into herself"" and it's all about me, me, me). Last semester, K did mix a lot more, and used to even flirt a bit with me, and be a bit cheeky with everyone. This semester he just sits next to T and they talk amongst themselves and just won't mix. He won't even make decent eye contact with me and I've not seen him talk to anyone else properly all semester. I asked the IC the following string of questions but am still confused as to what the answers mean. Maybe by following the succession someone can weave a story for me?? What is up with K and T i.e. why won't K talk to me or anyone else?I got 7.2 > 2Why won't K talk to me or be friendly?I got 61 unchanging (?? does this mean he's trusting his instinct or that he sees me as having a sincere open heart? OR is the IC telling me I should trust my instinct i.e. that he doesn't want to upset T)Is he avoiding me because he doesn't want to upset T?I got 21What is he trying to bite through?I got 10.6 > 58So I asked again....Why won't Kurt talk to me or be friendly?I got 37.4.5 > 30 (which doesn't make sense because it talks about being helpful and looking out for others and being like a genuine father figure??)Then I thought I'd get straight to the point and ask.....What does K feel for me?I got 58.2 > 17 (which I took to mean he would like to have a true exchange with me??)So I asked....Then why isn't he approaching me or talking to me?I got 33.1.4.5 > 22 (which totally confused me!! especially since it's about totally retreating but doesn't say why except for the 22, which I can't relate to this situation)Sorry there are so many questions but hopefully the trail creates a clear picture for one of you to clarify By the way, I like K but I am not interested in him as anything more than a friend.....thanks as alwayssofia "
2693,"I guess is the most asked quest...I'm new. Love IC, and really appreciate this forum!I have a strange difficult and also lovely connection with a guy since a year. Sometimes lover, now ""frinênds""..forme not easy like this, for him beter, but sine my emotional sharing during a trip, he withdrowed...I asked, what will happen next to us and had:64.1.2 to 21Someone what to say something?:bows:axia"
2694,"Hi,I have recently moved away from a society (sounds like I'm straight out of a Jane Austen novel!   which I have been used to for the past 4 years.  There is only one true friend I have left there, while the others I was less close to but enjoyed spending time with.. maybe because of my shyness or difficulty in groups, or because I was just different, and there is sadness because there are some who I will miss (others definitely not) but don't really expect to see again..  I also didn't leave on a high, but no quarrels.. just a bit disappointing but probably inevitable.. anyway, time for moving on and 'molting' I guess.. I do wonder if I have been a selfish non - team player in some way (I feel I've moved on, and nothing for it but to forget - not cut ties, just not regard in my life anymore because I know they don't regard me (says it all really)  But it's a shame I don't feel that life is still open to me because of how it ended.. so I asked is this right?59.3,4,5,6 > 32An enduring dispersion?  Seems to say sometimes dissolution is necessary for a new beginning - probably a lot of that group are moving on to different things now.  So would you say the Yi is just highlighting it as a natural progression?Also 59.6 - perhaps my extricating myself from that environment has saved trouble (for myself and perhaps them as I didn't fit in brilliantly) and is beneficial - Dissolving his blood (so that it can't be shed) I also asked why I have now failed with friendships (groups) twice, where bad has outweighed good ultimately..29.1,2,3,5 > 36I have definitely learnt and finally accepted that it is not worth trying to fit in with a group - much better to value the close friends and follow your nature rather than how you think you should be..  Would the reading be highlighting that when in a dangerous situation (ie a group of people I am unsure about) I should protect myself, and hide my light from them?  Makes sense because in the past I have tried to make it work and pretended all was well, but ended up an outsider anyway..  It's just that I like people and groups, but I guess the problem stems from the pressure I then place on myself to 'perform' and then end up feeling inadequate, so I don't contribute well.. I do know as well that it has been due to a lack of common ground and differing attitudes etc sometimes too.. and certain people with bad and superior attitudes...Another reading I am unsure about is about my recent living situation which was constantly up and down - sometimes I felt comfortable, other times not.. primarily due to one person but they were a group, and made it clear by the end that they didn't consider me much at all.. and it just dissolved.What did I do wrong?54.5Could that be saying that they just weren't suited to me and I should wait for better opportunities for friendships?Any light you could shed on these readings would be great I am at peace with the situation, though thinking about it does make me sad, I know it's just a case of finding where you belong (or realising that you can also be fine without) like the Ugly Duckling Story I was advised to read when I first posted about friendship troubles :bows:"
2695,"Last night prior to going to bed, felt *stress* about flow of money .. looking at my current reality (the way I perceive it), feeling a lot of pressure lately ... I have 3 of my older kids living with me (late teens/early 20's) and sometimes feeling like I wonder if I can ""do this"".  I love my career, but at this very moment it isn't bringing in as much as I would desire.  I know I am at an opportunity to ""re-create"" - set new direction, intention .... anyhow .. here's the question I asked before going to sleep:""Guidance on Prosperity, opening up to manifesting more than enough for myself & my family""I received 27 unchanging.  I would appreciate any & all suggestions regarding the guidance I received.  I am getting that things are in perfect balance as a result of prior ""thinking, intending, etc"" .. basically the result I am experiencing is the perfect outcome to what I had been living, ""nourishing myself with"" (thoughts, etc).  I want to break out of this pattern of ""getting by"" and lack.  I would welcome any insights and also some ideas on questions for further insight & guidance.Thank you all ..peace,Beth"
2696,Hi AllI thought I might asked my question again in a different manner.How is my old friend's circumstances doing in general.10.1.4>59Am I right to think they are in a abit of jam but will come good in time.Thx Steve
2697,"Hi All I did a reading today as have been wondering about a friend that has moved away and I guess we could have parted on better terms. I have no way of tracking them even if I thought I should.I asked the Yi how is my friend doing and recieved 38.2.5>51I thought it was a strange reply.I looked at the lines and 51 Is it that I will meet this person out of the blue?.thankyou for any help , I would be interested on how others may interpret this readingSteve:bows:"
2698,"I've been stuck for a while now in some roundy roundy thoughts about a particular person. I know we will never have the type of relationship I want and the friendship has suffered and now it's time to let it go.  I really WANT to let it go now.  I asked the yi ""how can I get over x?""I received 2.5 (Receptive) changing to 8 (union/holding together).I'm not great at interpretation but here are some ideas...holding it together brings good fortune?being discreet/reserved keeps me held together?I should be receptive to keeping our friendship together?I'm not sure what I am meant to hold together.  Please help!"
2699,"Dear Forum friends,I asked how to best approach a person and got hex 6 with lines 2, 4 and 6 becoming hex 8. It's a bit confusing to me the advice to approach someone with conflict? Or is it a warning to avoid conflict? I really thank you in advance if someone could help me understand this answer...:bows:"
2700,"So this may be overkill but I'm at a crossroads and the information I have received from the Yi in this set of answers seem really pertinent to where I need to be going. I feel like the Yi is trying to get me to see something. or is trying to get a very direct message across and these readings have really given me the feeling that there is somewhere to go from here (which gives me a lot of relief and hope cause I have been stuck in it for a really long time). Many of the hexagrams are repeated so I feel that they are intertwined into one focus that I need to see more clearly. So here I am, asking for more clarity.This first question is kinda a desperate attempt to find some footing in my situation but it seems to be relevant so here it is.Please make the situation between me, A and B make sense. 25.1.3.6 to 31.Please show me an old mode of thinking or perception that no longer serves me or that I need to rid myself of in order to find resolution in my situation in my love life now. 24.1.5 to 8.What perspective should I replace this old one with? 24.1 to 2.What is this new perception referring to? 36.1.3 to 2. (I'm a little unsure myself on what I meant by this question but I think that I am looking for clarity on what I need to return to).How should I start putting this new perspective into action? 17.1 to 45.Who should I communicate with (communicate referring to the actions in line 17.1)? 17.1.3 to 31.In two readings 24 is the first hex, as well as 17 in two other readings, and two readings end in 31 and two more end in 2 so it seems like everything is kind of interconnected or is the Yi just trying to drill something into my ignorant skull?If you want/need more background go here.http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=7656 Thanks again for any and all input."
2701,"Hi Everyone,I met a man through a dating site who I have exchanged great emails with, had nice conversation and shared pics etc.He told me that he would come to my city to meet me but ended up not coming for reasons that, after consideration, I saw were quite valid.So this Monday he called me and talked to me for 90 minutes (he did most of the talking and sounded quite excited) he told me that he would call me more this week because he ""was sure that he would want to hear my voice more often"". But then instead of calling, he emailed and texted me (not the same to me).He wrote to me that he is trying to arrange his agenda to come see me and that it is ""top priority"". But then last night he sent me a mobile msg that he was in Geneva ""with friends for the night"" (he lives in France). Around 9 am this morning he sent me a mobile message saying ""Good morning beautiful lady"" I wrote back ""why don't you call me to say that? It would have an even nicer effect"".No reply.In fact he is inconsistent. I once called him and he texted back that he couldn't take the call because he was in Marseille with friends. Sorry but when a man is into a girl, he takes her call even for a minute, even with friends..unless of course, that ""friend"" is another woman.So I asked the I ching..""Why is X so inconsistent with me?""It answered 54.1.2 The Marrying MaidenNine at the beginning means:The marrying maiden as a concubine.A lame man who is able to tread.Undertakings bring good fortune.Nine in the second place means:A one-eyed man who is able to see.The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.Leading to 16 EnthusiasmWhat do you think this means? It's quite confusing."
2702,For an upcoming vacation from work I have decided to go on a spiritual retreat.  I've narrowed down the choices to three different retreats.  I asked the I-Ching these questions:1)  What would be the effect of me going on retreat A?40.1 into 542)  What would be the effect of me going to retreat B?61.1 into 593)  What would be the effect of me going to retreat C?7.2 into 2Any thoughts on which sounds the best?  All interpretations would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

2704,"Hi - I've posted before regarding a work relationship which was positive and negative- Regardless, I left it. I consider it often, and have asked previously what do about it, and received, a reading I and others interpreted as: let it go. I'm moving forward, and still thinking about this, and decided to ask again. My question was: do I reach out to this person, let it go? What's best for me? I received 11-46, which I feel is positive and suggests reaching out. Has anyone else experienced this-I know, now might be a good time, but I'm confused. Does anyone have insight? Thanks"
2705,"Hello, I drew 5.2 changing to 63 when I asked how a guy I am interested in ""sees"" me. He is a hard guy to understand to begin with so I just wanted a little insight into the situation and the result seems odd. line 2 of hex 5 talks about being gossiped about. I realize that everyone gets gossiped about at some point, there is no avoiding it, but I was startled by this! I can't seem to figure out if the I Ching is trying to tell me that he has heard some gossip about me (this is not good!) or that he himself is the one gossiping about me (even worse!)? I have no idea what the gossip is about if there is any...Or is there any other possible interpretation for this line, does it always refer to someone who is being talked about?"
2706,I asked the I Ching about 2 people that I care about: one that I have very firm feelings for and one whom I have very strong feelings for.  I asked the I Ching how appropriate the first guy (firm feelings) is in my life and got 47.2.5 to 16.I asked the same question for the one that I have strong feelings for and got 37.1.3.5 to 23.  I asked the I Ching if my strong feelings are just an obsession for me and the answer was 29.5 to 7.Then i asked for the reason why I am not so in love with the other guy (that I have firm feelings for) and the answer was 54.1.2.4 to 2.What can I get out of these readings? Thank you.
2707,"There is a children's book I recall from my own childhood, called ""Are you my mother?""the story of a little bird who gets lost and asks every animal in the forest if it is its mother. He doesnt yet know how to recognize her.My questions to the Yi bear a resemblance because usually I'm asking what someone's role is, why they have suddenly appeared. This is that sort of question too. A man just appeared in my life. We've met only once but have a friendship of sorts. I would personally like much more.Q: Show me a picture of X's role in my life.A: 30.1 and 56.He is a radiant flame but a wanderer, just passing through. Is that correct? What is the symbol of the cow? Or is the Yi flipping this around and saying I am the flame? Does this imply unreliable, a fire that flicker and then burn out without warning?Q: What does he most want from me now?A: 34.4 Power of the Great -> 11 Peace.Line 4 = Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. The hedge opens; there is no entanglement. Power depends upon the axle of a big cart. ""Righteous persistence is duly rewarded"" -- persistence, in what?Q: What does marriage mean to X? (out of curiosity, wanted to know what he is looking for now)A: 28.1.5 and 34line 1: To spread white rushes underneath. No blame.line 5:  A withered poplar puts forth flowers. An older woman takes a husband. No blame. No praise.(having trouble with these two lines)Image of 34: Thunder in heaven above: The image of The Power of the Great.Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths That do not accord with established order.He would want a traditional, ordered marriage, or sees it in a traditional way?Many thanks in advance for any input on these readings."

2709,Hey guys!I am thinking of getting into DJing. One of my pals has been really encouraging and is in the nightlife biz so I'd definitely have his support with the promotions.

I could obviously be WAY off base. he may have simply not renewed his membership..who knows.

So I asked If I was correct to believe he is in a relationship now?Answer 57.4 which REALLY confused me ""three kinds of game""? I have read in the shared readings that there is an element of something hidden in this line?so after hours of pondering...I asked the same question again (I'm being driven crazy thinking about this) and got.36.3 Karcher says that I find the central illusion that is causing chaos..does this mean this idea I have is just an illusion? and therefore false?Last edited: Apr 6, 2009"
2711,"Hi could any of you esteemed senior members  shed light on the 19 hexagram leading to 46? i.e. 19 changing at lines 1 and 3I just had an audition for a short film and I asked the I Ching whether the director was impressed with me and if I would get the part. And I got 19.1.3 i.e. leading to 46.19. Judgement""Approach has supreme success.Perseverance furthers.When the eighth month comes,There will be misfortune.""....am confused about the eight month and misfortune, when the rest of the judgement is positive i.e.....    ""Nine at the beginning means:    Joint approach.    Perseverance brings good fortune.""   ""Six in the third place means:    Comfortable approach.    Nothing that would not further.    If one is induced to grieve over it,    One becomes free of blame.""(don't understand the last 2 lines except that maybe I'm supposed to acknowledge that I might have done something wrong, or perhaps not my best, in the audition???? and then I will be relieved of any blame/error)Then 46...Judgement""Pushing upward has supreme success.One must see the great man.Fear not.Departure toward the southBrings good fortune.""So that seems really positive.The only further info I can give is that I briefly met this guy when I helped out on one of his short films 2 years ago. He also knows of me from around the acting and filmmaking traps and seemed very excited that I had applied to audition and that he was going to meet me again (i.e. I felt he respected me in that sense). So that was always an encouraging sign. Because I also do some writing and directing I'm just not sure if he wanted to make the connection (as people do in this industry) and possibly as a way to work together down the track, or whether he really wanted me for this part. Furthermore he reckons he was overwhelmed with applications to audition but only chose a very short list, of which I was obviously one. So again, to begin with, that was a great sign.Any help interpreting this would be much appreciated thankssofia "
2712,"Good morning I need a little help with a reading today.

I asked ""Should I go to the event?"" and got 21.3.621.3 I think this says I will be humiliated but there is no blame in this, which would make sense as he was the one who hurt me, not the other way around21.6 I have read several translation for this, either I will be punished if I go or I am not listening to the warnings? Is this a direct NO as answer to my question?to provide more insight I asked what should I expect to happen if i go and got 20.4.5.6 changing to 16i feel like 20.4 is saying all will go well but 20.5 and 20.6 don't exactly seem to fit in with the question I have a few days to make a decision so I want make sure I'm thinking clearly and right now I need a little help with that!

2715,"Nearly 6 weeks ago, while I was staying in the UK,  I sent a small parcel by registered post to a friend in Africa. The parcel has still not arrived and I am beginning to get restive about it.  I have sent parcels there before and they arrived, albeit usually with some delay. This delay is longer than I was expecting. The last parcel I had sent took only 2 weeks (that was quick). I can't do anything about this parcel now - it's left my hands: and it's a surprise for my friend so I've not talked about it. In any case, the usual answer by the postal service in that country to tracking inquiries is ""no sign yet"" until an item actually turns up!I want to know if the parcel will arrive soon. I drew 28, 1.2. >> 49I think that's a yes - especially 28.2.  To be honest, I am surprised to draw that hexagram for that question! I can't really see the excess in the situation, except perhaps it's telling me my worry is excessive (and that would be odd, as I do think about it, but not excessively!). I am stumped by 28.1 in this context. I'm also surprised by 49, unless it means that the situation will be completely overturned and the missing parcel will turn up. Or maybe it refers to the parcel itself causing a transformation in my friend, by virtue of its surprise and contents.  Any ideas?"
2716,"I was wrongly fired from my job for what I believe to be discriminatory reasons due to a disability I have, and have filed an appeal. A court date has been assigned, and I have recently read the forms filed by my ex-employer, in which my old supervisor is lying, saying I did not disclose my disability to her. I was wondering if I should just give up on the whole thing, since it comes down to her word(and she is prepared to lie) against mine. I hate confrontation. Thanks."
2717,"This is going to be very vague but that means I just expect vague assistance which is ok with me because sometimes thats what I need.  I have a tendency to look too closely at every detail that when someone gives me a general overview or a holistic idea of a situation, something clicks or becomes clearer for me so any feedback is appreciated.I have been feeling like I have been doing a lot of waiting in the recent past and that now I am nearing a crossroads so my very vague question was ""Where should I go from here?"" Answer=33.4.6 to 39Ok, obviously I need to willingly retreat from something even though it will lead to hardship.Then I asked ""Who or what should I retreat from?"" Answer=44.1.2.4.5.6 to 36This creates some confusion.  I read this like a series of events and that makes sense because events in a certain area of my life read similar to the moving lines in 44 and the resulting line of 36.  What I am unsure of is am I suppsoed to retreat from the person that the 44 represents or is it saying that I should stop darkening my light now?  I haven't been with this person for almost a year now because of outside circumstances but we have talked at times throughout and both still feel very strongly about the other.  I don't know if I am supposed to retreat from the situation as a whole, namely 44>36, and stop hiding my feelings and waiting to be with him, or if I am supposed to retreat from the person which would cause me to have to hide (or deny) my feelings for him which means I should darken my light.  44 isn't really seen as a positive hexagram for relationships but there is part of Wilhelm's translation that sounds mroe hopeful.""Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result""                                                                                        -WilhelmAlso this thread made so much sense to me, at least in this case.  http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=2649Finally I asked ""What is the proper action to take towards successfully accomplishing this retreat?"" Answer=35.6 to 16.I guess this means I need to just do it and be enthusiatic about it but not forceful.Any takers? "

2720,"I just put in an application for a new apartment. It was a stressful process, lots of forms to fill out and a big deposit to fork over. It will be a big change too: a new environment, a different culture, needing a roommate after living alone for years. Still, I thought I'd feel relief once I'd finally taken the plunge. Instead, I'm full of fear, stress, and doubt.I asked the I Ching what I need to know now that I've committed to this apartment and received 37.4 > 13. I checked the Clarity archives for this reading and noticed an odd coincidence. In one case, the questioner had a pretty good life and good friends but still felt they were too lazy and lethargic. In another, the questioner had given a good presentation to their local school board, but still felt sad and uncomfortable about the whole thing.  Both had gotten this reading when they had no real reason to feel bad or inadequate but did anyway.I'd like to think the I Ching is saying that my own fears about fitting into this new community, making new friends, and attracting a good roommate, are illusory too, but I know how easy it is to read into the response what I want to hear, instead of hearing what the reading has to say. I still feel like I'm really not up to all this, and I don't want to miss any insight the I Ching may be offering."
2721,"I've gotten hex.19 unchanging as answer to a question if a particular wish of mine could  or not be fulfilled; this answer is very uncertain to me because I'm not so at ease about that eighth month the text of the hexagram is talking about, so i go further in my questionning :'how should i understand hex.19 regarding the chance my wish to come true?"" and the new answer is 36.4-55;now the I Ching seems very clear:you will give up your wish just before it would  be possible to make it real because you will realise it wouldnt't be good for youwhat do you think? is hex. 19 a good sign for a successful plan , could  the misfortune announced for the eighth month be overcome or the  second answer i cast reveals the real outcome?"

2726,"I am having the strangest repeat occurrence. About a month ago, I was woken abruptly around 3 am to firm and loud knocking, as though on my window or door.  No one was there.  I felt the sense that it was a warning of some kind that after a brief reprieve from D, that he was coming to me and I should prepare myself.  Sure enough, two days later he showed up standing over my bed in the middle of the night.Yesterday, I couldn't chase him from popping in my mind over and over and I had to really work at pushing those thoughts away.  I asked the IC why I was suddenly thinking about him and what to expect next in that situation.  I received 31 unchanging.So last night, I was woken by three sharp, firm, loud knocks at 3:15 AM.  I checked the front door:  no one.  Checked the windows: no one.  I am afraid this is another warning, but at the least, it's a very scary experience in general to be woken by something so clear and loud, to again find  nothing is doing it?!!?I asked IC to help me understand the knocking and I received 23.1.3.4 changing to 30.  This makes sense to me as it seems to be all about removing and separating.  That is what this situation is about now.  I'm hoping for more insight into this reading from the people here?Thank you:bows:"
2727,"Hello to all,Several days apart, I asked about the same situation (sadness over something that's leaving my life, and a sense that there's unused potential there that will never be realized). I was astounded to get this mirror reading:First 18.4 (repairing what is spoiled) to 50 (The cauldron)Then 50.4 to 18!I feel somehow the Yi is sending a strong message here. What is it? yes, indeed, the potential is wasted due to carelessness?makes me feel even sadder...any comments are very welcome. thank you!"
2728,"Hello, everyoneI hope you can help me out here. I had some troubles with my boss and my job got jeopardized. When we spoke about these things we were in colflict and my boss said that he decided that he would not prolong my contract which expires in the end of this jear. I let the situation cool down and me and my boss have been going along great, we reestablished the bond, the climate is very nice and pleasant...but we never discussed my contract again and now I don't know what to expect. I am still hoping he will change his mind because I would like to keep this job.I asked Yi Jing: will my boss extend my contract?I got 25.2 - which is about going with the flow, not doing anything with any agenda...So i read this as ""let it be"" and all will be well in the end.But still I feel I need to clarify some things with my boss, talk to him about some issues - becuase he said that this job was not challenging enough for me, that I needed someting better - but I am happy here and I want to tell him that!So, I asked Yi Jing: should I talk to my boss?I got 14 unchanging. I guess it would be a good thing?I am not sure how to read these two hexagrams...on one hand I feel I should just let it be and keep this relationship easy and flowing - on the other hand I feel I need to clarify some things, but I am afraid that I might ruin things if I open some stuff...I am confused and going over this in my head - can you help with some advice, please?Thanks!"
2729,"So the title is a pun, I couldn't resist.For some months, I've been in a romantic relationship - my first - with someone I adore more than I thought possible. Today, he told me that he's not in love with me anymore. Needless to say, the emotional agony is unbearable, especially given that I'm already receiving psychotherapy for suspected dysthymia/moderate depression. Seeking guidance, I looked to the I Ching. Unsure what to ask, I asked the thing I most wanted to know - ""How can I recover from this agony?""The answer came as hexagram 31 changing to hexagram 39. I read this as ""influence"", which I understand as working both ways - 31 means both being open to influence and being able to influence, right? - changing to, or resulting in, difficulty in proceeding. I can't quite understand the course of action that it's suggesting. Initially, I reacted by asking another question - this time, I asked why, whenever I ask about my emotional wellbeing, it suggests that there will be difficulty proceeding in the future. It answered with 11 changing to 16. I took this to mean that it answered the way it did because the ""difficulty"" it spoke of was the loss of the ""little things that seem big"" - the sort that flow away in hexagram 11 to make way for things of real significance; and that overcoming this difficulty would result in the vast potential for creative energy suggested by hexagram 16 - the enthusiasm that seems to be the opposite of depression. I could only assume that it meant that the relationship wasn't as big as it seemed, and it's been telling me all along that it had to go, that I had to focus on other things to recognise the greatness in them, or to make myself open to something better.(Gosh, I've rambled much more than I intended to - sorry.)Now, in light of this, I looked at my first reading again. Do you think I'm right in interpreting the ""difficulty"" of hexagram 39 as the loss of the so-called ""small things"" (I still can't think of that relationship as being insignificant)? Is the I Ching suggesting that I have to open myself up to external influences and attempt to direct things myself? I'm not sure quite what to make of this reading, but there seems to be something in it. Is there something I'm missing? Can anyone provide some insight? I'm fairly new to this, if it wasn't obvious from the above.Thanks."
2730,"I asked the Yi ""Do you see a new healthier partner entering my life?""I received 18.2.3 >23I have previously inquired here about the possibility of a reconciliation with my prior partner who abruptly left our relationship to have a relationship with himself. He is living a very, simple, financially restricted, quiet life. He is not making any direct approach to me, not contactning me nor outwardly expressing any hope for a rebuilding, but has consistently professed that he loves me. We run into each other and have talked off and on over the past year and a half.  He is aware that I love him. The separation/loss of partnership has been incredibly painful to me. He has said he does not have anything to offer me and likes his simple life right now. He has chosen good work with limited responsibility and very limited income. He is well educated.  Recently he told me he finds his simple and unattached life more in balance.  It seems he is not choosing to meet me. I have experience deep grief over this ending and have done much emotional/spiritual work about the levels of attachment and depth that this loss triggers. I tried a friendship with him; it was too painful without emotional commitment. Many people encourage me to move on.My last Yi Ching inquiries/feedback suggested waiting with a positive outlook for reforming with my ex-. Yet,due to the length of time and lack of overture or sign from my former partner, I asked the above question.The reply: 18.2.3 suggests making an effort to heal what is damaged, to restore things the way you want them to be, making things right, not pressing too hard, not being too energetic or too quick.Changing to 23...Shedding, splitting a part, stripping away the outmodedfinding the middle way, sitting tight, persevering, waiting it out, avoiding action, letting go of being sensitive to how others respond...not intervening.I found the reply to my question about a new relationship, pointing me back to healing the old one, trusting the process, waiting through this separation period, without a suggestion about a new partnership. Does my interpretation make sense to others?I would like feedback as to how those more experienced with the I Ching and with more detachment, interpret the reply.Thanks."
2731,"Hello all,I decided to go thru with the appeal which will probably begin next week since it will be a working day. I just wanted to know the outcome before I start, due to anxious anticipation. There is a force 'larger' than me that sort of pushes it; this issue's been draggin' for a long time, just because I know the difficulties in doing something like that.So I asked the I ching, will I obtain what I want from the appeal eventually? (because, if I dont get what I want, whats the use of appealing?)The Iching gave me an answer, 44.2.4>53. The changing lines look like the devil's churning in the mix, but 53 presents progress. I am not sure if it is saying yes, it will give me what I want? Or, no, it won't, and I should just drop it, because there is ""no fish in the tank"". I will progress after that.Nine in the fourth place means:No fish in the tank.This leads to misfortune.Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep them well disposed. Then we can make use of them if we should need them. If we become alienated from them and do not meet them halfway, they turn their backs on us and are not at our disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault.What does this mean, and who are insiginifcant people? They seem to be clues for something. In any case, I have already decided to go thru with the appeal. The ball won't be in my court any longer."
2732,"Hello everybody!I hope you can help me to understand a situation I am experiencing... Basically I felt a big disappointment when I knew I had to wait longer than I was expecting for something I have been to happen with intensity. Lately things were going just as I wanted them so, this delay really surprised me, and while I feel somehow that this delay is not as bad as I took it, at the same time the feeling of disappointment grew bigger and brought some doubts (or fears) that I am still coping with. Just to see more clearly what is going on I asked to the I Ching a few questions and so far I felt that whatever it is, I should chill out... I'm chilling out now, but I would appreciate your help and views on these responses so perhaps I can understand better what's going on and chill out more! This situation involves a person (of course!) and while I was hoping we could meet right now, he has arranged to meet next week instead. Well, it doesn't seem a catastrophe but suddenly I felt that he might have postponed me, or he was avoiding me, ... basically I felt  unwanted. Well, I asked the I Ching the following: What is behind this situation? 26.6, changing to 11.What's the current situation? 53.5, changing to 52.Why our meeting was set for more than a week later? 5.3.5 changing to 19.What's going on to him about me? 34.2.5, changing to 49.Well, thanks for your help!Last edited: Mar 30, 2009"

2734,"Hello again Just wanted to share this one; because the relevance just blows me away (though I am continually blown away )Well, in my life, whenever I have felt wronged by someone I've covered it up - unfortunately allowed the bullies to make me feel I brought it on myself, rather than seeing that it's just their problem.  Basically I'm always outwardly nice regardless, can't express the anger I may feel, which must come across as fake sometimes, or at least lacking a backbone Do I need to discipline my niceness?21.2,4 > 41Well that says it all - highlighting the importance of administering justice (what kind of world would we be living in if everyone glossed over injustices and criminal behaviour?)21.2> It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case.. But one encounters ahardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little toofar. The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bitesignifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility. However,there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is just.Saying sometimes anger is needed, however uncomfortable.21.4> There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary to be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties. If one knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune. The difficult task is achieved in the end.So again, should be acknowledged and not shyed away from.But then, 41 is about sacrificing the self for the whole?  So maybe at the same time saying don't take everything to heart so much and harbour resentment (more self damagaing) Maybe 41 is saying not everyone is bad, but there are definitely still opponents to be aware of.  In another shared reading I read this : 41 relinquishes individual benefit for the sake of the whole, or in other words, think beyond yourself. That is the offered sacrifice. In this case that could say 'consider the benefit to everyone if you go, not limiting the consideration to you or the person you'd like to avoid.' Then good fortune comes. BUT if you do come up against opponents, don't back down, bite through...As I understand 21 its a time when you are advised to take corrective action if someone has abused you in any way - its not a time to sit back and let it go. However line 2 did suggest you may be being just a little harsh, and as others have said 41 does advise a reduction in negative emotions. We'll see what happens..:bows:"

And yet isn't getting resolved. But I have been so positive and okay with the situation and excited about my life and goals for quite a while now, so this sudden hit of depression is a bit confounding (unless it's hormonal!)The Karcher book says.....31.2 - don't make any hasty moves or be taken in by this powerful feeling. Just stay right where you are and you'll soon have what you want31.4 - a very favourable influence. You go back and forth in your thoughts trying to understand this new feeling. Have no fears. Your friends will be there for you31.5 - a very deep connection that will endure over time. You are feeling the beginnings. This will wipe away past sorrows31.6 - ""mouth is loosened and bursts forth"" i.e. the influence inspires you and you burst forth in passionate speeach.

I have other friends here etc and it would be good to say bye and have some sort of celebration since I've been here a long time and have had good times (even with my housemates - just living together was a mistake...)I asked should I leave earlier and bow out of this party? 12.2 > 6It could be fun and good but whether it's right all things considered... maybe I should just depart and retain my dignity - acknowledge the lack of friendship.. but that might be worse when it comes to it..12.2 initially I thought meant bring my idea to a standstill, because it could just be running away, but then maybe I should not 'mingle with the crowd of the inerior'... but then maybe I should just ride it out : 'by his willingness to suffer personally he insures the success of his fundamental principles'.. hmm, but maybe that's saying I should leave to protect myself from, a 'fake sentiment' party.. but maybe I shouldn't take it so seriously and just go with it.. last hurdle..It would be good to say bye and other friends will hopefully come along.. I like them as people it just hasn't worked out and they're making no efforts to hide that... by treating me indifferently and moving out.. but then maybe I should just fight for my right to party? (despite underlying awkwardness... more a celebration of me leaving really - a release for us all..) How would you take 12.2 > 6?Thanks anyone that has some advice :bows:Last edited: Mar 27, 2009"
2740,"Hello everyone,this is my first post and i am very excited i hope i am doing this right.Actually i didnt wanna post my question here cuz i like to getting to understand my questions myself, i like trying to figure them out and trying to be objective. The thing is it is about a guy and i know i shouldnt be with him cuz it is just not right ad he is not a right guy for me, but you know how it feels... Something deep inside always asks ""wha if we were together?""... anyways i have seen this guy for several times, at first he was very nice to me and he told my friend that he liked me and i am very sweet and all but he wouldnt think of a relationship (because he works in a different country and he will leave in a month or two) so he is not thinking anything serious.I have been sleeping with this guy for three weeks and it was all nice and i didnt have a problem with it, and it wasnt just sex, we were hanging out and talking about things that are important for us and he loved to cuddle and sleep, so i thought it wasnt just sex, maybe he has a little feelingy thing too. but three weeks ago we just stopped talking, we havent talked at all, not even a text message. So i asked and i dont even know why i asked this question cuz i really dont see my self dating him or being his gf but okay i asked if we are gonna be together as in having a real relationship and the answer is 46.1 going to 11...The weird thing is that this seems kinda positive to me, i have always considered 11 as a positive answer... i always feel that hexagram 11 supports me on the thought, but i am not very sure about 46.1 so any ideas are welcome And ıone more i asked if he will all me in two weeks and i got 42.6 changing to 3 and what i got from this is that there will be a good time where it will be positive and he might actually call me, but it will a short period of time and i should use it wisely, probably cuz he will leave or i dunno i am so afraid of admitting myself maybe i like him? and 3 is that this period is difficult and it is not giving me any space to breathe but if i can get through this there will be good at the end, good meaning we wont talk at all or good meaning he will call me and we will talk... i really dunno... but i hope the best is ahead of me and preparing itself "
2741,"Hello everyone,as it is seen on the topic this ones about job, actually a partnership that my mom wants to start. There is this guy from the company that she works and he wants to start a bussiness with my mom, he has graduated from best colleges and all but somehow i dont trust him, he is the type of person that would get bored of everything easily and that is very impatient.So i asked if this partnership would be any good for my mom and got hex. 9 unchanging.I read what Hilary wrote and it said ""a time where the power is gathering but its not yet time to act"" and in Richard Rutt the translation says ""having no backing"" they really dont seem to have any backing right now. Hilary also wrote that in time there will be rain, but it is hard to believe for me since i dont really trust this guy.Would you help me please, as you always do D."
2742,"Hello everybody!!!Thank you very much for putting up with the last week, you all were very nice to me.Now i have another question, i actually found this one on the site, i would never make up this question by myself. I like reading through the threads about the lines i like and in one of these someone asked this question and i really liked it so i decided to ask it myself. And the answer made me laugh... really The question is: How do i appear to men generally?The answer is 3 with lines 1 and 5 going to 2...Does this mean that they first see me as a cold bi**h and than as they get to know me, i am not that bad.Difficulty at the beginning is a very funny and true answer indeed  i appear very cold and distant at first but once you start talking to me, i am not that bad Any ideas?Much Love...D."
2743,Hey guys!I asked about a special someones feelings towards me who has just returned into my life following a disappearance act after trying to woo me. Tis the horse that ran off towards the full moon I wrote about earlier. In my previous post I asked if he was the one and received 11 changing to 55.Now the I Ching answered with 32.1.2 to 55Any thoughts?
2744,"Hello,I asked 2 questions and got 2 unchanging hex for each…First question was: what can i expect from C? Answer: 8And second question: what do I need to know about C? Answer: 35.Bluntly I would think this means that I can expect union and a blossoming future with C however I am not sure it is as simple as this…That is why I kindly ask for your experienced opinions for which I gratefully thanks in advance.Rony"
2745,"First of all I would like to say to everyone! I've been observing this website for a few months now. I do my own readings and pop on here for more of an insight to what I may have missed in my own interpretation. I'm really nothing but an amateur compared to you all!  What I was hoping for is to have some help with a reading please. I have been seeing this guy off and on for the last year no commitments which I would wish to have with him but have never told him this, but he does know I like him alot. We have slept together a couple times and he has met my kids, and we have hung out a few times. Everybody likes him. I just don't know where I stand. Should I forget about him or wait?  My question is 1) What are we meant to be to each other? I recieved 25.52) What does he feel for me now? I received 20.2.5If someone could please clarify this I would appreciate it so much! Thanks in Advance!"
2746,"thanks for the previous helps here about the decision to break up and how to read it. the helps encourages me to follow my guts.I have been going through breaking up with the partner. I will move out asap to the other place. Even I am visiting him and don't have my own place here. Of course a lot of emotions, but I still feel good that I did it and spoke out some feelings, even maybe some are exaggerated and some still unable to articulate.Even though I try to be calm and not hurtful to each other, but I know it is unavoidable. Since some issues cannot be changed immediately, I feel what I can do just terminate it. Even the past was still beautiful.the trust already dies out in me because of ignorance in the long-distance and open relationship. and also he is in the situation of his  empty (because he doesn't really know what to pursue or how and what he wants to do for his career) and changing period in his career and jobs. This part seems to show me how he deal with the responsibility and life priorities.I asked iching:  what is the lesson here in breaking-up this relationship? 28.1.2.3.6>2528.1 to be caution to initiate and jump into the relationship 28.2 (don't know how to read this line) does it indicate the period when I got together with this person?28.3 the moment the structure of the relationship collapses 28.6 there are something more important than this relationship's life?25 innocenceIs it read as a context for the changing lines or as a result?If it is read as a context, does it mean that I jump into this relationship was naive and too impulsive without full consideration, so this relationship could help me think what do I want from a relationship and how it can work.But are there more specific points about the lesson?   because there are 4 moving lines, I don't really know how to read them. please help,thank you,:bows:"
2747,"Hi all,I got 1.3 twice in the last couple of days, when asking about a person, which I think speaks for itself - I probably excessively think of him and relate certain new understandings in relationships, and life - to him.  I guess I'm still trying to unerstand the nature of the relationship and how, and why he influenced me so much.  Though not apparent now.I am at peace with the reality of the situation, and I know relationships shouldn't be probed too much with the Yi - because what will be will be - if it's right it just is and I am aware of that   But with the detachment I now feel, I'd be really grateful for some help with these readings.Is there now a void between us?57.1,2,3,5,6 > 24Excessively trying to influence has led to a return to the self, or would you read that as the relationship will?Is he going to get in touch?49.1 > 31.1I don't mind either way now and the more time goes on the more I start to think he was just a learning curve   But I feel grateful for having met him as it led to discovering good new things etc.. but how should this be read.  Thoughts of action not executed?  Or perhaps indicating I am gearing towards a change in perception - perhaps towards the decrease of his presence in my thoughts?Ahh.. perhaps a desire to rid an obligation?How important is my existence to him?52.1,2,4 > 14Hmm... seems good but perhaps this is all a matter of timing etc.  Thanks for reading any impressions would be good because my head still lacks clearage.:bows:"
2748,"Dear all, could you help me these readings about the relationship?with respect, what can I expect to keep working on this long-distance and open relationship?29.3>4829.3 means that it is not good to be indecisive with hesitations back and forth. It is better to step back and wait or sort of pause the development of this relationship.If I keep working on this relationship, the result is 48. But I don't understand what does it mean?with respect, what can I expect that to terminate this relationship gradually? 32.4>4632.4 ""no game in the field"" means right now in the relationship, it seems very empty and hollow. It seems not point to keep playing this game.  46 means stand up for myself and a good sign to terminate this relationship. with respect, what can I expect that to stay in this relationship?28.3>47 28.3 it seems that the foundation of this relationship already ""sags to the breaking point."" The conditions of this relationship (long-distance, asked to become an open relationship, and other communication or environment and people) already start to break down and rotten. 47. to keep relationship will lead to exhaustion.How to read that I got 46 and 47 in these related questions?In my understanding, Iching is saying to break up rather than keep working on the relationship right? I am new and thanks for any :bows:helpsally"

2750,"dear all,I asked the same question twice: ""What can I do to keep the magic and spark alive in my partnership?"" and received the same hexagram, Development, twice:First 53.1 to 37 (The Family)Then 53.4,6 to 31 (Influence)I have to admit both readings made me smile, because they seemed to suggest a combination of stability, familial warmth and attraction between us, and that's an ideal package if ever I've seen one. But now that we've gotten through a big storm and are in a lovely phase again, I don't want us to get into a rut, and I can feel the force of habit and routine coming on. Just want to make sure I do my part to keep the relationship alive and exciting and not take this love for granted. From that point of view, what is the YI saying? All of your help is, as always, appreciated!"
2751,"I have been casting the Yi about my current work, but there are many things coming and I don't know if Yi's answers are directed to my job or to all that bounch of things.  Me and My daughter are working at the same place. We are teachers in a private school. My daughter is getting married to a wonderful boy from another country in 3 months, but they are planing to stay in my country to see how things go; if things don't go as expected then they will go to my daughter's fiance's country in Europe (maybe I'll be moving there too. On the other hand we both have plans with a thirth party to start a new school on our own In my country. Anyways we want to keep our current job the same while we get all ready for our new plans. For the next year I have very nice plans for my students (I have 9 groups under my charge). I was told that in this school they let you know before summer vacations if you will continue working with them or not. So, I started asking Yi  ""What will happen with our work in this school? I received 42 no changing, but I wanted to know more and asked the same question. I received 56.3.6 Then I asked for more and got 27.2.4 >38 so, It became dull to me. I am perseverant  so I asked again and received 56 no changing. As I thought Yi was not answering my question, this time just asked what will happen if I tell the principal my plans? and got 56 no changing... again?!! Could you please help me?Thanks a lotps I have been reading you all for 2 or 3 years and became a fan of many of you..I almost fell in love (in a respectfull manner) with Willowfox and the way he or she interprets the Yi. Is he or her ok?  I hope so."
2752,"Ok..My question was; ""Should I move to North Carolina in Sept for sexual Qigong training/ certification"". The I-ching gave me 50 moving lines on the 1st and 4th going into 26.Now the general situation is; I'm 18, broke, but I want to pursue this as a path. My current teacher said she'll respect my decision but doesn't agree with it, saying I can't understand the I Ching till I'm @ least 40, asking ""do you know how to count?"". So reality is if I do follow this path, I'll be living on my own etc. when I move.Sidenote; I did numerous readings generally around the same question; and they all said the same thing basically; just differently. Like someone's outside view though since I'm not very good with the I-Ching and this is a major decision."
2753,"Folks,We got some really disturbing news yesterday.  My husband's stepmother has decided she's going to sue him for all the gifts his father gave him while he was alive (he passed in November 08).We consulted with a lawyer who basically told us this was ""pathetic and ridiculous"" that you can't sue for gifts given, but also indicated that it might not stop her from trying to pursue the case.The reason for doing this was quite sinister - my husband's real mother (divorced from his father some time ago) has a claim on the estate that is legitimate and is going to court now.  We know this is a scare tactic to try and get her to back down, but she really can't afford to do that.  Nor do we think she should.However, I am 6.5 months pregnant and my husband is quite ill and we really don't need this in our lives right now.  I consulted the iChing and have received 39 unchanging, which appears to mean - you're blocked, chill out and wait.  I am interpreting that as, no amount of trying to get the stepmother to stop this will work, we just need to wait and see if she files and then hire a really great lawyer to stop this in its tracks.Thoughts?MM"
2754,"This is my first time sharing in this type of community, though I have done I Ching readings over the years. I am interested in your feedback and how community input may help me benefit and use the I ching.I asked what the future would bring regarding my relationship with my former partner. He left a 4 year long relationship to ""have a relationship with himself."" This aburpt heartbreaking ending occurred about 1 1/2 years ago. He has said he chose to leave as he did not have enough to offer me,  that he was being destructive to the relationship and that things would get worse if he stayed. He said he needed to work on being in relationship with himself, rather than trying to please others. There were obstacles to our relationship, but it a very powerful loving connection. We were excellent companions and lovers, and shared many interests. We both believed we had found our life partner. Some of our difficulties around his lack of career and money, and some core heart level work that we both needed to do. He is not seeking another relationship but living a very solitary existence. We tried a friendship over the summer/fall last year, about 6 months following the separation, but it was not satisfying without a clear partnership and emotional intimacy. I am moving on with my life, but I still feel a very strong connection with this man and hope for him to to turn things around. We accidently ran into each other on what would have been our fifth anniversary in January. With the help of the i ching I have learned to withdraw from making any overtures, and am trusting more in the things I can not control. My heart is still open to this man, and I am also prepared to move on. I asked the I ching:What will the future bring with J. and I...I received the following response40.1.4.5.6 >61I welcome and appreciate your insights. Thank you"

This has left me feeling a little torn- I'm obviously better off without this whole situation in my life, and on the other hand, I feel a loss, and a little angry at myself for being so judgemental.

Basically I am the one who is the unhappier one i.e i just feel he has not changed and he will always be the same way( though he has changed a few things and that is more related to his taunting me on a few matters, that has stopped and also helping out more at home) but i do not think he cares, today i was not feeling well and i called him back from the gym and not once he came and asked how i was feeling and it got me thinking that he never does that !! i will be lying in the room sick and not once he will ask me how i was feeling, if i need anything or even come to look at me.  if i ask him to do something ofcourse he does that but never on his own initiative.i asked him and he got angry and said that i am always ill and i am jealous of him going to the gym and called him back. btw he is also laid off.i asked yi to tell me what to do about him stay with him or leave him ..i got 18.4.5 changing to 44look forward to your insights!!"

In response, there were : 62 (the small advances), which then turned to the changing lines in 55 (abundance).

He's doing fine now but I have been very worried about him...as expected.I asked a few questions and got the following answers:What do I need to know about his health?  53I understood this to mean that everything will go well.  It will, however, be a long process and not something that will happen overnight.  It will involve lifestyle changes that until now he has been unwilling to make.It also is about doing everything correctly and following ""the rules"".  I'm going to interpret this as meaning that he will need to follow a certain diet etc.What is his prognosis? 20.3.5 to 52A prognosis is a look toward the future.  I understood this answer to mean that there will be a lot of soul searching going on.  This is going to be a life changing experience for him.I also think there's a message here similar to that above.  He is going to have to follow ""the rules"" making real lifestyle changes.Other ideas would be much appreciated."
2761,"Dear Clarity friendsIn the last couple of weeks there has been an issue that has been puzzling me concerning an erroneous attitude or pattern of behavior on my part. I have the feeling that something is wrong but can't quite put my finger on it. So I went ahead and asked the Yi what I should do about it (it was rather a self-development question, not relating to any specific individual, more of a general nature).I got 40 unchanging.So far I've come up with three possible interpretations.(1)Past difficulties are giving way and release is at hand. If this interpretation is correct, rather than wait for release to come and find me, I think it is best to think of the answer in terms of ""it is timely to work to actually bring about release re. the issue.      In this case, I have to:(a) Make a complete break with the past, not dwell on it. (b) If there are no residual matters, return back to ordinary conditions asap.(c) If there are things that still need to get done, then take vigorous action to deal with them as quickly as possibly.(2)However, a second possible interpretation could be that I just need to relax about it, lighten up, loosen up, let it go. Meaning there's nothing (particularly) wrong with my attitude/behaviour so I should stop trying to analyze the whole thing.(3)A third possible interpretation could be that there is a real issue, yes, but if I just stop struggling with it, release it from my concerns, then things will just come together of their own accord (suddenly?). My gut feeling? All three interpretations could fit the answer and the issue at hand. Why not? But then again, might I be reading too much in this hexagram that isn't actually there?I'd welcome any suggestions from people who are more experienced than I am or who are just willing to have a go at it. [And is it possible that all three different interpretations could apply at the same time? Not likely I think but then, why not?]el_2"

I was not feeling confident in myself for some reason (probs hormonal)  And asked the Yi for how to deal with the occasion etc:Advice for the funeral?Hex 10 - made perfect sense for a funeral - treading respectfully and discreetly.Then, as I wanted to make a good impression on family members I han't seen since childhood - distant cousins etc -I asked How can I be more articulate and have presence?36. 1, 5, 6 > 53I think this may be saying darken my light by laying low while feeling down, hiding and allowing my confidence and sense of self gradually develop?

2765,"The Wilhelm translation and the imagery therein really inspired me yesterday.And encouraged me to realise the importance of the use of symbolism in the Yi - which before I hadn't really given as much value to as the words - but they can be a real help!I have started a work placement and had a brief chat with a man there who is attractive, but of course I have learnt and am not madly in love with him already But I asked the Yi about him, and received 29.5,6 > 4Which I immediately read as don't get carried away and take your (heart) into a danger zone ie unfounded romantic fantasies (Not that I was - don't feel a great connection) and just follow the line of least resistance (29.5) and of course to learn from the mistakes of past hastiness However, it then struck me that the Yi could also be reflecting something he told me - about visiting Canterbury and being told about the 'ducking' of women during witch hunts - they were put in a vessel of water - and if they drowned (well they drowned..) but if they survived they were deemed a witch and burnt alive   Doesn't bear imagining gosh the things humans have done So, I realsied the Yi could have been illustrating that he tought me (hex 4) the abysmal story of women being placed in a vessel 29.6 'filled to the brim' and 29.6 'bound with chords and ropes' !!Not nice eh.  But amazing - it does seem like the Yi was recounting the story don't you think!?:bows:"
2766,"ok i feel horrible, i keep saying i wont think about him and wont ask anything but at a moment of losing my mind i started yelling what do you want from me??? and at that moment i realized why dont i ask this question to i ching?

2767,"And so I have been reading the threads talking abt Saturn return year and Hex 28. I turn 29 this year.Previously having met P, and coming out of my singlehood, wanting to take a chance at dating and hoping to meet the right one, and seeing i liked what I felt, I asked if P was the one and got Hex 53(1,5,6) -->36. Then there was talk abt how if changing lines pertaining to a relationship Q were far apart, that was indicative of how far apart the couple in question were; another sign of differences. In conclusion, the verdict was 'does not bode well'.Months later after going thru all the ups and downs of emotions, I told Yi that I sincerely didnt think P was the one, and asked what she thought. She said 19(2)-->24Gave me a sneaking feeling someone else might be on the horizon and that was what was suggested in Shared readings as well.The very next day this other guy M whom I met at the same time as P saw me online and started chatting with me. I was travelling and happened to be in the same state as M. At the end of chat, he said that I shud hv told him I was there, and that he wud hv taken me out. I have been out of chat for 3 months, and had a feeling M thought he wud never see me again. Now chat has progressed, and I didnt do anything to ensure we'll be in touch. But M has gone on to ask for my number, and says he'll call me on Sat. He's also been hinting strongly that he wants to pay the state I live a visit.I know that the time frames are not meant literally, but Hex 24 says ""Your Friend comes...Return comes on the seventh day.."" and Sat is the 7th day from when I asked Yi.Ok not to get my hopes up, I asked Yi if M was the one. Cos that question seems to work for me. If it doesnt bode well, then I dont have to go thru months of not knowing Sorry for the long intro but here's my question. I asked Yi if M was the one.I got 28(2,6)-->33.Is this just another passing situation as well? uch: Sigh."

I thought it pointed to something positive, but I'm new to IChing and wanted to hear other people's interpretations.  Thanks!"

I am thinking that i shouldnt call him. Actually besides asking i-ching, i really dont wanna call him... Why do we have emotions? life would be easier without them... i think... i am not sure...D."
2770,"good morning all I wanted to share an interesting reading...I got a vedic astrology reading done and was astonished when I saw that my 27th year was marked out as one of my absolute worst. This really caught my attention because I am 27 and it has been my worst year ever with a lot of very traumatic ordeals! Luckily I am turning 28 next month and being curious I asked the I ching a few questionsI first asked if I will find immediate relief on my 28 th birthday and got 16.2 changing to 40I have never got this line before and after researching the forums I see it has a lot of conflicting interpretations so I'm not sure what that line means here . However, based on hex 40 I think this reading is suggesting yes I willmy vedic reading said nothing specific about my 28th year so I asked the I ching, what can I expect in my 28th year? I got 51.2.5 changing to 58this seems very conflicting to me, line 2 saying I will lose something and line 5 saying nothing is lost? I know there is some speculation about using the I ching to ""predict"" things but I think it's really trying to tell me something with this...maybe i will experience a shock that will lead to joy?If anyone has any thoughts on this, especially on line 2 of hex 16, I would love to hear them!"
2771,shock brings one success     good fortune  what exactlt does this mean please?
2772,"Hi,I met a aura / crystal master recently and he advised me to purchased this crystal, as it does cost abit hence i am asking iching for advice:""can i trust the master who read my aura today?""i got hex 6.3 leads to hex 44Can i trust this master?Thanks :bows:"
2773,"Hello, me again,I think it was yesterday, i asked a question about this guy and being together and i-ching gave me a very positive answer and i couldnt believe it so i thought i read it wrong or wrote the numbers and lines down all wrong. So i asked the question again and i got 22.3 going to 27this doesnt seem all that positive  to me and i think maybe i really made a mistake the last time  Any ideas?D."
2774,"So Ive been in contact with a former student (I was a grad student instructor) intermittently via email over the last year and a half. We met once, I left the country for the summer and upon returning she resumed contact after I thought it was over. But shes in a relationship. So I finally just ask her to meet me out after returning from 2 months meditation training and she tells me shed love to meet me but shes in couples counseling right now and she understands if Im put off. Id like to just meet her again in person at least once just to see things closer and leave it or go from there. There is a plan to meet up in a couple of days. So I asked the I Ching: What does X feel about me? 61 UnchangingCan X be trusted? 33.2 to 44What is your impression of this reading? Thanks for your help"
2775,"hello to you!i'm interested in 2 guys and i'm wondering about the possibility of a closer relationship with one of them (my idea is to find out if any of these guys could be my mate aiming to focus myself more on his person )so i ask (the same question ): shall i come to an intimate relationship with A.? (what 's the future about this?)         53.1-37shall i come to an intimate relationship with B.?(what's the future about this ?)35.1.2.5.6-58the first changing line of 53 is not a very ...loving one confused: ), it doesn't  promise a flourishing relationship i thinkthe 4 changing lines of 35 are confusing me but i figure 35 and 58 are good answers in relation matter    i need your interpretation !!!"
2776,"Hi folks,I'm supposed to be meeting a group. I asked what I stood to gain from this meeting and it was 11. The deal is that I'm standing in because they don't have anyone else yet. (they didn't realise I was a gal but my playing is good so I'm ""allowed"" to come along)   ..hrumphDoes it mean that this meeting will further my goals and we will all get along? Or is there another layer to this and greater things are afoot elsewhere for me?Many thanks for your consideration. I am stuck "
2777,"Hello everyone again,I have been reading the threads about 44, but none of them seems to be enough for me cause i still dont understand. What is 44 really talking about, what is it really trying to tell, when i get 44 i dont even bother reading the answer for my question cause i am clueless  so some MORE insight would be good, i feel dumb D."
2778,"Oh boy, so I guess this is where I spill my guts...The story begins with me contacting a man who I felt immediately drawn to. I rarely do this online, mostly just using the web to keep in contact with friends I know personally but something just compelled me!This was right around the highly charged time of the Aquarius new moon solar eclipse of Jan 26th 2009. There was something that drew me to him and the chain of synchronicity that manifested during the time building to the Leo full moon lunar eclipse on Feb 9th, 2009 was just too intense. The only way I can describe it is meeting your anima/animus in a lucid dream. Our astrological signs were also in perfect harmony with complementary sun signs(Aries/Libra) and matching ascendants/descendants(both in Leo/Aquarius) as well as my moon being in the same sign&degree as his descendant, all signs pointing to a VERY compatible match(I know the info because it was posted on his profile and me being an astrology junky I picked it up right away).We had SOOO much in common, a soul link really which is rare for me because I am so eccentric. Then when he told me of his screenplay that dealt with synchronicity, Carl Jung archetypes and a man who met his soul mate that manifested only in his dreams, I felt he was speaking to me because it was something I had been musing over for a while. I guess I've been waiting for him.. So to move things along, he felt the same about me, joking that we should get married, he even had the same last name as the one I adopted and have been planning to legally change to, convenient eh? The buildup culminated finally on the full moon lunar eclipse when he made the first move and asked to meet me. But as the saying goes, life is not always a smooth ride and obstacles stood in the way of this..for me that is. The thing is I've just recently emerged from an exhaustive creative depression and was NOT ready to meet him. I had too many lose ends that needed to be tied up, was on financially shaky ground after being laid off and could not take the plunge just yet..sooo what I did is I told him I was away and would love to meet as soon as I came back. I did not name a particular date so it was very vague and open ended.Ok, so less than two weeks pass by and he disappears! He deleted his account without a word after posting a public update about moving to another state. During this time I also had an unfamiliar male voice whisper my name into my ear at night, quite strange..The only explanation I could come up with is that he thought I had rejected him by not getting back to him in regards to setting a time? That I kind of stood him up in a way? I do know that I can appear aloof and intimidating to men but this seemed rather rash..I cast the I Ching after that asking what was up and got hex 61 changing to hex 6. One of the changing lines was 4 which states:""Six in the fourth place means:The moon nearly at the full.The team horse goes astray.No blame.To intensify the power of inner truth, a man must always turn to his superior, from whom he can receive enlightenment as the moon receives light from the sun. However, this requires a certain humility, like that of the moon when it is not yet quite full. At the moment when the moon becomes full and stands directly opposite the sun, it begins to wane. Just as on the one hand we must be humble and reverent when face to face with the source of enlightenment, so likewise must we on the other renounce factionalism among men. Only by pursuing one’s course like a horse that goes straight ahead without looking sideways at its mate, can one retain the inner freedom that helps one onward.""Woah, this seemed right on. So I asked the burning question; is he my soul mate? I got hex 11 changing to 55! Two of my favorite hexagrams which always invoke beautiful imagery in my mind.I firmly believe in destiny and the idea that if you love something, let it go and if it comes back, it's meant to be so I felt at peace releasing him but not until I sent him a message at his other account asking why he ran away. He still has not read or replied.. I am trying to remain detached and wait it out when we are both ready or rather when I am ready. It's almost as if he unconsciously is giving me time to work through my issues right now..I am making swift progress, beginning to emerge from my dark cocoon and regaining balance in my life. I've returned to my daily mediation/yoga practice, have been feeling very positive and am finally inspired to create art again!But in spite of all these beautiful changes fueling my recovery, there is a dark empty corner of melancholy stemming from the concern that I might have let him go..because connections like this are rare. So once again I asked the I Ching about us, if we are meant to be together eventually and got hexagram 29 unchanging...If someone can please help me understand what this all means and offer some wise advice, I would be ever grateful.Thank you!Love & Light,Sibyl"
2779,"Hey all i am new to forum. I have been interested in I ching for quite some time. I have done my own readings, but i have never talked to anyone about i ching. i bring this up because i don't understand when you post 43.1.2.3, i am assuming the .1.2.3 are change lines?okay, now to my question. I am in a long distance relationship, and i noticed things were  not going as smooth as normal, so decided to consult with  i ching about this. The day before i  consulted i ching, i wrote her a letter, but had not mailed it out yet. So anyways the following day i decided to do a reading. I can't tell you the exact question, because when i do it i do not ask in words...its more of a thought pattern to me. but i guess if i were to put it into words it would be like ""what is happening,  and what should be done?""So i throw myself a 2 (change lines top 2 and bottom 2...so if my assumption is right it would be 2.1.2.5.6?) I interpreted this as be calm (the book said docile), and things will work out fine. So i reread my letter to her and thought ""this letter is quite calm,  nothing demanding in it at all. i decide i will send it out the next day, when i have money, and time to do so. anyways it did not take the next day to get money and time...something unexpected happened to where i got money and time....so i sent it that day (yesterday).When i get home i decide to look up the definition of docile and i got:willing to be taught or led or supervised or directed;ready and willing to be taughteasily handled or managedI kinda freaked out about this..thinking, sending a letter  is not being docile...did i screw up? And i started thinking about what was in  the letter. Really it was a letter asking for guidance from her.  That made me feel better, but still a very small part of me asks myself was sending the letter the wrong thing according to my reading. "

2781,"hello everyone,if anyone can give me some insight into a career question, I'd be very grateful. I'm not longer happy in my full-time job: for one, it doesn't sit with me ethically, as it's in an industry I don't feel aligns with my values. Two, I'm undervalued and overworked at this job, and despite having a great boss, she has no decision making powers and her higher ups refuse to promote me, despite the fact that I actually have a great deal of responsibility. I really feel it's time to leave. Here are the readings I drew:--Is it time to leave this job? >> 21 (Cutting Through) to 33 (Retreat). I took this as a strong 'yes'.--If I attempt to go freelance, will I be able to make it work? (I'm concerned because of the economic crisis). >> Drew 53 unchanging, then 8 (Holding Together), changing line 5, to hexagram 2 (The Receptive). --If I instead attempt to find another full-time job, am I likely to find something worth leaving my current job for, that will really be aligned with what I want to do? >> drew 16 unchanging (Enthusiasm).I really don't know how to interpret these results. My heart keeps telling me to give freelance a go as I already have a gig that pays well and gives me a lot of creative freedom, and I could make a lot more of it. But I'm afraid of doing this with all the economic turmoil...I've gotten used to a certain level of financial security...Many thanks for any insight."
2782,"Hello,I need your opinion about this answer I got.The question was:Please describe the image that X has of me. (Hmmm, this is a strange English... You know, It's about the ""picture of me"" in his mind.)42.1.5 > 23X is a friend, a man that I met a few weeks ago. We are friends. We met in ""tête-à-tête"" just once, at dinner. sort of a date, I guess. I like him, or I should say I'm in love with him. I think the answer says something like ""that's ok, he thinks you're ok, maybe he thinks you're an ""opportunity"" (42.1), but stop asking (42.5)"". I don't know if 23 has to do with us being somehow separated - we don't see each other very often, and practically/""officially"" there is nothing romantic between us. (I don't know if I should add ""yet""...) Something like ""if there really is something between you, there will be changes/progress; just wait and see"". Thanks for your help.s."

2784,"Hello,I drew this hexagram for a relationship that has been challenging since I first met the man three years ago. Our feelings for each other, our mutual love, is strong. There are difficulties on both sides - however he is the one who presents the greatest challenge, as twice already he has gone through a cycle of coming together with me, being harassed by his ex (who harasses me too), this ends up by parting us, he renews with his ex, only to fall into a depression, which leads him to part from her again, and so on. The latest cave-in came before Christmas, when to please his grown-up children he agreed to take back their mother - only to admit to me a couple of weeks ago that he is exhausted, depressed and doesn't care much about anything (if you are surprised by this language, that is how she puts it herself: she refuses to let him go, he agrees to ""take her back"", then plunges into depression). He also admitted that he had trouble giving us a chance, because he doesn't believe he can be happy or fulfilled in a relationship anymore, the unhappy years spent with the mother of his children have robbed him that possibility. This kind of cycle is disempowering for me. I don't want to enable him, and it's obvious he's caught up in some kind of addictive and/or abused behaviour, which makes him miserable, but seems to grip him periodically. As a result, I moved to another country and made alternative plans for myself, but I still care for him. I have also come to realise that knowing him, and being with him, has made me grow and develop as a human being and a woman more in 3 years than in much of the 39 years before I knew him - spiritually, mentally, emotionally and erotically. A part of me wonders if there is still a chance for us after all, if this is a process we are going through - and he in particular - in order for us to get together, and that together, we can heal and find fulfilment through facing and defeating challenges. A part of me is discouraged and thinks it's pointless, that despite what we bring to each other, he is too caught up in his vicious cycle and unable to grow out of it. So I turned to the I-Ching, as ever, and asked how things would develop *between us* in the foreseeable future, given the situation at hand. I drew 42, Increase, with changing lines 2, 4 and 5. These are all very encouraging. Line 2 seems to suggest that perseverance will pay off and is well-supported; line 4 that by my keeping to a moderate path and moving the ""lord"" will follow; and line 5 that being sincere and kindhearted will lead to success.  But the hexagram changes to 64, Not Yet Completed - which might suggest yet another incomplete cycle. Or maybe it tells me that the increase will bring us to a crunch point, and that is when we can make or break our relationship: but much will depend on the wisdom of my own behaviour. I would like to know what you make of such a draw. I am not asking for a comment on my relationship as such, but rather, on what  hexagram 42, 2.4.5 >>64 might mean for it.Many thanks :bows:"
2785,"I'm a bit befuddled today over this reading I got. The question I asked was ""am I ready for marriage?"" I asked it because it has been something I wanted for a time now but my friends have joked that I am not ""marriage material"" probably because of my somewhat wild past...anyways...the answer was 46.1.2 and as i read the lines it sounded like a definate yes to me and that this is definately the path for me now (as i felt inside).What interests/confuses me is that this changed to 36, darkening of the light in the past I always read the resulting hex as a result of the advice or situation depicted in the lines but this one just doesn't seem to make sense to me.I have received 36 before when I was in bad state emotionally but I have not been like that for a long time. I'm wondering if anyone can offer some insight about how to fit 36 into this reading?"

I asked the i ching to help me clarify what to do at this point, and received 1-63 (changing lines 2,4,6)My i ching says to be calm, centered, and I know that 1 is good- however, 63 feels a little negative. Do anyone have a suggestion on how to interpret this?thanks."

2788,"Hi everyone,I’m a bit stuck with a reading regarding a health issue. Long story sort, a fatigue problem lately has reappeared with all the frustrating consequences.I asked Yi “what needs to be done” and I got 27.1 > 23. The relating hexagram (23) , might say that I have been a bit superficial because lately have spend energy without thinking a lot and that maybe I haven’t realized the reality of that situation. Reduce, cut some of the thing, ( which are not that much),  I do now and are energy consuming.Line’s 27. 1 message is not clear to me. Any help would be appreciated Thanks,Maria"
2789,"A good friend directed me to this site, explaining that it might help me try to understand what I might be doing, without relizing it. Exploreing within.. you might say.Am not sure really how to start.   I need to understand what I may be doing wrong, in dealing with Men .A little background about me.Most of my life.. has been within a marriage or long term relationships.  Now, in my later years am cast into the unknown, I find myself struggling on how to relate to men. Which in itself a surpise to me, I have never had this problem before. I have this huge fear of being hurt, and am afraid that I might my signals to men may say... go away. At first I never thought about it... but now am begining to wonder. My friend says that I need to allow myself to take chances. I was not aware that I was not. I started dating about a year ago, after giving myself time to get over a huge hurt.Dating a few men, having fun, but nothing serious. I did meet one guy that has keeped my interest, we have been dating very casual for about 8 months, seeing each other only about once or twice a month, usually in just involves hanging out at his house , making dinner and watching movies or something. Just nice ya know.  At first he seemed into the whole thing, talking about seeing more of each other and stuff, I sort of took his words like a grain of salt, never comenting on them, because he never called more or saw me more. and I never asked him about it, just let him be free you might say.Right now we are friends, I do not demand time from him, I just let him be . We just seem to get together when the urge sets in.  Remind you we both date others, he is not on my mind everyday.. its just that there is this feeling about him that I have.. comfort ? We have never had heart to talks, or talked about us. We just are what we are. Lately I have been wishing that maybe I would want more . My friend thinks am putting out the wrong signals to him.  So at there suggestion I askedWhat kind of signals am I putting out to him    45. 3,4,6 going to 53.Then on a general question about all men.. I askedHow do men view me   41 1,2,3 going to 52I have had a few guys tell me, that they cannot read me, If you could also suggest a general question to get me on the road to understand how I relate to people ( not just this guy) it would be helpful.Thank you for you time.Last edited: Mar 9, 2009"
2790,"Hello,I have asked a couple of big questions recently but feel that I've only touched the surface with them and I'm not sure how capable I feel at the mo to properly tackle the ideas with my full attention! (which has been a bit scattered of late)Anyways here they are.  Would be interesting to hear thoughts and/ or experiences on the subject!  And also alternative interpretations as always 1.  Who or what gave us the polarities of Yin and Yang? (i.e the World as we know it)Hex 34 unchangingVery apt - the lower creative and upper arousing.  Heaven and thunder coming together. (Big Bang?)  Perhaps Yin Yang came into play to tame this powerful force and bring balance.2.  Who are you?Hex 2 UnchangingSo the receptive   Receptive to our questions (and v patient lol!).  I also read that hex 2 translates to a Guide 3.  Am I the creative then?  (as in, am I subconsciously choosing the hexagrams)20.1,2,4 > 60I think saying I only have a narrow viewpoint at the moment, and perhaps that there is a limit on how much I am in control of the answers (suggesting there is a higher force?)  Stressing a need for less subjectivity also suggests another presence? 20.4 also features in this thread asking the same Q :http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=7381And Trojan said: i see it as saying as a 'guest' ie not one of us enacting the human drama, it, the Yi, can give us the benefit of its vision and view. Very modest answer IMO....then again we may be the guests in the Yis kingdom, getting a different view for a while...then again...Again suggesting that the Yi is external and overseeing us.Trojan: Maybe your 'deeper self' and 'deeper force in the universe' are the same thing. That again resonates nicely.  And the Yi is all about attuning yourself to your inner nature, and how it can be at one with the forces of the Universe, to bring you peace.  So perhaps it's about reaquainting ourselves with our hidden abilities... which we can access through hidden dimensions in the Universe perhaps when we consult the Yi?(Been reading a bit of 'The elegant Universe' (string theory)  But I'll stop there as I am just throwing out concepts now!4.  Are you bigger than me?57.3,5 > 4To me a clear yes.  I am the young inexperienced student (fool sometimes )  Who is being influenced by the Yi.  I liked that it was gentle influence.Finally,  I have an aunt whom I would describe as pretty close to perfect (she's very lovely, the cleverest person I know, modest and controlled but still fun!)  However she can also be quite closed minded (she has a very rational, practical, fact based mind) and when I told her of my enthusiasm for the Yi she maintained any hexagram, line, could be looked at as relevant to my question and that the answers were inside me already (which oft times they really aren't!) However, I did manage to rouse her intrigue when I spoke of the specific relevance of certain lines to my questions.  I also reminded her that there are 64 diff hex's with 6 lines each - so that's quite a big pool of probablity - and for my answers to never fail me, when I know they could, is saying something!  But I dropped the issue (although said I would compile evidence to make a proper argument and I have also yet to show her the text which might make her appreciate it rather than be so dismissive.)But I am not going to push too far with her, because she is very self assured and not one to ask for advice anyway, so I suppose the idea of the Yi is against her nature.I asked about her and received 11 unchanging.Peace.  Perhaps saying that she is at peace and does not need the Yi and so not to impress it on her?  She has been through her fair share of hardship and is a great role model of strength - perhaps it's saying she has found perfect balance with herself?Any comments here would be really interesting!!:bows:Last edited: Mar 8, 2009"

2792,"Hello all,  OK, a while back I went on a blind date, some of you would remember that one. Well, things of come quite well, except... on little tiny bitty thing...lol  We have not progressed to the physical level. Now am over to his house today, were watching a movie, having a little wine, getting playful. Am thinking... Whooo hoooo am going to spend the night here..  After the movie, he gets up and proceeds to clean the kitchen ???? I help. But I had a sense that he wanted me to leave... so I did. He did not try and stop me. This man is mixed signals all the way..lolMy question was Why did he send me home. 3.5Then I asked How do I approach X.I got 29.6Here is my take... now he really did not send me home, I just felt it.  I did some reading on 3.5.  I see a little fear ? Not really think that's it. He seems pretty confindeint in himself, but never really forward with me. Just puts out little comments , like he wants to see my reacation, ( which have been positive). Maybe he is just not attracted to me. .. Geez I don't know.Now... 29.6 that one is telling me DO NOT GEY EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH THIS GUY !!!! lol... guess the I ching does'nt like him? OK  ... for fun.. I askedI asked how does x feel about me... got 49  1346 .. going to 20.I have no clue...I really was not concern with that one... but would be curious what you all came up with."
2793,"I asked the oracle: ""What is the way forward,"" mostly in reference to a person who I've recently hurt in several ways, but I haven't MEANT to hurt her. We used to be romantically involved, and she's kept calling me over and reminding me that there's still a level of emotional attachment on her part. I'm trying to break it, and I know it's hurting her but in the long run it's probably better for both of us. She's coming home with me for spring break, and we're going to the desert for 5 days. I'm not quite sure if the Oracle is referring to that trip on line 5, and I fear whatever Hex 18 is trying to tell me. Personally, i've been going through a lot of thoughtful change in my life. I'm trying to become less dependent on other people and working on becoming a better student and stronger person.Any thoughts from the community regarding what the Oracle has said about the situation?"

2796,"Hi everyone,My ex and I keep in touch, and he sent me a poem of sorts because I sent him some fiction writing of mine. His poem basically asks, how do long-term couples stay together? Is it a secret only they know? Or are they just afraid of being alone? The poem also asks, why do we screw up our relationships and why don't we make them work? After reading this, it makes me think he still has regrets and guilt over his divorce which happened about 13 years ago. He and I had an affair (a huge mistake), which I'm sure was the factor. At the end of his email he said he welcomed any comments from me. I want to give him my impressions on his writing; however, because I think it's about her, I feel awkward talking about it. Plus, I wonder if this will douse any possible get together between him and me.So my Q for the I Ching was, ""Is he still feeling guilt and regret over his ex?"" I got 32 > 34. A few days later I asked the same question, because I re-read the poem to give him my feedback. Again, I got 32, but no changing lines.I read posts about 32 on this site and gained some valuable insights, but for my Q I feel these results could mean different things, depending on who the I Ching is actually referencing (me or him). I'd like to see what you all think...Thanks so much for your time,Sue:bows:"

2798,"Hi Everyone,I've been throwing the I Ching on and off for many years now. Currently, I'm using LiSe's  lovely text as my primary source. For me the I Ching is like a wise friend who is more apt to provide insights that help me find the answer to my question than to simply give me the answer itself. I find LiSe's translation and commentary particularly well suited for this approach.I happened on Clarity some months back and have used it as a regular resource ever since. I've finally gotten up the courage to join and ask a question of my own. It involves a romantic relationship that began about a month ago. The man is a very talented artist and teacher of art, and it  was in the latter role that I first encountered him, a couple of years ago. Our contact has been sporadic for the past year until we finally got together last month.I asked whether I should approach him now regarding my own artistic work. He mentioned it during our first date, and, as usual, his comments were remarkably perceptive and helpful, but it hasn't come up since then and I've been hesitant to broach the subject. I threw 40.3.6 => 50. Overall, it seems like a very positive response, Release (of my artistic blocks) leading to a Cauldron where I can transform my experiences into something beautiful and nourishing to the spirit. Line 3 concerns me though. In asking the question I was thinking mostly about the guidance he could give me, but there is also the potential for more practical help, such as introducing me to the ""right people"" in the business. That would be a very 40.3 situation, and if that's all the I Ching is saying that's fine. (It's not something I'm looking for at this point anyway.) What worries me is that it may refer to the guidance aspect as well, that the relationship could grant me the interest and attention from this excellent teacher that my work did not inspire on its own. 40.6 isn't really clear to me either, but perhaps it is saying that if I keep my aim firmly on the bulls-eye (or the bird's eye as LiSe puts it), that is, on progressing to the point where I can create something of real value, that this will justify the humiliating, 40.3 aspect of the situation.  Does this seem like a reasonable interpretation, or am I just seeing what I want to see? Also, does the reading provide any additional insight into how I should approach this with him (assuming I should)? Any thoughts would be much appreciated."
2799,I think I am on the right track now55.2.5>43Now thats positive I feel I understand why the Yi doest give you yes and no answers because there is always more than meets the eye just that first reading i got was telling there are issues that are preventing me from having a future with anyone for that matter that I need to address to be happy with this girlHard to get the question right sometimes also sometimes when you yourself dont even know what the question really is. so then how do you understand the answernext time I think i will try to ask more questions realting directly to myself I have impatience issues obviously as well:bag:Steve
2800,"I asked the I ching if I have a future with this womanI recieved 40.3.4.5.6>57I was bit thrown back as how to read this I am not the best when there are so many lines anywayshould i be giving more weight to 57?Is this woman a gold digger?, because she certainly doest appear to me to be.Just with line 3 and 4 talking about inviting robbers being around the wrong peopleThe other it could be talking about is some of my friends always wanted me to go to the pub and spending my money in the wrong places also so they could be preventing me from taking the path to be with her as well so if that kept happening I wouldnt have a future obviouslyShould I ask another question more direct, like is she good for me maybe the question was 2 broad?I have no idea what this meansNeed a hand on this one,,,,pleaseSteve"
2801,"I asked if I was wasting my time with this girlI felt like the I ching was shouting its not her its you ya dummywhat do you think ,, or maybe start getting serious your on a good thingSteve"
2802,"I am a bit confused. My friend told me that he would like a lift to the airport but when I messaged him 2 days ago to ask him the details abt the time and place he never replied. But he continues to forward emails to me. I met this guy on a dating website, met him twice, still dont know what he feels towards me, so I have decided to just take it as friendship and when I do and message him in goodwill to find out details for dropping him off next week, he doesnt reply. I can do the girl thing and figure a 100 reasons why he doesnt want to reply to my message. But it's so silly!!! I just feel akward having to even think like that. I dont like offering a favour not knowing if I shud leave that day free cos it's my time. So I asked YiWhy hasnt he replied to my text msg?19 (5) -> 60What abt waiting for him to get back to me on my msg?52(5) ->53What abt contacting him abt the msg I sent?53 unchangingCan someone offer me their 2 cents kindly?

2803,There is a certain someone I am not sure of how to proceed with.  Its kind of on and off. The questions were as follows:Please show me the most proper and beneficial course of action to take with this person.  -  36.1.2.4.5 to 28.Please show me what attitude or action I should take now in order to bring about this 36 to 28.  -  41.2.4 to 21.Please help me understand why I need to move away from this person now.  -  53.1.5 to 22.Thank you.
2804,"Hi all,I asked the Yi recently whether I should admit a (minor) oversight to someone I am going to be working for, or whether it'd be best not to mention it and keep the message positive.I received 33.4,5,6 > 15I wasn't sure whether to read this as admit the mistake by showing modesty or retreat from showing modesty?  Because, if I was to read it as saying not mentioning the mistake would result in modesty then that doesn't make sense, but retreat from your intention in that moment to show modesty does make sense.So I read the hexagrams as forming a sentence, and didn't mention it.Do you agree that readings are meant to be read as sentences rather than a glimpse of where things are headed? (Unless you ask a question about the future)Would be interested to hear if any one else generally reads readings as sentences?  Kind of makes the answer simpler and less elusive and encourages you to be proactive in the moment rather than contemplative.. but I don't think the sentence theory could work for every reading :bows:"
2805,"Hello,I need your help with this answer I received this morning.I recently had an interviu for a job that seems to be very interesting, very rewarding, practically exactly the job I was looking for (at least this is how it seems to be). And I think the interview was ok, my feeling was that yes, I might be offered the job.It's a big company (6.000 employees), the job is very highly placed in their organigram. Searching on the internet, I discovered that they have been publishing the job offer an an (almost) regulary basis in the last 7-8 months. Which made me wonder: why is the job still ""on the market""?. The logical answers would be: the company is situated in an area where nobody wants to go every day (traffic, distance... at least 2,5-3 hours in car, every day), so there are not many candidates; or, the salary expectations of the candidates were too high; or... there is something tricky here, that I don't see yet.So, I asked:Why is this job still on the market?The answer: 41.2 > 27.  And I don't understand it.  . Could it be about the salary expectations of the candidates they had? Something about decreasing (41) the salary expectations (27)? Thanks.(PS: I think my salary expectations  were ok for them, I think it's within their budget for this position.)Last edited: Mar 5, 2009"

He is always in a hurry and his memory is becoming poor due to stress I feel and this is topping him applying for a promotion at work also.

2808,"Hi guys, just before I cast this reading tonight, what was on my mind was that I am actually running out of energy to fight off the obstacles and am afraid I may end up giving up my dream as I cannot carry on defending my position for much longer, everything seems such a struggle and I am not a match for the person I am up against.  I desperately need some guidance how to get through the difficulties, so that's what was on my mind when I asked: ""What should I do to get the best possible outcome?"".  The changing lines 1, 4 and 6 of hexagram 39 seem like such a hard work, definitely like the way I feel... obstacles almost impossible to overcome, unless great help is found (or am I misinterpreting it?).  What about the hexagram 13, Fellowship...? I keep getting this hexagram but I cannot think of anyone who could support me other than the lawyers whom I cannot really afford...Can anyone shine some light on this reading please?"

2810,"Hi guys,I need some help with interpreting.Currently I am in hex. 35.2, I have had that hexagram for the past year and a half now.I looked at several texts, and in general they all  say that with hex 35.2 you have to persevere then you will be blessed. This interpretation of line 2 really struck me at how accurate it was. It really hits the spot:Line 2Sorrowful in his progress. Righteous persistence brings good fortune. Blessings are bestowed by one's ancestress.The meaning of this line is quite similar to that of line 1, except that the teaching is on a higher level. The persons depicted here are sorrowful because their own progress does not seem to be what it ought to be, nor does that of others. They instantly recognize the great many things that need to be done, but their helpers are few. Most other people are uncaring. Persistence in what is right will eventually bring good fortune. This line is the correlate of line 5, a Yin line, so one is supported by one's ancestress (a female who has gone before).Hex 35.2 really sucks. And for the past year and a half I can't seem to get out of it, I mean, there are simply no options left for me to take, no way out of the situation. With this hexagram, I just feel lost.And for anyone here that does astrology, I am also in a major shitty period(transit Saturn conjunct Sun, transit Pluto opposition moon, transit Uranus opposition sun soon square ASC, transit Saturn square ASC, progressive mars square mercury). There really seems to be no way out.So I asked: Will I find a solution for this situation I am in? Hex 33.2>44.What I found was there are mixed interpretations of this line, positive and negativeThank you for your insights:bows:Last edited: Mar 2, 2009"

2812,"dear onlineclarity friends,I have to say, I am quite new to the I Ching and often read your threads in order to learn more. This time I have to submit a question myself.I have a degree in Languages and another in Economy coming soon. I recently got fired from my previous job as teacher (because the school was closed as a consequence of the crisis) and am not really willing to go back to teaching in the future. I asked the Yi what he thinks it's the best field where I could find happiness through my work and I got 31 unchanging. Do you think the it means: ""wherever you find happiness and influence"" as I do?  The case being I think it's a too ""clever"" answer Later,I asked if work in international relations would be a good idea: and I got 36.1.3 changing to 2. Good or bad?  I see some worry but maybe some positive outcome.I would be glad to have your feedback, thanks in advance :bows:"

2814,"Ok so when I was doing a reading one of the coins landed on an angle and when I moved the blanket it was on to straighten it out, it flipped over.  Should I read the original or the coin after it flipped over?  Or should I have just started over?The question was ""What direction should I take in my job situation now?"", the situation mainly being the position I am in currently.  I'm not happy and I'm not sure if I should stick with it for a bit or start looking right away.  The first reading was 61.1.3 to 57 and if I count the other side of the coin after it flipped over it would be 42.1.3 to 53. Either way, they are both confusing.So I guess this is a 2-part question.

Which is encouraging but such an immense task of organisation, especially when our 'leaders' are more concerned with other matters - seemingly those that satisfy instant graticication, or maintaining 'power'.Wilhelm:  '..here is enthusiastic looking up to a leader.  If a man hesitates too long, this will bring remorse.  The right moment for approach must be seized, only then witll he do the right thing..'Hmm, we really need to just do it ourselves, but how can we battle against what our government deems acceptable, and its slow progress when it comes to trying to reverse the damage and cut back?  Perhaps the credit crunch is just what we need?  Less manufacturing; less cars on the road; less spending more quietness and perhaps creativity in these times where capitalist pushing ahead has been stalled?  And perhaps a greater instigation to save on electricity etc, which can only be good for the planet?Go crunch!? Just a thought :bows:"
2817,"After allowing some time and space to pass, I could not help myself but to check in with the IC regarding my confounding situation with D.  I currently believe it is finally over and yet I understand that in many ways it will never be fully over...  Having mixed feelings about this, but it is what it is....and what will be will be...  I've been exercising lots of prayer and positive thinking over the past weeks, as well as much visualization (thank you Meng!!!) of cutting cords and firmly walking away.Yet, I can't shake the strong gut feeling that this is merely the quiet lull before yet another ultimate storm    and am struggling to feel any peace from the""peace"" I've enforced with my protective measures and boundaries.  Wanting some reassurance and to ""check in"", I asked IC:Please show me a picture of how D is doing (I still worry a great deal about him and his situation):Response:  13 changing to 27.  I didn't document the changing lines, but there were 3 of them. I believe it was 3, 4, and 5?  Or was it 4, 5, and 6?  This seemed a pretty good place for him to be, although I think there are struggles in there.  It seemed mostly good...Feeling a bit reassured (umm, safer?), I then asked what is D feeling about all of this with us  now...(i.e. after I've enforced this time and space?)Response:  13, line 5 changing to 30.  Hmmmmm...  this response seems positive in a way, but also painful as well.  30 always feels full of hope and promise to me, but line 5 definitely seems to indicate some sadness and strife still hanging out there...I feel somewhat better and also a bit unsettled about these responses (Oh WHY did I break down and ask about this even...kicking myself a little here).  Prayer is a wonderful help with this, but I still have the nagging feeling of desperately wanting to know what to brace myself for.  Preparation in this situation is vital and most likely the only defense strategy I have left to utilize....so ask, I doAs always, I'm eager and grateful to hear your wonderful and fully objective thoughts into these!!:bows:~Namaste~"
2818,"So I (somehow - I guess they synchromystical currents of reality) have stumbled upon Astrology and been looking into what it says about me. I find some of it revealing - and some of it defiantly off (perhaps i'm missing some details or they are). I'm interested in this however and have actually gone to an astrologer before who did a Horary analysis to see if I was ""Cursed"" - having been trying to mess around with understanding magic and blah at that time cuz my mind was restless board needed a new frontier. So I paid this guy some money and he came back with a reading that strongly suggested I was ""cursed"". He said it would get better with time. That was about 2 years ago. Black death night of the soul indeed. Purposeless suffering and confusion - leading nowhere and back. Anyhow...Never talked to the guy again just got on with my life. Seemed like a cool guy - sincere and ready to assist - but defiantly a businessman nonetheless. Anyhow I was reading a bit of this astrology stuff. Seems to calm allot of my inner conflicts - as it tells me that this is part of who I am. I like allot of what it says. Makes sense to me - of course I don't like the negative side of it. Furthermore allot of it I find dead wrong. Like I'm a virgo and supposed to be extremely modest and conservative - but i've never followed traditional crap even for a millisecond of my life - not because I think they are wrong - just because I don't. I just don't. But Virgo's are supposed to be like a super anal-retendent - conservative  - predictable. I seem to have definite traits that conflict with this generic image. I can't even predict what i'm going to do next! I just can't see this Bartleby the Scrivener personality in me! http://www.bartleby.com/129/Anyhow I thought I would look into astrology - found out there was more to it. There is a Sun sign and then there is a Moon sign. And then there is a Rising sign. And then there are all the planets. (Wonder if they count planet X or Niberu eheh)---AnyhowThe thing I fear is it telling me something like - Oh your relationships in life will all be bad. You'll end up a eccentric loner with no friends. (like i am now for example). Actually I did a sample without knowing my exact birth date and it did say something like that. I have had miserable luck - (Impossibly bad trash cunning evil almost plotted designed for misery luck) in relationships. ... I don't want to hear anything bad like that. ANYHOW - To make a long story a little shorter. I asked:Please comment on looking into this astrology stuff? 7 --- ---9 --- - -7 --- ---7 --- ---7 --- ---7 --- ---Hexagram 1 - 14Line 1: Go meet the great man. Sounds like a favorable idea. OK done. Next:What about going back to Christopher Warnok who did that hornary analysis before who said I was cursed? 7 --- ---9 --- - -7 --- ---8 - - - -6 - - ---9 --- - -Hexagram 25 - 64So i'm taking it that it means. 1) It's a good idea at a basic level2) Don't worry about the outcome of what is charted on this analysis - that way you can succeed in doing it. 5) Don't worry about being cursed? 64, Go ahead and cross the water. Any comments or assistance in this stuff? What do you all know about astrology?

2819,"I have a question for clarification- I asked the i ching a question today, and would like to know generally, when I get a response, am I the subject in the response or are they. Secondly, more importantly, I don't want to get in the way of the future, so, I always ask a question and preface it with: I don't want to get in the way of things, (meaning that I would like the best possible outcome, and don't want to infringe upon it some expectation of how it might turn out. )Altogether, maybe I'm being naive- ? How does anyone else ask/handle responses from the iching. As an example, today,I asked about a work/personal relationship. Right now it is up in the air. We said goodbye, there are personal feelings there, and and in this particular instance, I received 11-34.My question was, I keep thinking of this person/situation, what do you advise for me? I feel that the i ching suggests there is a possible future- I feel hopeful, and dont want to get in the way by expecting things, or set myself up confusion/letdown.Hope that is pretty clear. In general, my present confusion remains the same-Am I missing something? Can anyone help with this? Thanks."

But two weeks ago the guy told me that he didnt want compromise (i never talked about compromise) and that he didnt feel ""the same"". So... i was very down.

He only says he doesnt want compromise and doesnt feel the same... But he is open tu an ""open"" relationship. I think he is waiting i take a decision: go on with him in this way, or stop to see us.... I dont take a decision,,, I only want to see what happens in my emotions in this days..

2825,My bf and I got into a big fight today over money. Long story short is he keeps loaning money to someone at work and the guy never pays him back. The bf promised me he wouldn't loan anymore to him and then I find out he loaned him another $1000 making the total nearly $5000. So we got into it about him breaking his promise and lying to me and him being so foolish.I asked the yi for insight on our fight this morning.I got 4.2 to 23I am not sure who is the teacher and who is the student in this situation.I could take it as the bf is young and he needs to make his own mistakes in life and just because I am older doesn't mean I should be bossy.I could take it as I should be patient with him and not have said anything because he is inexperienced and he is an adult and can make his own way in life.

So perhaps, he isn't attracted enough to pursue it as it would be hard to take it any further?I was still wondering though, if 64 > 57 was saying there was more ground here to follow and so should make a gentle influence?  Or could it be saying not to strive for more as the episode is nearing completion?But if I left it, how could it grow?35.5 again!!  I like it when this happens :bows:So again reminding me not to worry and take gains and losses to heart.So from this would you be of the opinion that it is best to leave this nice feeling as it is, and leave it in the past so as not to be silly with it?

I don't know him well, I don't see him very often and although I can feel there is some attraction between us (maybe I had caught his interest because it's him who is looking for me ), a natural and spontaneous approach to one another seems difficult to find a way out.I asked several questions:what's the truth about my situation with him?27(1,6)-2 ;i've found interesting things in a previous thread about this couple of hexagrams, i'm quite persuaded about them.what's his purpose in behaving upon me as he does, what does he want to get?56 (6)- 62; it's not a peaceful line i thinkwhat are his intentions regarding me (in terms of future )?49 (2,4,5,6)- 26; 4 changing lines and in the end a related hexagram about restraint ...don't let me suppose anything too different from the actual state of thingswhat could he essentially offer to me ?53 (3,5,6)-2 ; have no comments  , i really don't know to read this answergive me an advice to help me about him (because i'm too confused)10 (4,6)-60i need your knowledge and experience in putting together all these answers..., to understand the underlaying reasons of this person (not very transparent at all in his intents )"
2829,"I have a friend who has become quite distant with me recently without any obvious reason that I can see.  Everything was fine but lately it seems all I get is excuses or I get ignored. I asked how I can connect with this person emotionally and got 37.2.5 to 26.I suppose my first question should've been ""why is this person acting this way towards me"". I guess I'm going about this backwards.  That will be my next question, treating the symptom instead of the cause. In the meantime, any thoughts on this reading?"
2830,"I have a complex situation. I have been living in two countries (my homeland for 3 mos each winter, where I will be for 1 more month) and a foreign company.I was laid off this week but have to fly back to the other country next month to get my things and move out completely. Because of tensions at home, I have been wary of passing this information to my hosts (who are my parents) soon for a number of self-protective and freedom-related reasons.I asked the Yi, what if i tell them tonight? It showed me 62.4.What if i tell them next Wednesday? 25.5 and 21.My friends say I cannot/should not keep this from my parents (I'm a grownup though!) and yet I know that spilling the beans is going to open an ongoing discussion about why it happened, how it happened, where will I stay, what will I do, where will my things go, when will i find a new job etc. (my parents dont ""process"" things quickly). If i wait a few weeks to tell them (share the news after I can finish some immediate projects) i will feel a bit safer.Am I correct that both readings essentially say ""wait""?"
2831,"I asked the i ching how to move past my present money issues quickly and easily and received 61 changing line 3 to 9 . I think I understand 61 (inner truth), but line 3 of hexagram 9 is confusing to me, as my i ching says to hold back- Can anyone offer any clarification?thanks"

2833,"Hex 51 Arousing. I did a reading for myself yesterday and even though it did not speak to my question about what path to take in my future career it did speak to the events of the day and it inspired this poem. I recevied two changing lines in the first and second place.  I hope you enjoy:Free in 'Shang Di'The thunder roar of a dragon shakes the earth between my toes. My bare feet on the black earth absorb the tremor through my bones,Swirling angst through my guts, creeping now through my trunk,I feel it slither down my limbs and out through my finger tips. For a moment there’s terror,in a flash of white danger.Then it flows out,Down though the hills And then out of sight.Still alive and my limbs are in place, Laugh out loud at my still filled cup.What can stir what’s felt the breathe of the terror that lives in depths. No thunder, no dragon, no flash of white light, no hail from the sky can shake her tonight. The path to her heart has been tread many times, It’s packed down sturdy for rest through the night.Dangers come and terrors glance,They move along, off the path. “Leave me free to revere ‘shang di’To shine its light of omnipresenceOn my human dark recesses.”High on hills, in the dusky light, I hold my latern high above, enough to seethat I might look ‘down’, but not for long, Time will pass,What I've lostWill come back to me."
2834,"I have thinking about these hexs I threw the other day and I seem to go back and forth in my mind about whether or not they indicate a good possibilty or say the situation is hopeless. The back story is that on a recent out of town trip I met someone whom I really fell for and think there is a lot of compatability and chemistry and attraction between us and I know he felt similarly too. The trouble is in the fact that there are some big obstacles that are  in the way of us pursuing each other the way i think we both want to. Neither of us addressed the obvious obstacles at the time though. Now that I am back home, I've decided to take a wait and see approach but I did consult the I Ching for some insight here.I asked what he is feeling about me and the situation?39.2.3.4 to 47on the surface it looks bad but I think the lines in 39 do make some mention of trying to get past the obstruction and making a change in one's life and going down a completely different path (me?)I also asked Will he pursue me?6.4 to 59this seems to be a very similar reading to the above and something I read about hex 59 did mention something about good idea to travel, and that would be required in this situation What I am afraid of is spinning these readings in my mind to look more positive than they may be. Either way, my mind is made up to let him make contact first and if he does I will base my next move on that contact.What do you think? Have I got it right, does there seem to be a desire on his part to get around the obstacles and have a try with me? Or is my romantic heart running away with all reason again? "
2835,"I'm preparing a very important exam and I've been studying and practicing and reading and re-reading for weeks now and I'm beginning to panic. I know that, objectivelly, I know the thing very well, but it always seems to me that I could do more, learn more, practice more, more, more...I really got depressed tonight and I've asked IC about the outcome and got 34>2.Is it possible that I am actually overdoing it? Is such thing possible?!"
2836,"I aksed ""What is in store for me this year?"", and I got 61>55Since all the lines are changing except the first one, shall I pay closer attention to 55.1 than to 61 as a whole?(So many changing lines do make sense since I am in the middle of huge upheaval and marveling many changes.) Thank you."
2837,This is not something i've gotten recently but is something I've been curious about. Gotten it from time to time. Just now trying to be helpful on another person's thread involving hexagram 2. It brought up a few questions in my mind of what it means. My question is - If your in a situation where things seem to be not going anywhere. The other person is not responding. Not being receptive but seeming to shut down. You ask about the situation with that person and you get Hexagram 2. What would you say that situation means? I've always taken it to mean - Things are as they seem. This lack of involvement is something you have to accept. ?
2838,"Hello all, I am curious about this response and hope you can help me to understand the answer. yesterday I had a meeting with some person in the building where my friend works. I thought that my friend was coming at one stage to join us but he never did, instead he sent someone else.Today I felt curious about the reasons he didn't show up and ashed to the I Ching why. The response was 39.2.5 moving to 46.What do you think about this?Thanks!"
2839,"21 seems to be my recurring IC theme of the moment.  To me, this represents my biting through all the surrounding obstacles in order to move forward.  In looking around here, I also see that 21 is related to legal (or possibly moral?) issues as well.  I am dealing with some minor legal issues and I'm perpetually refining myself morally.  So, these make a kind of sense to me as well.  Although I'm vastly uncertain as to my effectiveness in ""biting through"" any of my difficulties...  I'm giving it a great deal of effort...so I'm hoping for an ""A"" from the Universe for that at least  At the least, I recognize the need for this and wish I could progress more quickly, but that just doesn't seem to be in the greater plan of things  Time with patience is my only hope!  Arghhhhhhhh  By the way, does anyone have any spare patience to loan me just temporarily....I seem to have depleted my personal source. If so,  I promise to give it back ASAP!!That said, I would appreciate additional insight into (any of) the following three ""21"" IC responses!1.  What is the current environment of my relationship(s)?Response:  21.1 changing to 352.  How can I best bite through the issues which are blocking my progress?Response:  35.1. changing to 21 (Hmph! Am I correct in sensing the circular logic here?  )3.  What is the truth that will set me free from this situation?Response:  64.1.2. changing to 21Gratitude and thanks to all of you and.....(deep radio voice here)  ""Thank yooouuuuu 21!""~Namaste~"
2840,"Hello!I'm not exactly new to IC, been consulting IC for years. I'm much better at reading the lines now then like 3 years ago, but there is still so so so so so much to learn. But I'm very ashamed to say that when it comes to multiple lines, I'm still extremely hopeless and was wondering if any of you can help me with 2 castings I did?I have been to Clarity's Learning page where it did list down quite a few pointers to how exactly to interpret multiple lines, but.... I'm afraid I'm not too bright. Well, I'm actually back to my hometown for a couple of weeks, having been away for an entire year. Naturally, I would want to meet up with a very close friend of mine. Afterall, we haven't seen each other for an entire year and there's tons I wanna share with him. But, strangely, he seems to be having great difficulties meeting up. Even to the extent that I get a hint of reluctance. Which is strange, coz we've been friends for 10 over years, that's not like him. Even while overseas, we were very chatty via MSN.So the 1st reading I did:Why is he having such a hard time meeting up with me now?An:19.1.2.4.5 → 45(O great, 4 changing lines. )And after some thought, I was guessing he might be having difficulties at home coz in our 10 years of friendship, he has shared quite abit of unhappy stories with me. So I asked.What are the family dynamics within his house now?An:28.2.3.4.5.6 → 23(5 changing lines... )Heeelllllppppp!!!I'm so lost now. Coz, as old friends, I do want to be able to help if there is a problem. But... Seems like IC is trying to tell me what the problem is but I just ain't good enough at interpreting IC's advice yet.If someone can also share with me some personal experience in reading multiple changing lines, I would be very grateful as well.Arigato!Last edited: Feb 15, 2009"
2841,"I think I have what is called HPPD.Trying to find out what it is doing to me, and how to heal from it, so I casted some oracles hoping for some direction and understanding. FIrst question was:I would like to heal from this condition any advice?I got 60.2 changing to hexagram 3It sounds pretty ambiguous to me as I don't know if it's telling me how to fix my  behavior in order to remedy the issue or if it's addressing it in a more general way. Then I asked it another question as I have been told that I seem a little ""Off"". Please comment on this being why some have said - I seem a little ""off"" and my lack of friends?Hexagram 6.1.5 to hexagram 64Then I asked:Please comment on general in the light of this?32.3 - 40( I get this one often - is it not just advice to be more like buddha?

2842,"Hi everyone,I've been struggling with whether a potential mate and I have any business being together. He's actually an ex who's pursuing me. I'm interested in him, but I'm cautious. So I asked the I Ching, ""Should we even date each other?"" I got hexagram 54 Marrying Younger Sister changing to 24 Return. I also read some conflicting interpretations of 54 on two different sites, so if anyone can help me with, I really appreciate the help. Sue"
2843,"I'm working through letting someone go...or at least an idea of potential between us. This is someone who I fell in love with at a time when my long-term relationship was going through a more than rocky patch. Things are back on track with my partner, but this other woman continues to haunt me, all the more because after dropping the issue and establishing a somewhat awkward friendship, we had a candid conversation the other day in which we essentially admitted how strongly we feel about each other. She's with someone else as well, and even though there are days when part of me feels like running away with her, I know I couldn't and wouldn't do something like that, because I do love my partner deeply (although we have continued issues, I admit). I've been feeling grieved over this because she left town shortly after this conversation, and now I feel this surge of emotion all over again, and sadness that we'll never explore this relationship at a level I know we'd both like to (if parallel universes existed). I'm trying to let it go, once and for all. Asking how I can release this grief and move on, I drew 41, lines 5 and 6, to 60, Limitation. I do think Limitation addresses the very necessary boundaries that we've set up. Any insight would be most appreciated. Thank you...Last edited: Feb 15, 2009"

I like him a lot, I would like to have a relationship with him, or at least to try to. I asked:What does he want from me?The answer: 27.1.6 > 2Does it mean that:27.1: He is already involved, but he's looking at me with hungry mouth hanging open.?Or maybe he's doesn't appreciate what he has (that would be me) and he looks greedly to another (woman)'s magic tortoise?(Never asked if he's already involved with someone else, my feeling was that he wasn't.)27.6: He will finally cross the great river, i.e. make that move that I am waiting for / getting involved with me? I.e. nourishing me and nourishing himself at the same time.Or maybe it's about putting an end to this... to what is happenning now between us? 2.0 seems to be auspicious, an outcome rewarding a mare's constancy/persistence.

Given my current ""mind-place"", that would also make sense...hmmm....This was the response to a question I've asked the IC about a person I know who has recently expressed an interest in dating me.

2851,"Hi,I had this reading last week, and am still struggling to understand. Without going into too much detail, I asked about a behavior pattern that has caused me much pain. My question was ""why do I do this?""I've worked on this issue a lot over the years, and have some sense of the causes and solutions (though sometimes there's a big difference between understanding things on a conscious level vs the emotional level). So I feel like 2 >11 doesn't make sense though it may hit something deep that I've yet to understand. The receptive/following part does seem to fit, but I can't work out the relationship with 11. This feels like one of those big readings that will work itself out over the course of years. Found some great stuff from Hilary,Hexagram 11 is a hexagram of intense dynamism: despite Wilhelm's translation of its name, Tai, as 'Peace', I've never found it to be remotely peaceful in practice... This aspect of the experience comes out clearly in its hidden core - the nuclear hexagram, 54, the Marrying Maiden. She is 'swept off her feet', hoisted without ceremony out of her comfort zone and up into a realm of far greater possibilities, but one altogether beyond her control. So is this loss of control a hidden danger of Hexagram 11? Perhaps. Or perhaps it's something you have to experience to know 'Flow' from the inside...With hexagram 11, the power of qian is no longer 'out there' to be followed; it's taken back inside, and made real through the outer trigram, Earth. Now there is a complete creative relationship between inspiration and realisation - and all things become possible:Click to expand...If anyone has additional insight, I'd be so grateful.Peace :bows:mary"
2852,"hi everyone,sometime ago as I explained in a previous thread I met an ex girlfriend and we have been in touch for some weeks right. I asked the Iching: what does she think about having a new relationship with me? and i got this hx.I supose that for understanding this I should give an explanation of our previous relationship. It finished 3 years ago, after 4.5 years together. The end was a real battle. And I think I was extremely rude to her, because I didn't understand some of her behaviours. We did not talk in these 3 years.Now after all these years I'm quite more calm and I don't react to the same things the same way. So I supose line 4 refers to this. Line 6 I think is the way she is testing me. She wants things to grow little by little and wants me to be conscious that if i try to force anything would lead me to ruin, and it is better to be calm a relax while she thinks this all over.If so, all is in the air. But she simply can think: he has changed, but if he wants a new relationship with me he would become entangle in something impossible.Can someone tell me if my reading is ok?Thanks to all of you"
2853,"my work just had a layoff about 3 weeks ago. my job remained in tact, but with the repurcussion of me being only 1/2 of the remaining development team. in theory, this would imply that i am essential to the team, and CANNOT be laid off at this point.however, my workplace is known to freely demote and fire people without notice.my current situation in a nutshell is my daughter got really sick this week, which means that i had to miss today and tomorrow, which wouldn't be so terrible, except that my boss had to take up my slack today and cover me for a really important deadline. she already needs to be off work to attend a funeral of a very dear loved one, but couldn't, half because of me, and half because of other work she needed to get done. she is VERY upset with me.i'm basically worried they are going to fire me.my first question--what will be the repurcussions for me due to this current issue at work?38 unchanging.this is generally pretty clear, and i think it is a present tense thing, like i am sufferring the repercussion right now this minute, with the opposition being between myself and my supervisor.​my second question--how will this current situation resolve at work?43-->31it seems like this is an ok response; but i'm worried that maybe it could be read that i will be removed from the situation (43) in order that another more appropriate person fill the position.​thoughts? i am so unbelievably anxious about this, any responses will be taken to heart.thanks."
2854,"Please help someone  I haven't been able to get a response on this and it's something weighing heavily because there's an action I should or shouldn't take....I asked the IC a similar question in 3 different ways and am now very confused.1. What will L think if I remove the poem from my blogsite? I got 2.4.6 > 352. So should I remove the poem if I want things to move forward in a more positive way with L? I got 35 unchanged3. Will L feel more comfortable to approach me if I remove the poem? I got 57.6 > 4835 indicates progress but the last reading doesn't seem positive.The poem was a way to communicate with L after a disastrous meet over 3 years ago and then failed attempts to communicate with him since then. It's both tender and flattering towards him, and also questioning and implicating, so it wouldn't have been an easy read for him. Plus there's no real natural way for us to communicate again unless he picks up the phone or writes and email, or organises something through a group situation i.e. a mutual acquaintance (which isn't a friend but I can't be sure they're an enemy either). Which could seem very unnatural after all this time, even by my standards.Please help! I want to do the right thing for the situation and for me. I've been worried that the poem is too honest and also that things have now since moved on in my mind, and alot of the petty things I mentioned aren't really important anymore (even though I don't want to compromise myself in the wrong direction). But my concern if I remove the poem, is that I'm giving him another message i.e. that I've closed the door on this story and am moving on. Then again, that may be a good message for him to receive. I just don't want to do it out of manipulation i.e. to get a response from him, nor for him to see it that way.thanks if anyone can shed some light  your insights are so helpful and very much appreciated"
2855,I'am about to start a secondhand shop.

2856,"Hello to all. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to provide some insight on drawing 10, Treading, no changing lines, when asking whether feelings and impulses should be acted on or restrained. I find this hexagram paradoxical because it seems to suggest caution and polite behavior, eg staying within the lines of decorum rather than letting the passions guide, but it's also about risking stepping on that tiger's tail. Not sure how to interpret this.Thanks!"

2860,"I need help with this.My mother and I have in general a good relationship throughout time, but there is always a point at which we stall and can't understand each other. Sometimes I don't have patience with her slowness and negligence towards life and react strongly (she says unpolitely but I do not agree). OTOH she always seems to adopt the victim role what causes a guilty feeling. I wonder if I am the wrong party, if she is the wrong party, if this would be the famous catholic guilt, how could I do to improve our relationship and who she really feels about me.I asked: ""What do I need to know about my strong reactions?""Answer:  5.3 >> 60  (this is not so confusing, seems to tell me to be patient)Then: ""How does she feel about me?""Answer: 49.3 >> 17  Confused I asked again, this time specifically about her love for me.Answer: 40.1.2 >> 51 Thanks in advance.

2861,"Hi again the other day I was stopped on the street as I walked out of a store, by a guy who was a seeming fortune teller. He immediately told me some things about myself (which were uncannily true!) and then proceeded to guess a number and colour of my choice to prove he had some clairvoyancy powers (which he evidently did).He then told me that I would receive good news about love/job or even money on 22 March 2009 and that 2009 was going to be a great year for me. And then we parted ways....I asked the I Ching if the news I'm supposed to receive on that day, will be related to a particular guy and set of people from my past, who have recently come up again in various ways. There's been some water under the bridge i.e. some damage, but it was such a brief relationship plus I didn't even meet all of the other people in the flesh, only over the phone. And with the ones I met it was only so briefly. But for some reason after 3 years this story keeps hanging around in my mind and my dreams and through weird connections. I got 25.4 leading to 42 so I took this as meaning if I stay true to who I am the universe will provide whatever it is that's meant for me - and that this may or may not be about that group or that guy. Which seems very open i.e. that what will be will be.....which kind of doesn't answer my specific question about whether these people are involved. Or is it about the universe providing that for me IF that is what I truly want???I should be honest too and say that I've wanted this connection for so long now, and I had a chance over 2 years ago to meet and work with one of the girls but everything went belly under because she got offended by some feedback I gave her. And regardless I really deep down didn't think her project was worthy enough for my passion and energy and standards so ultimately I bowed out before we got the chance to even meet in person and take it further. But I did come back with two offers to help out and even for us to work together on something else, so I was being very willing and friendly.....So I'm a little torn. I do really want this connection (because of the guy initially) but also because I'd like to join with like minds and I believe these people are on my creative and social/moral level. But the ball is really in their court now because I made the last few offers and they were coldly ignored.....obviously they were still not over what I said. I really don't feel that I should or would want to make another move, or that this is what they would see as right. In any case I published a poem on my blog site two weeks ago which really unravelled my side of the whole story these past 3 years, and how I felt about their actions and the whole confusion of everything, and how I still have some hope of reconnecting, so they have a real tangible prompt now to contact me again.....Any insight would be greatly appreciatedthanks "

2863,"Hello,As some of you may know I had difficulties fitting into my new house and the group.  Not that they are bad people, just that I'm quite different from them and don't perform so well in a group which they probs get frustrated by.  Anyway, things are ok at the mo but they are getting a house together when the tenancy runs out in a couple of months, but I said I would return home.  It wouldn't be right to live with them again as I don't have strong connections with any of them, though I do have a friend in this city and like it here.. and always said I wouldn't return home to my small town... but then I know I'll have family support there and can weigh my options without feeling social pressure re my next move in life.. but then I'm worried this'll be depressing; as I'll lack contact with people my own age and city opportunities etc.. but I think that'd be better than feigning feeling comfortable for the sake of appearing to be fitting in and succeeding..I asked What's the best advice you can give me about my current environment?44.4 > 57 Oh dear - bit of a criticism that I have been antisocial hence there are no fish in my tank, hence my house here is not a home (which is true) but I don't think it's all my fault - just incompatibility.. and I tried as much as I could though maybe my initial negitive expectations came into play too Is it right for me to return home?45 UnchangingPositive - but wasn't sure whether it was saying I should try harder with my peers.. but then maybe the gathering relates to my family and security back home? Or gathering myself together inside with freedom from outside social pressures?So I asked, Gather myself together at home or try harder here?45.3,4,6 > 53Wow with 45 again really comforting and feels as if the Yi is really in dialogue with me I don't think there is anything left for me here with these people.Perhaps the Yi is saying I should indeed gather with my family back home, and it will be a gradual process to make friends I'm comfortable with?  And require self knowledge and inner strength and acceptance first, so that people of like mind will gravitate to me and vice versa?  Or I suppose perhaps saying generally, that feeling a part of a group or community takes time and effort.What would you say?I think the encouragement is to return home, but I am a bit worried about this because I always thought it would be like regressing after uni, and though I will have family, I only have one friend close my age nearby, so I guess I'm worried about feeling detached from my generation... but maybe it's what I need now?Thanks for any input here :bows:"
2864,"All that discussion about collapsing waves and what meng said But of course it isn't Yi, per se, but the whateveritis which operates through Yi. Click to expand... Remindied me of  the question I always wanted to ask Yi. And I askedMe :Yi, How you do that ? Yi : 20.4 >12 Curious what you read in that answerMaria "
2865,"Hi guys,I've been doing some soulsearching lately, and because I'm in a tough period right now I've asked this question:What do I need to do in order for me to get to my path? 7.2>2any insights?ty:bows:"
2866,"Hello friends,     I am in a bit of a problem at the moment. I asked the Yi what happens if I go back abroad?  I want to know how will it be financially for me and my partner if we move abroad and I received 42.1.5 --> 23    Just to give you a little background. Me and my partner resigned from high paying jobs abroad to return to our home country but ever since we have returned home our life has been full of problems. I have found a job but no satisfaction and my partner still hasen't found one even after 5months. We are getting increasingly frustrated in these times of recession. I know that we will be highly paid abroad since we have already worked there...but we will still have to look for jobs there...so there is a lot of uncertainty as to how things will turn out. I would be really grateful if somebody could help me with this reading.Many thanksJane"
2867,"Hello, new member here. My question may have been covered elsewhere, but i couldn't find anything via Search, so here goes... Regarding Hexagram 48, if one receives it as an unchanging hexagram with no moving lines, or if it is the hexagram that appears following changing line(s), how do people interpret it? I ask this, because it seems to me that the judgement is somewhat ambiguous - unlike the Judgements for other hexagrams. Is it to be interpreted as presaging ill fortune, in the sense of something having run dry or run its course?Here is the Wilhelm translation:THE WELL. The town may be changed,But the well cannot be changed.It neither decreases nor increases.They come and go and draw from the well.If one gets down almost to the waterAnd the rope does not go all the way,Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.It seems to me that the last three lines are very different from the others. Is it a hexagram of good or ill fortune? What do people think? Thanks."
2868,"Hello all, I have a blind date on this Sat.   I have never been on a blind date before, and really nervous about it.  You would think that a woman in here 40's would have enough strengh about all of it.  I've been poking around here and trying to learn more about the I ching.The readings that you have all given me in a relationship problem, was right on.Now am moving on with my life.I asked will I be attracted to this date.. ( I know , pretty superficial of me ) I got 13.3   going to 25It speaks of misstrust, missunderstandings, and someone plotting schemes ?? I think am taking this is that .. I won't be attracted to him..hahahOr possible that the I ching is telling me that I have already gotten in my mind that this person should be mistrusted.. and I should not be trying to spy on them for asking such a stupid question ?Any insight would be helpfull, and I will report back on how my date turned out."

2870,"Hi to everybody,I am new at this site but have been seeing it for a while and i like it a lot.I work in a big oil company, but it is influenced by political aspects in every aspect.that I don´t like. I aske the i ching oracle if I should continue beeing sumisive with this job and I received 44 to 33, that is, in a doubt situation, better retire or quit...any comments..will be appreciated as i feel concerned for the outcome that might happen to me if I continue working here...carlos"
2871,"HelloIn the past two days I have had this reading twice, regarding two different people.  I aksed what was between us, as I feel an unspoken connection to these people and find them interesting, and kind of have feelings for them too.. but there is also something missing, something that makes for uncomfortable communication sometimes, and some sort of barrier against intimacy... perhaps it's just because of difference?What is 14.3 saying or advising about these people?Is it saying there is something good that just isn't being shared for some reason?And 38.3 saying there are misunderstandings but ultimately they don't really matter?Any input of experience with this line or clearer more useful interpretations than the one I can manage would be much appreciated!:bows:"
2872,I had a strange experience recently which i cannot understand because I am involved.  I met a young woman who is to study music.  She added me to her friends on facebook and I sent her an article I had written on music.  I was promoting a classical music festival and the article was Conservative as she is and she knows of the festival.  Within an hour she had taken me off her friends list.I asked the I Ching and got Hex.14. which is good in some ways but I cannot apply to this situation.  Could anyone clarify this for me?
2873,"Someone has recently gotten in contact with me after a long silence and I'm not sure how to respond so I asked the I Ching ""What is the proper course of action to take in response to this person's message?"" The answer was 3.1.5 to 2.Line 1 of hexagram 3 talks about finding help so I asked ""Who/what will be a helper to me in my situation with this person?"" I got 5.5 to 11.I'm thinking there's more to it than getting drunk but I'm having trouble getting past the food references in this line."
2874,I have been trying to get over a relationship breakup. I think I am making gradual progress but recently I feel as if I have hit yet another brick wall. I ask IC: what is stopping me from moving on? 46 unchangingThe judgement seems to be telling me to not doubt and fear but to take actions to  become more committed and involved - doesn't this contradict with my question of wanting to become less involved with my ex?  IC has suggested in previous divinations not to take any external obvious actions so I'm slightly confused
2875,"Hi allI am going through a very stressful appeal period where I am not sure what to do. I really wish to complete the appeal process so I can obtain a better grade. However, there are so many restrictions, one of which is the impending deadline. I asked the i jing oracle, how will my appeal process go - is there a high chance of success?I got 25,1,3,4>53Can anyone see if the hexagram strongly points to a yes?thank you"
2876,"I had the most frustrating dream where I desperately wanted to be alone, but nothing I did could make this happen!  Round and round I went, I even resorted to a bit of deviousness in order to be alone...but no...  nothing worked and I woke up in frustration.I asked the IC about my dream.  Lo and behold....and in it's amazing insight/uncanny wisdom, I suddenly realize the very bane of my existence:52.3 changing to 23.  I read this as stilling (ignoring?) my heart/desires/emotions is unhealthy when it leads to pain.  I have submerged myself into a stilling of these very things, hoping to find some semblance of peace and radical acceptance of the way it is.23:  Splitting Apart:  makes me think that the advice here is to ""shed"" those emotions/desires/source of pain.In research of this response, I read a wonderful thread in here started by Trojan regarding the frustrating fight of 52.3, with many thoughts and suggestions on this frustrating ""circular"" answer.   Stuck in a prison of my own heart and emotion is unhealthy.  Giving into them is unhealthy.  Getting rid of them is the answer.  However, if shedding them was an option, then would this not occur somewhat naturally prior to reaching the painful place of 52.3?  Isn't it human nature to lead ourselves away from pain?  If 23 were an option, would we ever be at 52.3?  And how to obtain a successful 23 of this, from the place of 52.3 anyway?  I'm asking questions that I do not think there are definite answers for, but my mind (or my heart?) must ask them...(ahhhhh, yet another frustrating inner situation!)So, I continue on to ask IC, what do I need to change in order move through 52.3 and accomplish 23?Response:  49, lines 5 and 6 -> 30.  I get so excited when I see 49!!  I think AHHHHHHH..finally, the transformation (of my heart, life, and mind) IS coming.  So, my efforts are not in vain after all?Lines 5 and 6:  discussing positive (authentic?) changes versus what I tend to look at (52.3) as, kind of like attempting superficial changes (the heart is fighting this change, so it's all in a sense, ""pretending"" and only fighting with itself).How do you create an authentic change when it fights against your nature or what seems to be your natural instinct?  If giving in isn't healthy (and I agree that it's not) and fighting against it creates pain and isn't healthy (obviously), then what???30 sounds wonderful  Gosh, I want to be 30!  If only I could successfully navigate myself there through all this painful pretending-to-change-my heart and authentically change itI see a circular pattern (of frustration!) here in these responses. AS though IC is just teasing me..and laughing at my frustration...ahhhhh you mean, mean IC,  you!Pardon me please as I ponder this circular thought and life pattern/process aloud here.....~Namaste~"
2877,"I'm really hoping for some interpretation help with this one!I asked IC what might happen if I choose to attend D's court setencing?Response:  Hexagram 5, lines 2 and 4 changing to 49.Interesting that I read an interpretation of line 2 that talks of ""observing"".  This sounds like going would be mostly positive?  yet line 4 talks of gossip and attacks.  This is truly a very real possibility and is evidence that the IC understands the nature of this situation.And then 49...transformation.... Hmmm.....I'm really not putting together the overall message with this response.  So, I asked IC what might happen if I choose not to attend this?Response:  Hexagram 50.  I really have no idea how to tie that into my question and really struggle to comprehend the larger, overall energies of 50 in general.I would be very grateful for some additional insight into these responses!~Namaste~"
2878,"hello everyone,I need some help with this reading.Briefly, it is a long, long story between a girl and I. We were in a relationship for 4.5 years that finished not in the best way it could have done. After years without talking each other we met again and decided to try to start a new friendship.So I decided to ask the I-ching: What should I do with her now?, and I got this answer: 51.3.6 leading to 30.May someone give me some light with this answer?Thanks to all"

My question was  "" please advise me on how I can help Y""  I got 39.4 going to 41I have a friend who is having a few problems , she is increasing being dissatified with her life and her boyfriend.  Now this is a woman with 2 little kids, she only works 1 day a week, so her moving out and supporting her children right now ... is out of the question.  I have been trying to support her , listening when she needs to vent.But last night... I recieved a frantic call from her boyfriend.. very upset on how she is treating him. So I called her to find out what was up... after talking with her, I became concern.  I was shocked at what she expected from this person ! Her demands were just way off the page of being cohernt.  I decided, just to listen and not say anything. An hour later... I got a call from her daugter ( 8 years old at 11:00pm ) telling me her mom was having chest pains... I called 911 and the boyfriend at that point. Ok... it was caused from stress. I believe is is severly depressed and am worried.Any insight would be appreciated... thank you"

2882,"Hello everyone, Last year (middle of '08), I ask the Yi when will I have some financial stability. I drew 53 with changing lines 1,5 and 6. I think I've read from Karcher to let the answers 'turn and move your heart'. This reading did.I thought those lines speak to every part of a major goal  I have - to finish college. 53.1'Geese approach the highlands'... I enrolled in an online degree. 53.5 'Woman does not get pregnant in three years'... Right now I'm feeling this, as if I'm achieving nothing. I did not enroll last semester because of financial difficulties. As much as I want to get a new job with a better pay, the present conditions (financial crisis) suggests for me to stay in my current job ( Yes. The Yi is reiterating this to me)53.6 'Geese reach the highlands. Feathers can be used for ceremonies again and again' (or the Way will  remain open to you again and again)...I still don't know about this one.Anyway a month before enrollment last year(last quarter)-- I got some answers that wasn't clear to me. Something like  'It's as if you're gonna lose some coins, but don't chase it, for it will return' (sorry I can't remember the hexagram, on the same degree I think I've read also about the line that says 'Losing a horse')In December '08, I felt impatient and confused with the events that happen. I started to importune -- ""If can't finish college, then what's my real purpose in life?' I got the same hexagram 53.1.5.6I've felt I have to trust the Oracle to 'not chase what I lose' and this 'will take time.' Right now it has been giving me nuances and shadings that I'm in a transition phase, 'To not impose my will.' I've read my Chinese horoscope for 2009 (Horse) and  it says the fruits of my labor can only be seen next year.  And some of my daily horoscope(Scorpio) has been giving signals of my situation too. Just like to know your thoughts."

2887,"While in the past the Yi has advised me to stay in my current job, I am beginning to experience a great deal of frustration with my current position.  Staff cuts have brought my team from 7 down to 3, I am now commuting long distances & am taking on a load of responsibilities that I'm not interested in professionally or personally.  I asked the Yi should I get another job.  First I received 16.2.3>32, which I took to mean that things aren't going to get better, the situation has turned to stone so start looking.  I asked again for confirmation and this time received 56.1.2.5>1.  56.1 seems a warning to NOT take any action, that if I 'split off from my place I grasp disaster'.  Line 2 speaks of 'acquiring a young vassal'.  Could this mean that budget will be found to hire a new employee?  Line 6, 'completion brings praise and mandate' seems like it could be read either as 'complete the job & you will receive praise & mandate' or 'stick out the job and you will receive praise & mandate'.  Any advice/insight is very much appreciated."
2888,"First off, this is my first time posting!  Hello y'all, and greetings from Texas!I have to say thank you to everyone who contributes here; I use an on-line program to cast my I-Ching quite regularly, and usually a simple search of these forums gives me the insight I need to interpret my reading for myself.  The last reading I did (just now  ) is a little more complex, though.  First off, I will relate just a little background info on the relationship in question.  Mr.X and I have known each other since grade school, and I've always had an enormous crush on him, but we haven't become friends until recently.  This friendship is remarkable to me and beyond anything I ever expected from him.  It turns out we are very similar people, with similar beliefs, personalities, and problems.  I know that he is interested in me physically, and although there are some (large) obstacles to the growth of our relationship, I believe we might have the opportunity to forge something great here if we decide to take it further.  Generally, we communicate on-line, and I do read my I-Ching when I have not yet decided what to message next.  This time, however, I took some advice I saw in another thread, and asked these questions (and got these responses):1. What is the relationship between X and I?  28.2.4.5.6 >> 522. What is my position in the relationship? 8.4.5 >> 163. What is his position in the relationship? 31.2.2 >> 48I would like opinions and interpretations, please! Also, I would be happy to provide further details, as this post is already too long to add more here!  Thanks for any reply."
2889,"Hi Folks, This is my first post here so please be gentle.Having recently been made redundant at a computer software company, I've found it difficult to find work in my own city due to the ""crisis"". It doesn't feel right to move my family to another city just for a job that will pay the bills, so I asked the Oracle:""Should I wait for a job I feel good about or should I move X city soon?""Which responded with Hexagram 47 / Oppression (Exhaustion), moving via lines 4 & 5 to Hexagram 7 / The Army.Now, 47 and the lines feel absolutely relevant to my current situation. At the moment my gut is telling me to stay, despite ongoing financial stress, but I can't figure out what ""The Army"" means. It has come up a few times in the past and it always stumps me.

2891,"Sometimes I really wonder about the IC....  Do you think it's possible to read its responses in a completely subjective way?  I'm starting to think for me it's not  That's quite a bummer because I enjoy thet thoughts and deeper reflection the IC prompts in me.I asked the IC today for some direction and insight into my love life...  a very vague question because it's a very vague area of my life right now, full of doubts, questions, fears, ex-drama, and all sorts of wacky stuff.  I'm currently on a mission to end a four year ongoing situation with my ex.  I'm working hard at acceptance of the past and trying to look forward to a new future minus the troubles surrounding that.  I've been stagnant for so long and I'm hoping the changes I'm creating will move to a more promising situation in the future...whatever that might be!IC response:  24.1 changing to 2.  I see 24 as return to myself, which makes total sense given my place in life right now.  Line 1 throws me off, as it almost seems to hint at coming back to him (ok, four years is enough, right?)?  I wish there were another person/relationship I could interpret this is indicating but again, I've got that ""4 years thing"" going on and there have been no other relationships.  And hex 2...  seems to intermitently surround my questions regarding my relationship with my ex.  On some level, this hex seems to regularly remind me of my devotion and receptivity (?)to him.  Yes, true, but precisely what I'm attempting to escape!!  Any additional insights into this response?

2893,"It's been a long time since I used the i-ching, and need some help putting it all together.

2894,"Hi,Since my late teens I have found it hard to socialise - in that I seem to lack the skill of banter, playing and functioning as an individual in a group (I'm fine one to one.. it's just groups must bring out my insecurities).  Though I get on well sometimes, with my housemates at the mo I am distinctly the odd fish..I am not relaxed with them and they probably aren't with me.  I rub along with them though and sometimes I share a laugh with them, but there's no real understanding or bond, unfortunately, because I do like them.  I just think I've put  myself with people who aren't on my wavelength and am perhaps just not suited to groups (a situation which has occurred (and caused hurt and dissolution) in the past)  Perhaps I still haven't learnt my lesson eh...  It's not so bad, but I am looking forward to being free of the awkwardness with them...I just wish it didn't render me quiet and reserved when I am with them, and thus I feel powerless.. I know you can't get on with everyone and it's not a major catastrophe, but I hope in the future to be more discerning.. because it would be great to find people I really am comfortable with and can get on with, and I know they are out there..Anyway I aksed What Should I be learning from my difficulties with my peers?32.1,2,5 > 4932.2 rings true 'With a stable character one acts in life, instead of reacting to feelings, impressions or people.'And 32.5 speaks of a character which hasn't been fully formed (I do lack a sense of who I am, and acceptance for that person though working on it )Changing to 49 - I'm never sure how to read that one. Is it alluding to a change that will eventually occur within?And for now I just have to endure feeling like the odd one out all the time?And 32.1 - I need to give myself time before I feel comfortable in my own, and with other people's skin?  It's just that it seems to come so easily to the people around me.Thanks.  I know it's not easy learning 'life lessons'... but if this reading suggests any practical approach, or reason as to why this theme has been such an issue for me then that'd be greatly appreciated.. Am I just fundamentally going against my Tao or true nature because of my ego's want of recognition and a sense of 'popularity'?:bows:"

I think this means - its been real -- and lets move on. I really don't want to indulge my fantasies in this anymore. Can anyone offer clarification? thanks."
2896,"Hello all,I was wondering if you could help me to understand this reading. The question is ""what is the current state of the relationship ""D-me"". I received 1.5 moving to 14. I have been looking in the forum for answers and they help, but I would appreciate your input on this particular question if possible.Thanks a lot!"
2897,I know I have posted a similar question here before but as you gather I am still struggling with breaking free from X so this evening I asked: what is the best course of action to break free from X? and I got Hexagram 10.1.3 moving to Hexagram 44.  I've been treading carefully and treading carefully and treading carefully for the last 11 months... can I actually break free from this man???  We have a child together and he just won't let us go...Please let me have your thoughts....
2898,"Help..I was invited to join a group for some drinks, though I don't know them all that well, and I suppose my gut was saying that because of that I shouldn't go - as I didn't want to feel awkward...  It's just that though they are aquaintances I like, I lack closeness so perhaps it wouldn't have been appropriate .. also practical reasons but I suppose mainly lack of confidence with the group in question.If I was self assured I would act on this and just not go - end of.  But because I constantly feel that I am not participating enough socially, I think I should push myself.. but often that makes things worse...Anyway I asked should I go?17.6 > 25Mixed impression - idea of being captured fits (being swept along blindly but not necessarily suitable for the act following?  Reflected in 25.6 - humiliation?  Which can happen if you're the relative stranger among close friends..  But then it also speaks of success and connection... Ambiguous so I asked again - Is there a place for me there tonight?43.1,3,4,5 > 7Is this sternly saying to break away from them, at least for toningt, and my need for self discipline when it comes to making decisions?  Especially in social situations.. I feel the pressure too much..Anyway I decided not to go.Would you say the readings support my decision?I know it's mentally unhealthy to be this indecisive about something trivial, but, when it comes to social situations I feel that I am prone to botch things up, because of distrust and self doubt.. and I guess a fear of losing face.. (I know 25 says to forget the ego, no ulterior motives, but here could it be saying I need to take control and not be too innocent as it could lead to humiliation?Thanks.  I could really do with help here.  My main prob in life seems to be knowing how to act in society.. and whether my instincts here are a result of past experience causing insecurity,, or the voice of instinct/ my nature which should be followed.."

2900,"Hi!I tried an experiment I have been up all night querying the I ching using random .org number generator.It seemed to give me all the right answers all night throwing away an answer every so often for fear of anomaly's in the static.But Since random noise cant be trusted in my mind just the same as random thinking and interference that might might go through ones head cant be trusted or one would not be sound I felt I needed to test the integrity of answers based on random noise filtered through the parameter cover of the king wen sequence.What interested me about this in the first place is that king wen sequence is proportioned like a wave maybe a time wave and it may have been supposedly designed to comprehensively pattern over chaotic noise in time.The way I set it up was from 1 to 384 lines I chose yang for possible yes and yin for probable no and I was getting uncanny results,but then I asked it the two computer riddle and it just crushed my enthusiasm for the old random auger.The two computer riddle I asked it was If the random number generator combined with the I ching were one of two computers one who always told the truth and one who always lied would the other computer tell me that this terminal lies?It said NO!4th line of 61.""Zhong Fu""Inner most sincerity-fourth six The moon is nearly full.A pair of horses,lost one.No Fault.I Find it poignant the subject is truthfullness and the yao text refers to a pair of horses one being lost sort of like saying a pair of computers one false or out or whatever lost.But it said yin probable no.Can anyone help me to refine this query,or instruct me in a more sound method of utilizing the ching?Last edited: Jan 10, 2009"
2901,"Hi,I'm having a little trouble deciding on what kind of career I'd be suited to following (I know it's probably a case of dabbling and then you find out) but I did a couple of readings on three possible avenues..  I think I am understanding which is more positive but feel a certain ambiguity too..  I asked which would be the best to follow?Option A43.6 > 1Seems creative, but in the second hex, and as there's only one line moving, looking mostly at the moving line (as recently learnt!)  43.6 - seems perhaps there is a hidden evil in this idea?Option B 30.5 > 13 (again only one line moving!)Hex 30 is always pleasing to see.. but 30.5 doesn't seem to be... is it saying it'll be harder work than I think but that I should remember in the end good fortue will come, or that I should have a change of heart?Option C15.1 > 3615.1 that this idea would be daunting to me now, as a small fox, and thus I should darken the light on the idea for now?I think option A and C would be the hardest to follow...  and I'm not sure how to read them, as all the moving lines seem ambiguous as to whether positive or negative (except 43.6 which does just seem negative)What are your impressions?Greatful for any input here.. and it's funny how we were just talking about readings where only one line moves!Ah.. synchronicity.. now there's a subject I'd like to follow!Last edited: Jan 20, 2009"

2903,"Hi all,I am trying to get some understanding of a particular situation that I am now in. An guidance that anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.I am currently recovering from a breakup of a long time relationship. I am attracted to someone. I am conflicted about this person due to a particular thing. I am finding that he has been and continues to watch me from a distance. We have spoken often and spent some time together. I have never asked him about watching me. I really don't want to open that door. I asked the I Ching why is he watching me and I received 36.2 to 11.  Should I be worried?"
2904,"Hi,I asked the Yi if a friendship I have, is strong enough, to support my moving to a foreign country and taking up a new and probably challenging job, where she will also be, with other friends she has there.We get on well mostly, and I do really like her but I'm not sure if I'd have a place out there, or if I'm suited to it..Anyway, i asked the yi Is our friendship strong enough for me to consider moving out there?40.1 > 54Is this saying I need to liberate/ deliver myself from her influence i.e it's my life do as i want to do? (though I'm not sure what that truly is at the mo0 Or is it saying liberate from the friendship as she has stronger partnerships elsewhere? (hex 54)  And perhaps it wouldn't be suited to me anyway?

2906,"I am new here but I was trying to learn from you, guys, in last few months. And excuse me for my bad school english grammar. I had a very, very bad period in my life from almost one year, I had to make difficult decisions about what I'm not yet convinced, but today I felt  like an wounded animal, like I have no power to continue. So I asked Yi what should I do in this case, and I received hex 23 changing to 12 and I don't understand what is the advice here...can you help me, please?"
2907,"Hello everyone...I'm new and quite humbled by these posts.  I'm in my 40s (married for 20 years) and in love with a man whose been married for 26 yrs.  Long story, but the feelings have been strong and mutual.  I've never experienced love for a man quite as powerfully, on so many different levels.He's very conservatively religious, and we haven't let things progress, although our bond seems to be intensifying on more subtle levels, and our friendship deepening.  Things seem kind of impossible, though.I've received hexagram 61 three times re. him in the past few days, which seems pretty significant.  I would love some help deciphering the meaning of this.The first question was ""Why is he confused about our relationship?"" I got 61.1.2 (changing to 20)The second yesterday was ""How does he feel about me?""I got 61, unchangingToday I asked ""What does he see the future of our relationship as being?'61.5.6 (changing to 19)What do you think?  Many thanks,trudi"
2908,Hello I asked today what I can expect to happen over the next 6 months and I received this hexagram with no moving lines.    My work situation is quite unstable ( and now my boss isn't even talking to me) and feel generally in an unsafe situation.I do relate to the image of the hexagram about water being blocked off like a damn as I have felt quite trapped in my job which is exasperated by the credit crunch which means I feel that I cannot move.  I also know that I deserve something better.I recently drew complete transformation hexagram 49 in relation to my work situation.I get the impression from this hexagram that I am going to be moving on (which is long overdue) but am concerned where to.Does this hexagram imply progress in a positive way?  I did not receive any moving lines.Thanks
2909,"I used these questions previously for someone else and I thought they might also work well on someone I know.  So I asked the I Ching ""what this person feels about the possibility of reconciling with me?"" and received 21.1.4.6 to 2. Then I asked ""what are my true feelings for this person?"" - 38.1.2.4 to 23. Then I asked ""what is this person's true feelings for me?"" - 14.3.4.6 to 19.  The last question was ""what is the proper course of action to take with this person?"" - 32.2.3 to 16.Sounds like this person doesn't want to try to make peace and that I am getting sick of trying on my own and waiting for them to meet me half way, but the last reading makes it seem like I shouldn't give up just yet.  I'm not sure though.  ??"
2910,"Hello all I have had many aha answers again recently.  Among them is the above but I'd also like to share another couple.I have been discussing the merit of the Yi with two very practically minded or intellectualizing people.  They maintain that for any given question, any given hexagram and moving line could relate.  I beg to differ - not least because of their difference in meaning and the detailed imagery, and I could imagine getting a reading to a question that was completely irrelevent... Suffice to say, unfortunatley I could not persuade them.  But later, I asked :On what principle do you work?58.3 > 43Which I read as saying the Yi encourages an inner joy in people which is not dependant on externals and so remains stable?  Changing to 43 perhaps saying that it is an attempt to break free from negativity or having a breakthrough, about the meaning of life and strivings of human nature (towards inner joy?)I then asked, to check:Are you mere probability?36.2 > 11Hmm I think plainly darken the light on that thought, it is not relevant, be at peace with the fact that it works.  And perhaps saying the striving of the Yi is towards redressing the balance in your unconcsious between Yin and Yang?  Thoughts?I have also been feeling socially awkward recently and am annoyed that it does return, even with people that I should trust as friends.  When I feel inhibited I immediately feel that I am letting down the other person, so I must try and make up for it. I just get painfully conscious when I am not talking and making the other relaxed and have a good time.  I know I shouldn't blame myself, it's probably normal to have these moments of distance with people, and remembering the good times should make up for it, but i just wish I didn't catastrophise so mcuh when I' feeling shy and uncomfortable, as it makes me behave unnaturally and I know it's a product of my desire to please all the time, which probably ends up making the other annoyed or uncomfortable...  then I feel like I want to spend time alone, which probably increases the alienation..I asked why am I feeling quiet and inhibited?63.2 > 5Perfect imagery!  Being more comfortable behind a veil because of a lack of confidence, but the demands of social life mean it is whipped off sometimes when I am not prepared?  This from Lise's site is good:6 at 2: Do not lose your dignity by chasing after your dignity. Just wait, and the things you deserve will come to you, because they belong to you. (Changes to hex.5)Perhaps suggesting I shouldn't force things or try to oppose and criticise my nature as I do?  I just can't help thinking when I'm being silent and reserved, it is boring and terrible.. but I know I'm not that way all the time.. I just go down sometimes and then self doubt creeps in..Any thoughts on the above readings?  I know the third one is a bit silly and I shouldn't dwell on the perceived failings of my character (which probably does just boil down to a tendency to introversion).Anyway very relevant readings, as always, so there sceptics :bows:Last edited: Jan 15, 2009"

2913,"dear friends,very recently I was strongly tempted to do sth about which i felt a bit uneasy cause it could be perceived as inconsistency or lack of integrity . . on the one hand i felt compeled to go ahead, on the other, held back . . it did make me wonder on the meanings of 'inconsistency' and 'integrity' within the context of change but this time i refrained from treading on the tail of ethics-instead i just asked:-'Yi, should I go forth with act x?': 18.5 to 57       "" Six in the fifth place means:Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.One meets with praise.I thought it was positive but still not so sure I asked:-'Yi, what do you think of x?': 26 unchangingand still again:-'What will be the effects of x?': 21.1.2.6 to 40          cut off toes, cut off nose, cut off ears?? I think Yi WAS grinding -it looked like i had my answers alreadySo I went ahead and did what I was thinking. But still I was upset with it and asked:-'How will people perceive x?': 13.3 to 25          Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the other,           plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar. We are           dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method.           Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. One           has mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent by           surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles in           his opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departs           further and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the more           alienated one becomes.seriously NOT GOOD huh? so of course there was one more coming:-'Is there reason to regret x?': 42.3 to 37        One is enriched through unfortunate events.No blame, if you are sincereAnd walk in the middle,And report with a seal to the prince.that seemed to set things right . . . but I am wondering if there is something serious here that I missed . .and because I do tend to get excessive in questioning actions, there was one last:-'Should I go on and discuss the issue?' :37 unchangingsince I often do not REALLY understand Yi's advice and sometimes it urges me to do things I wouldn't do on my own, I just resign in closing my eyes and just following . . but perhaps I've been blind to something grave??I would really like to listen to your takes on this  :bows:rodaki"
2914,"I found a few threads on this response and wow...it sounds like a really awesome response!  I am excited to receive such a delightful  response in answer to a question asked relating to my situation.  My question was regarding the best line of action for regarding a new relationship.  I'm not in a very ""healthy"" place to begin any type of relationship and have been submerged in a nasty relationship drama for a very long time that has become very toxic for me and its toxicity has prevented me from feeling able or willing to begin any new relationship endeavors.  Which in some sick twist of irony has kept me spinning around within the toxic relationship.  I have recently connected with an old friend whom I've known for YEARS in a simple, non-intimate, but respectful friendship/acquaintance.  He and I have recently spent some time together and the energy between us surprisingly (!!) seems to want to head in a romantic/intimate direction.  This is very unexpected for me!  ...And I am fearfully hesitant.  I am fearful because I have intentionally chosen not to allow any innocent ""bystanders"" into my life for for over three years now, out of fear of someone getting hurt in the madness of my situation.  I certainly do not want to be hurt as well and recognize my high degree of vulnerability.  So, for several reasons, this unexpected situation has me caught like a deer in headlightsPlease forgive my wordy explanation of this reading.  I'm concerned regarding receiving what seems a fantastic response (17.5.) but my fears are heightened when I contemplate what the resulting 51/shock might indicate?  I have a deep fear of hurting this man...as well as my own current vulnerability.  I am ready to run like the wind anyway and am trying to open myself to the concept of not running for a (refreshing)change.Any thoughts on this combination in regards to my situation?  I would really appreciate input/insight!Thank you:bows:"

I've already conntacted a professor, prepared the portfolio of works, written application and chosen referees. I was waiting for the references to send the whole thing when I got an information from a friend that a job opportunity had arisen in the same country.Now I don't know what to do: the postgrad course is supposed to start in September and this job is supposed to start in less than a month. If I get the job (and the chances are that I might since I meet all the necessary requirements) I cannot take the studies.But, even that is not the problem. The main thing is that I do not feel prepared to leave now, neither mentally nor physically, but I keep thinking - what if I miss something real and big (the job) for something that's not even sure yet (the postgraduate course).I've asked the IC what to do and got 10>30.I would appreciate any help possible.Thank you very much."

The result was Hexagram 37 (and, for the longer term I believe, Hexagram 53). So, I was hoping that someone could provide an objective interpretation of how they would read this.

2923,"I have a general question for those here with more experience than I.How do you interpret IC answers that seem to be completely unrelated to the question asked?  I usually can think about the interpretations, look around here for awhile at various relating threads and come up with some ideas to relate answers that don't seem to relate to what I've asked, but it sometimes seems the IC is answering something about other things that are heavy on my mind, instead of my question.  I typically feel I need to honor that the IC is addressing what it feels I need to look at, instead of what I'm officially asking.  In its wisdom,  this has always somehow made sense to me.However, I've asked a question related to an endeavor (""life calling""?) and the response doesn't seem to apply at all.  Do any of you have any advice on methods you use in these situations?  I believe the IC always answers the question, even if you've asked the wrong one.  I'd love some advice on how some of you conclude with this situation?!In case I'm missing something obvious, my question was what would happen if I choose to take on a creative writing endeavor...

2926,"Hello,I have been in a job for about 7 months now that I took cause it was what came along and I needed some work at the time.  It has been ok but it isn't something I had planned on doing for long and it is definitely not satisfying or interesting work.  I decided to stay for Christmas but I am not sure whether it is time to look for something else or stay with this job for a little longer.I asked the I Ching ""Should I look for a new job now?"" and received 12.1.4.5.6 to 24This seemed like it was saying that the time was right so I asked if I should look for work in the city I live in and got 21.4 to 27.Then I asked if I should look for work outside of the city I live in and got 2.6 to 23Finally, I asked if I should look for work that is outside of the country and got 29.2.4.5.6 to 35.The reason I asked that way is because I am pretty sick of this city and would like to leave even if only temporarily, but it seems to me that the I Ching wants me to stay here and find new work here.  Anyone that could give more detail or clarity to this would really be helping me out.  Cheers."

I asked the I ching about what he wants from me and the reponse was a combination of hex. 45 and 24.Yesterday I inquired the I ching again about why i had the feeling that he was leeting me down and got 52.4.5.6 to 31. Ok, he keeps his mouth still, but why? because there's no need for words?Thank you very much for your insight.Blessings,urbansparrow."
2932,"Yeah,Hi, everyone I'm new to IChing!So this a romance one. I wrote a poem for a guy I like. I know pretty sappy right? I don't know if I went overboard. I sent it to him. and I asked Iching how does the guy I like feel about the situation. We took a ""break"" in our relationship, but I still feel we have a thing.and I got Hexagram 33.1.6 retreat changing to hexagram 49 Ko(revolution).okay I asked again and I got Hexagram 18.6 changing to 46.what does this mean?Is this bad? Did I do something wrong? I'm so lost...Last edited: Jan 10, 2009"
2933,"I wonder if anyone can shed more light on this situation:Some years ago I met a lady who lives on another continent, and we became very good friends, corresponding regularly using email and msm and also by telephone.At one point she disappeared completely for a couple of months and it turned out that she had been ill - won't go into details, but her daughter picked up an email from me, replied to it, let me know what had happened and as soon as my friend was home she called.A few months ago, she told me that there was an illness in the family and our correspondence, understandably, became less frequent. Then it completely dried up. I sent her a Christmas present as usual, have emailed, sent a couple of snail mails and also called her - just on voicemail.  I don't want to pry, but we had such a great friendship and there had been no discord between us at all so I don't think she's ignoring me or that I have done anything to upset her. I am very worried about her. So I asked 'What has happened to <name>?'Answer 12.2.4.6 29It seems to me that she's facing a pretty big situation which is stopping her (obstruction), which she is dealing with but she's in right above her head and it's a headlong fall through a horrible situation. Does my understanding seem right?Thank you very much for your help."
2934,"Hi,In trying to learn more about IC and become more familiar with the hexagrams, I asked IC to give me some insight into my day today.Response: 21, line 3, changing to 30.  After reflecting a bit on what this message was for me personally, my feeling is that IC is referring to my persistent life situation/challenge.  Biting through my current (and seemingly chronic) limitations and aggravations in order to get to a better place (30) of unity both within myself and without.Interesting to me that the response seems so very closely related to my ongoing “drama” rather than just a general reading (or is this just in my subjective perspective?).  Ironic really, in that I have been intentionally trying to get my mind (and my heart!)to take a break from the worries and stresses related to those situations.  I’ve been hoping/praying that if I step away and take a break from all thoughts related to these, that my thinking and my intuition will regain its natural wisdom and balance.So, I cast again and asked about the ongoing drama itself.  In consideration of recent events between D and I, please give me insight into the next natural step on my path regarding that relationship?Response:  Hexagram 24, line 4, changing to 51.This response feels good, if I relate it to myself only.  Returning to myself and my own path, liberating myself from the influences of all these other things or at least keeping them in perspective……and that hopefully if I successfully follow that advice, then I’ll get to 51 (which I’m HOPING represents the great “shock” of finding myself again after this troublesome time and difficult life experience)This request for additional insight and help interpreting is certainly not urgent or dire. I  do think I have a good basic understanding of the message IC is giving me here, so this request for insight and help interpreting is merely in hopes for other opinions and thoughts that might open my eyes to any different interpretations of  these 2 separate, but related, readings.  So many here post for help on far more important issues, that I almost feel bad posting with this, but I thought I’d throw it out there anyway, just in case any of you have extra time, interest or just feel the inclination to pass on your insight.Thank you all for all your many kindnesses and patience with me as I learn and find my way in here…and in life in general.~Namaste~"
2935,"yes, the old relationship questions again.  but with some seriously intense hexagrams this time.background story:  i am dating a guy who i live apart from...long distance relationship.  we've been seeing each other for the past five months.  we just went on an amazing camping trip to maine for labor day weekend.  when we got back home, i told him that i loved him for the first time.  he responded with silence.  which i suppose is better then saying something you don't whole heartedly mean.  all the same, i was a little taken aback.  i was pretty sure he felt the same way...so i threw the i ching asking the question ""what is the true nature of X and my relationship."" and it gave me hexagram 54.2 - the marrying of the maiden moving into hexagram 51 - shock.  both are pretty strong cards.  and i wont lie and say that they don't scare me.  they scare me a lot.i've read that sometimes when girls ask relationship questions and come up with hexagram 54.2, that it generally means there is another woman involved.  and there is another woman that i feel threatened by.  she is his ex of a three year relationship which ended due to her cheating multiple times.  they have remained friends, and i know that it bothers him that i don't want anything to do with her.  however, the other weekend at a wedding she confessed her ""undying love for him.""  could it be that he's still in love with her?  but that is a whole different question and i digress.any words of advice/interpretation/warning for what is about to ""shock"" me would ease my already frazzled mind.Last edited: Sep 4, 2007"
2936,"What's the meaning of 1 unchanging in relation to a Yes/No question? Is it a Yes?(To be more specific, the question  was: ""When she called me, yesterday, she was in country X?"". She is my friend, she lives in another country, she called me yesterday, the number displayed on my phone was a number from country X (my country). I asked her about this, she said ""it must be the phone, I was home in country Y"". I'm pretty sure that when she called me she was not only in country X, i.e. my country, but also in my town. And I think 1 unchanging is a confirmation.)Last edited: Jan 7, 2009"
2937,"I've read through all the threads dealing with this line...and I'm still wondering... 31 means mutual attraction between the sexes. If this is the case, how can this be an answer to a simple yes or no question. Does the reading gives evaluation of situation? Because that is what it seems like to me. And the relating hexagram 32 is the out come of my move? If so is it positive. I cast the reading today at 10.00 pm.Any thoughts?"
2938,"Dear Clarity friendsHappy New Year to all.On January 1st I cast my hexagram for 2009; it is 42.2,3,5 leading to 26 (not sure about the relating hexagram right now). More or less, it is easy to understand the hexagram and the moving lines although there's always the possibility that I may be overlooking something. Since hexagram 42 clearly stipulates that one should make the best use of the opportune time while it lasts, I'd like to focus on the right attitude for it. I suppose that being receptive to opportunities etc. is one thing. Focusing on self-development or self-improvement is another. Perhaps the lines also point to the right attitude such as ""receptivity to and love of the good"" (line 2) or not letting unfortunate events deter you (line 3)? I was wondering if anyone could offer any suggestions regarding this matter. I'm sure that quite a few of you have experienced a 42 time at some period in your life and perhaps have something to add as to the right attitude in order to make the most of the time of increase. el_2"
2939,"I did a reading and got hexagram 25 changing to hexagram 9.  I need help interpreting as I am new to i ching.  Here's a little background.I have a friend who is someone that I think of as a best friend.  I am lately beginning to think that he might not feel that way though and I am wondering of he feels that way about me too, basically, does he care about me as much or am I wasting my time on our friendship?  I have had a rough few months and have had some friends totally screw me over and don't feel like going through that again.  So that was the basis of my reading was does he care about me as much/ is this friendship important to him?  I got a hexagram 25 with lines 2 and 3 old yin and line 4 old yang which changes it to hexagram 9.Thanks!"
2940,"Hi..Taking rosada's advice, I asked Yi what the reality of our (P's and me) connection was.15(1,4,5,6)-->13Hmmm..I dont know what to make of it. Any help is appreciated "

Is he going to be a good lover and companion to me?A. Hex 15 line 6. Excuse me, if it's telling me he's gonna be too ""modest"" to be ""good"", I'm throwing my towel in NOW.Unless anybody can offer a better explanation?Then I asked for some clarification of the above, and got hex 51 lines 2 and 4. Now, I tend to use the Dr Wang Yang and Jon Sandifer's (The Authentic I Ching, Watkins 2003) interpretation guidelines, in which case (in the particular case of hex 51 lines 2 and 4) one would only look at line 4. The interpretations for that one have varied from ""trouble all around you, but it will all come to nothing"" to Wilhelm's ""inner movement is mired and tough because things are not clear enough"".All thing being equal and it being the case of ""just another guy"", I would love to see what you think, because learning the I Ching's ways of answering any question is what makes it all worthwhile, regardless of whether the current squeeze lasts or not Many thanks and best wishes "

(Maybe a good place to transfer all the unrequited love eh Today was my last day at a job I have enjoyed, but felt wouldn't stretch me long term, and that I wasn't at my best in that role...  However, because I liked the people and environment I panicked today that perhaps leaving was a mistake and I should have tried harder...I asked: Was it a mistake to leave?56.2 The Wanderer > 50 The CaldronWowzer!  So so relevant - and reading previous posts with this line and mostly related to job q's!Encouraging line too I think   A great relief... although it is not at all clear to me at the mo where I am headed.. I am still treading water, but now with time and freedom (so far as the bank balance allows) I can attempt to apply myself more to reading and writing and finding work experience....  Perhaps 56.2 is reflecting that now's the time to get prepared at home before setting out?  I wonder if I will find the 'faithful trustworthy servant' mentioned in the line too... or maybe it's saying I'm not quite ready to strike out alone yet?I also asked Are my cover letter and CV ok to send out now?2.6 The Receptive > 23 Splitting ApartI have been drafting a letter for a while now (waiting for the green light to send it out as I don't want to put off potential employees with it)  But perhaps now is the time as I can't really afford to dither for too much longer...Initially I read 2 > 23 as saying send it out (disperse as in 23) and there will be reception... but then I guess it's going the other way round...  Line 2.6 mentions struggle... could my letter and CV be representing the light giving power of the dragon or do they need more work as they contain a dark injured element... Perhaps I need to revise them more...What is your interpretation here?The letter seems ok to me, but I don't know if it's too long and wordy... I don't want to seem pretentious or give too much away, or bore them, as the people receiving my applications will no doubt be busy...  I have had guidance from people which I have followed to a degree, and now wanted to ask the Yi if I have done all I can and should get the ball rolling... ?Or is it a warning that I shouldn't try to hard to push my fate?Thanks.V. grateful as ever for any thoughts:bows:Last edited: Jan 3, 2009"

But, what happens when we have been burned with fire once? Or perhaps, line 6 is indicating that one thinks that we can handle a situation because we've been before there and therefore, we go back to sleep, thus we lose our treasures. Maybe I am expecting the worst when I should not be taking it so seriously?

2949,"Hi to all of you,This is  my first post here, although I have been visiting this forum for some time. A friend of mine introduced to me I Ching two year ago but I started study it more serious about  6 months ago. Since I am a beginner, I try to be very cautions with using it.Yesterday I need to consult Yi, because I needed an insight regarding a situation between me and my significant other.  Before Christmas we had kind of a fight. I believe that one of us or both didn’t hear the other clearly so the discussion when hot ! We made up ( I didn’t want to continue the fight during Christmas time) but 2 days ago the subject came up again. We had a discussion that turned to another fight. Since then we haven’t talk but we have to talk about it when he will return from a business trip in a few days.  I thought to use that time to think again what is really going on between us and why this fight. So I asked what is the reality of that situation  : 20.6 >8Never had this line before so its not clear what it means. I see it as saying that this union is been observed from another lever  free of personal views ( more objectively )Give me an image of my behavior : 40.4 > 7I read it as I wanted to release  my emotions regarding that past fight because they didn’t make me feel free  to be as I wanted to be. Initially I didn’t want to speak about them for the sake of the peace  but them I decide to let the other knowgive me an image of his behavior : 55 no moving linesWell, does it says that his silence is a kind of punishment ?what to do from here on : 55.1 > 62Does that line says not to do anything, not to try to approach him again because its over ?As I said before , I’m a beginner and don’t feel comfortable with my interpretations.  Any help you can provide me, will be appreciatedThank youMulucp.s. sorry about my English because is not my mother tongue"
2950,"Hello all!I would appreciate help interpreting recent responses from the Yi. I have been overseas away from work for an extended period because of family issues and work has now insisted that I return or lose my job.  I have written to them stating my intention to return by a certain date and checked with the Yi about what I had written before sending the letter.  It said 42.2.6 > 60.  I am uncertain whether to understand this as:1) 'they are generous to begin with [or have already been generous] and then get mean towards me' or 2) 'things are really positive for me at first, but then I mess it up by being inconstant or ungenerous'.  I asked for clarification about this and got 18.5 >57Also 'Your advice about return to work'  received 44.2.4 >53Probably asked too many questions, or perhaps lost my mojo with the Yi, but am now thoroughly confused.  Any thoughts, insights would be welcome.thanks,lodro"
2951,"I am really worried about a friend of mine.  We haven't communicated much lately but when we do, I get the strangest sense that something is really wrong.  I tend to be very emotionally intuitive with people's emotional energies, so it's hard for me to believe I'm way off base about this.  When I've asked her, she either shrugs it off as nothing or she seems to tactfully change the subject.  I don't push on this type of thing so, when the feeling comes to me, I've been praying about it, hoping it will go away or even perhaps that I'm just wrong in my gut feeling...I asked the IC about this and received hexagram 29, lines 4 and 5 changing to hex 4.  Now, this is a very interesting response for several reasons!  My first thought is it confirms something is definitely going on with my friend.  After reflection though, I had to take into account that she actually works in a prison.  Therefore, could this response simply be telling me that this is a job related struggle and not some deep emotional ""bad spot""?"
2952,"I've asked the IC to give me advice on what would be a good next step in my life.  I am very lost and conflicted as to both what I actually want and as to what is right.Response:  Hexagram 38, lines 3 and 5, changing to Hexagram 1.38 seems to be about conflict, from the threads I've read in here.  I also found a great deal on one thread about about ""sin"" (don't really understand that!)  Gosh, sometimes I'm just thrust into awe all over again at the amazing ability of the IC to respond in ways that address the situation I ask about.  I think (stress the think part there please!) that I'm coming to understand the hexagrams better with every reading and just from being in here cruising around so muchHowever, I still often struggle when I ask the IC for advice.  Although I can see how this hex addresses my inner feelings, I can't seem to obtain the advice it's offering.  Is it offering advice or just acknowledging my situation?Anyone willing to help me with this response?Thank you so very much~Namaste~"

I mean, it is like letting a dangerous person go in my life and I will have to be aware of this danger all the time if I want to be something with her?Or has this line to do with me? I mean, I should not let the negative elements go into my mind, like hurry or ambition to speed up a good result for me?The question was focused on my doings, so I suppose it has more to do in the way I want it to be, than in what would she mean for me as a girlfriend.Thanks for your help.Txortx"
2959,Happy new year everybody!I hope your wishes come true for everyone this new year that start!I asked the I Ching for a message for this year and received 62.3.4 to 2... what do you read in this response?thanks a lot!
2960,"I am in a situation of choosing whether or not to move across the country...far, far from where I currently live and have lived most of my life.  There are a great deal of potential positives in the possibility of moving. For ex.: the economic climate in my area is one of the absolute worst in the U.S. right now, with little prospect for change to the better.  I've been stuck in a rut life-wise, job-wise, relatioship-wise for many years and moving so far away would necessitate change in some direction at least!  However, it is a HUGE move into the vast unknown and of course I give up many things as well, even with consideration of better possibilities...  I asked the IC about this move and the response was:  Hexagram 53 lines 2, 3 changing to 59.  Lines 2 and 3 directly contradict each other!  How to interpret which one is correct?  Even if I ignore the changing lines, I still don't get a clear feeling from the two hexagrams.  Any insights into this one?I also asked IC what would happen with my relationship with D if I make this move (aside from the obvious that I'd leave it behind physically!)  Response:  Hexagram 8,  line 2 changing to heagram 29.  This also confuses me.  Seems the resulting message is I should persevere, not to give up and/or not to run from these problems?  Yet, facing these issues within that relationship for so long has left me exhausted mentally and emotionally and in a sense, ""running away"" from that sounds appealing and at times seems to be the only valid way out of an enduring chaotic situation with few other alternatives.  Although, admittedly,  I seldom feel running from things is a good answer to anything, as issues seem to have a way of resurfacing wherever you might go and just coming from different sources...These are major choices facing me down right now and I would value any and all additional insight into these readings as possible!Thank you:bows:~Namaste~"
2961,"Hi , it's me again, with sort of  a technical question concerning the language the  I Ching  can be expected to use.There goes the example: i asked the oracle  what is it in the relationship with me that He likes the most?  and got     32.2.4 >15and i am now trying to figure out if  "" no game in the field"" can mean literally the absance of a game (tactics, strategies,etc).Given the overall positive context the answer is immersed in, i have a strog hunch that in this case it could be read literally, rather than indicating a lack of some ""it"" , of  the crux that would make the relationship viable.Another possibility is that  ""no game in the field"" that could appeal to him is that we do not live in the same city, which makes the field somewhat empty , and therefore possibly nice to him.Too far fetched, i think , but who knows?What do you think?"
2962,"Dear all,I asked if the goal I was hoping for can be achieved. It's out of my hands now, and I'm just waiting in anticipation for the results. I know perhaps some little things need to be tweaked; I need to seek out some of my course co-ordinators for it. But what does 58,1,2>45 mean? I take it to mean joy, as in let go and success will come? But what does 45 mean exactly?Thanks to anyone who can help."
2963,"There is someone I feel that I have unfinished business with but who doesn't answer any sort of attempts at contact and I give ample time for reply. I would like to come to some sort of reconciliation but I am not sure how that's possible as the situation stands.  So I asked the I Ching ""Why doesn't this person reply to or contact me?""  It answered with 44.3 to 6. Then I asked ""What is the best course of action to them with this person?"" and got 47.2.4.5 to 2.  In thinking about the first reading, as far as I can tell, this person just wants to leave it all behind because they feel talking about it will make it worse or just get us nowhere.  Maybe they feel that avoiding me is the wisest option in this situation and they are thinking of what's best for them.What I get from the second is that I should be patient and things will eventually get better, that I should be receptive and not assertive since further attempts to contact this person would just be mistrusted and ignored anyway. 47 definitely describes the situation between us but I am not sure whether the I Ching is suggesting that it is best for me to work on the situation because it will eventually be resolved somehow and the restrictions released or that it is best to leave it as it is and move on from it without any sort or reconciliation or closure because that is the only way to be freed from the exhaustion..Thanks.

After using it for some time I eventually expanded into other areas (runes, tarot, cartomancy, geomancy, astrology, horary astrology ... you name it) and slowly my connection with Yi fainted till I totally stopped using it (shame on me, I know) ending with losing the book. I moved from my old apartment and it's likely I'll never find it again, i.e. I'll have to buy another one.In the mean time I've  heard Yi 'calling me' after long time and this time I'm more 'mature' and serious about it. Only after reading this forum and opinions about plethora of Yi books on the market I'm aware that it's too easy to run into some 'new age yahoo' with his own ideas of how it 'should be' ... you know what I mean. First of all (and you'll see it yourself) Slavinski is deep into spiritual processing, he's been doing it for decades and from his other books it's clear that the man is hard thinker, takes everything seriously, emphasizes self-responsibility, has quite a healthy attitude for someone doing what he does, but then again his Yi book dates somewhere from the beginning of his 'spiritual' career. From what I remember it's very practical, straight to the point, not much philosophy with extra subcategories for each hexagram (love affairs, business, health ...) - ideal for someone struggling to figure out Wilhelm's ideas  My question was should I buy this book again and will it be good for me and my understanding of the matter => 63.2 > 5Obviously I'll have to put some hard work and study hard and this is ok and logical, but how good is it really?P.S. Anyone read this book? Any opinions?"

2967,"I have been following the swarm of small earthquakes in Yellowstone. They're right over the caldera, which is a basin caused by a gigantic volcanic explosion half a million years ago. Scientists expect that same supervolcano to erupt again at some point, which would be pretty devastating for our continent and for the world climate.ANYWAY. So I asked ""what will this swarm of small earthquakes lead to?"" and the answer was 51.3-23. ""Its subject keeping his loins at rest, and separating the ribs from the body below. The situation is perilous, and the heart glows with suppressed excitement.""AIYEEE.Of course it just occurred to me that I didn't give a time frame. Hopefully that will help me sleep tonight!"

I am not seeing how the judgment attaches to the question, so I thought about the names of the hexagram from various sources: Coming to Meet, Providing, Liaison.

How could this be interpreted?How can I find happiness in regard to my situation with Significant Other?53.2.5 to 18I am taking line 2 to mean I should spend more time with other people, with line 5 supporting this.18 initially seemed straight forward to me ""Work on what has been spoiled,"" but the more I think of it, the more I am not sure where it applies.

2969,"My friend and I sometimes discuss how we are both stuck, careerwise. Although there are some very positive aspects here- a good deal of warmth and shared qualities, I know I need to move ahead careerwise. I asked the iching- how can I incorporate this into our friendship, and received what i feel is a dismal response: 56- 33. When I asked for clarification, I received 10. Its true, when I tried to bring up recently what may be holding him back I got a bit stonewalled, and pointed out my own difficulties moving forward, I wonder is the iching letting me know to let this go and withdraw? I sometimes am too literal. I know this is possible for this friendship- which is important to me. Am I misinterpreting or asking the wrong question. Sorry for the lengthy post, your input and clarification would be appreciated."
2970,"I have just got an interesting answer from the I Ching , to my question about my boyfriend's feelings to me, after an aneasy time due to a row.I have children (which is what appears in hex 50.1). It is   hex 50.1.3.6 > 54.Hex 54 always makes me feel uneasy , in the best of options .Could it mean that the ""maiden"" who is given a secondary position in a relationship is him . as i am still in a relationship myself?I am much tempted to see the answer as something like: he (or we) need(s )to  remove old  stuff,unpleasant residuals from the heart, then purification comes, clarity of the resentments, and finally good feelings are restored (or  come into being).And thet would be in the context of finding his  own place in a situation he can't control much (54).Does this make any sense? Could you please make any comments on this possibility?"
2971,"I posted this question under a different thread about hexagram #51 and another member recommended placing it under a new thread to avoid confusion, so here is my question.  I am most interested in the meaning of hexagram 51 and how one can tell whether it gives direction to do something or to absolutely NOT do that something.I am a complete beginner at understanding how to interpret the i-ching, so I'm not sure I'm even framing my questions correctly - but I recently had a sudden change in a friendship and I am trying to determine how best to proceed. I moved halfway around the world and happened to make friends with someone 20 years younger than I am and suddenly on my birthday things became unusually tense. We had been laughing and joking, texting and talking several times a day, when suddenly - nothing. I sent him a text message - teasing, asking why he didn't say happy birthday (we were at work) and he replied that he thought I was trying to pick a fight. I didn't think that I was, and answered back that I had not meant to offend him - thought I was just joking around and haven't heard from him since. He is away on vacation for a month. So I had done a few i-ching casts (online) and before this occurred the 1st one I got Hexagram 24 ""Returning"" to my question about what kind of friendship we were in (my question was more about the age difference). Then on the day of the strange text message about my birthday, I cast again and got the exact same Hexagram #24 - Returning to a similar question, this time I asked if our friendship would continue. Today my question was very direct - Should I contact him or not? and I got Hexagram 51 - Shock. I'm thinking this is either a very strong YES or a very strong NO. Does anybody out there have an idea which it could be?If anyone responds with a directive - could you also tell me why?  The 2 answers I saw were opposite advice.  One said it is a strong yes, but didn't say why and the other said I should not contact him because of the meaning of 24, but I am more curious about the meaning of 51.  THANKS!!!"
2972,"Hi, fellow listers.  Hope you're having a good holiday season.  Sorry to disturb any revelries, but here's hoping you can help.I've worked on some ideas for a while, and shared them with someone in a position to make them happen.  When asked to present them, I asked the Yi what would be the best writing approach to take--you know, formal, informal, etc.  It said:29.4.5.6 changing to 64I really struggled with this--especially the 29.6!  How could there be evil in this?  As a matter of fact, it would be evil NOT to do it.  A few simple changes could save some people an awful lot of time and money.  I read through the archives here for quite some time, then finally took another lister's advice to ask about clarifying the last line.  I got:32.1.4.6 changing to 26Here, lines 1 and 6 again mention evil, with 4 saying there's no game, so that sounds pretty negative to me as well.  Sigh.There must be a lot more to this than I anticipated.  Can anyone share some ideas about how to take this?Nancy"
2973,"Hello all and Happy Holidays,I asked asked a few questions about a relationship , which Widowfox was so helpful in responding, . Those readings were right on .  I have decided to step back from the relationship, for the most part I found it to just to confusing for my taste.A little back ground.   We have been dating for about 5 months now,  it never really progressed to much.I honestly do not know why. When we spent time together it was great ! Never fought or anything.  He would confuse me.... when together, he was affectionate and caring. A lot of times tho, it seemed like he was rushing things, talk of marriage, moving in together ect..... the only problem with this was .. they were not consistant with his actions.  We would only see each other once a week, sometimes it would be every 2 weeks. ( I do need to be fair his job takes him out of town twice a week for overnight)His phone calls were random also.   He would call out of the blue and say things  like, we need to see each other more ... I really , really like you... talking fast and excited like.I was left with WTF  brought that on type feeling.  Then he would disappear for awhile.I did try and talk to him.. only got that he was stressed and having some problems.I just never could get on the same book with him, let alone the same page. Never knew what we were.  Bottom line was that he was way to hot... or way to cold... nothing in the middle.    So I told him, that he needed to work on what was stressing him out so much and I was stepping away. I did not end it for good... but for now.Right now.. am in the whatever happens ... happens mode.  I have been trying to get some insight as to what may of happen between us.1.   what was my role in the failure of my relationship with X ?                55 lines 1 & 5   to 312. What was X's role in the failure of our relationship ?    36  lines 3 & 6 to 273.   What was the situation that led to the failure of the relationship         53.4Thank you so much for your insights."
2974,"Seeking greater understanding as always, I did two I Ching readings today and would be grateful for any thoughts or insights!.My first question was (and most of you probably know I've asked a similar question before!!) what do I need to understand regarding my relationship with D?Response:  Hexagram 2 unchanging.​Question for general observation:  Is it possible that I intentionally created this hexagram?!??  Even as I asked the question and tossed the coins, Hexagram 2 came instantly to my mind, so I was surprised and yet not so much surprised when Hex 2 was indeed the response!  I have had this response to this question before and I think I do have some basic understanding of it, but I get the feeling that it's a very minimal comprehension.  Therefore, I do not know why I would be subconsciously wanting (?!??!!) this as a response, as there are other Hexagrams I feel I understand far better, but this felt very strange...as though this will always be my answer until I get a better grasp on what this Hex is trying to tell me!  Frustrating to be trying so hard to listen and understand and still not find that understanding.Second question:  What does the next year of my life have in store?Response:  Hexagram 14 line 5 changing to Hexagram 1.  After looking around here, this really seems to be a positive response, but I'm struggling to put it into context for myself and my life.Any help/ideas/thoughts are most welcome.  Please help me break through this ""wall"" and understand?Thank you all and blessings:bows:~Namaste~"
2975,"Hello all.I recently met an old work pal. He quitted some years ago and is now working independently, very successfully BTW.

2979,"Hi, Yi Sages and all the others who just like me are very interested but unfortunatly still very ignorant!I still have deep feelings for an ex. Not been able till now to forget him.Not overly proud of that but...that's the purest truth.We had a passionate relationship for 6 months in a row, then we just went separate ways without any sort of explanation (we are both very proud and stubburn) then after 1 year we were together again only for a moth and then again apart, just ""naturaly"", no explanations, no demands, just like that.We are at each other skype account still, so we can ""see"" when the other is or isn't online, but i decided 3 months ago to ""hide"", be in invisible mode, while he was most of the time ""away"", ""not available"", because i fell the need to not be ""exposed"". A few days ago i was briefly online, i showed up, if i may say so, just a few times, but of course my pride would let me take the iniciative of talking to him. But since then he is almost every time online...what that means and if it's connected with me i don't have the slightest clue, so i decided to ask the yi...and then ...you!I've also decided for some time now that if he does not make that move, i won't do it, i would let things unfold as the destiny wants. Sorry for so much details but maybe it can be relevant for the help that i'm seeking with your for interpreting this answers.I frequently make some questions about this situation but yesterday this ones baffled me:is he online permanently online now because of me? 23.1.6 > 24This answer seemed really weird. Ruin followed by return? i've read it somewhere in a brief seach in this forum that if the lines 1 and 6 change in a hexagram they sort of encapsulate the meaning of that hexagram so the relation to the relating hexagram is more quick. should this mean that after ruin comes another whole cycle? i'm sure you can empathise with my doubts.Will we be together again in january? 20.1.3.4.5.>30Maybe this stresses out the internet thing , seeing (20) view as a means of clinging (i had asked before how would things develop beetwen us and got 48.6 >57 and took it as slightly positive although not with a fixed date).And i also askedWhat should i know more about the developments between me and him till the 20>30 manifest itself? 46.1.2.3.4 >51!This one really scared me. I'm pushing too far my expectations so i will definetly have a shock in the end ? or step by step things will improve again until something shocking but in a good sense may come about (the ther times that we were together came all out of the blue, fyi).This post is far to long and apologise for that and i really hope i wasn't too boring - i could not find by search device here on clarity a conclusive answer to those readings.Of course i made other questions, but those i manage to get some sort of grasp over them. So i'm asking your help to see things more clearly and i really will appreciate your insights.Thank you very much in advance for your help and have a nice relaxing weekend!Joana"

2983,"I had applied for an online job last September.  Now this client of mine demanded too many things like a Hi def cam, dslr, studio lightings etc. before I can start working for him.  So I bought a cheaper hi def cam (I already own 2 DSLRs) and added some studio lighting.   Unfortunately, he was not satisfied with its outcome.  I back out of the job since I can’t afford to buy another videocam.  Then he offered to finance the cam so what else should I do but to grab his offer again.The plan was I will buy the cam online and he will send me the money to pay for it.He then asked for sample images taken from my DSLR.  But for reasons I don’t understand, he’s not happy with the sample images I send him and told me he will not send the money until I can show him “good” images.I have been in the business of photography for 8 years and this is the first time I met someone who can’t seem to like the pictures I’ve taken.  I find it strange since I send him sample photos before I applied for the job and he said he likes it.He sends me a few photos from a website that he want me to imitate the camera setting.  But when I checked, all the photos in that website were enhanced / manipulated in photoshop.BUT HE WON’T ALLOW ME TO USE PHOTOSHOP.To make this long (and very sad) story short, the 700USD videocam arrived and he sends me not a cent.  I am now very tight with my budget because of this.  I asked the iching for help ‘coz I’m thinking of selling the videocam while It is still good as new.  I asked… “When will I start working for (his name) and I got hex 27 as primary, 4th line changing and hex 21 as relating hexagram.What does it says?should I wait for work or just sell the cam?"

I've read several posts in here on this hex and have looked around online for additional insight into it as well....  and now I'm really confused!!  Amidst a myriad of thoughts and opinions, the only constant I found seems to be that this hex says to remain passive.  I'm a pretty passive person in general, so I struggle to think that the message here is to work toward being more so...gosh, I'd be a doormat    Also I read much about a spirituality aspect and also sexual energy, but .

2985,"Okay,  at the risk of appearing an absolute lunatic, I am compelled to post this for insight!!I had a very vivid dream last night that D (my not-so-ex-""ex"") and I were in travelling in a car - everything very average and normal as when any two people are riding in a car - talking, laughing, etc...  When sometime in the dream, I realize there is an infant in the back seat!!!!!!!!  In my dream, this wasn't unexpected or surprising.  The tiny baby was our child and  everything was ""normal"", if that makes any sense...In some way, this seems typical because throughout our relationship, having a child together was always the mutual choice we had agreed upon.  That was long ago though, before a great many unfortunate changes occurred and given the situation and circumstances, I'm wondering how in the heck did THAT dream come aboutConsulting the IC for insight, I received Hex 37 unchanging.I say to the IC,  Okay IC, I am absolutely perplexed.  What is the next step in my relationship with D?  IC responds with Hexagram 31, lines 4 and 6, changing to 53.  Okay, what the heck is THAT?I am perpetually torn between feeling compelled (literally) that this relationship in itself is a beautifully painful and necessary progression toward each of us eventually (heaven knows when though!!) overcoming all of the muck and mire that is us (now) and others and everything in between leading us back to the place of harmony and joy from which we started, only stronger because we have grown and learned so much together and separately through this experience.  My other feeling at times is that this is just bad karma with no one really at fault, intended to teach us a painful, but necessary lesson:  Go through it, suffer as necessary, learn grow, and move on...peacefully apart...perhaps like everlasting soul-twins, always united on some level through our love and friendship.  Cheesy cliche, yes, but oftentimes nothing else makes sense to me for the confounding endurance of this connection we both have.What the heck is this blasted relationship about anyway????

2987,"I don' thnk I have ever asked for help with a reading! I value the personal connection with the Yi and have relied on my intuition over the years. Many times I think that questioning others about understanding a reading can make it more confusing.after many years of using the Yi, I feel i have developed a kind of ""shorthand"" with my readings- and familiarity with my ding of meanings for a hex - and dont often feel the need to ponder a response. HOWEVER....... today I feel my shorthand might be shortsighted. and this is a matter ( question) that arouses deep emotion ( fearfulness ) in me, which can cloud my intuitive hit. BACKGROUND:I asked a question about pursuing legal action to get some money owed to me. I have two choices: I can NOT hire a lawyer and have some chance anyway of getting the full sum, because the sum owed is verifiable on public record.....and I could take legal measures on my own without an attorny by seeing a judge who ordered the amount due and who will supoena the defendant for an appearancethe complication is that the person is in california....I am in NY. he has changed his address and he isnt divugling it so there could be difficuty in serving him for an appearance.If he cant be found at a verifiable address, he cant be served, and the judge need to see us both in order to put money judgements on what's owed, amounting to a lien on any money he comes into. I might be able to get an address of some kind soon, and the court is also trying to locate him, but it seems uncertain .my second choice is to hire a lawyer who told me that for a flat rate, he could pursue this without even having an address, via legal location services, and get the judge to make the money I am owed into money judgements and then put a lien on the defendants income.I have comfirmed information that the defendant has won a lawsuit this month for which he will win 150,000. soon. it is at the tail end of the all the proceedings, and it was settled this weekendthe defendant called to say he would offer me 10,000 this month if I would sign off on the rest due to me. BUt the amount owed is double that and I dont want to settle for less, when he will have the means to pay the full amount. I think he is trying to bully me for as little as possible, because he knows I could get a warrant for his arrest if he doesnt pay, and that scares him. but he doesnt want to part with the whole owed sum, and he is trying to entice by saying I could have ten grand in two weeksMY questions: what if I hire a lawyer for this? 42.0what if i dont hire a lawyer? 55.4 > 36and finally.........what do i need to do about this lawsuit? 8.0I am stumped. does 42 mean increase for me..or expensive way to go.If I dont hire a lwyer, it seems there maybe some problems with him hiding the assets?BUT 8 really stumped me. To me it means Holding Strong, hold steady. Looking at wikiwing, I'd forgotten that 8 is a lot about unity, joining up with partnership....and dont delay! So it seems to me I ought to get the lawyer. My fear is that I will spend the money and find out later i didnt need to do that, or that something could go wrong and Ill be out that money too/CAn anyone give me their experieneces with hex 8? in terms of my question do you think it advises getting the lawyer? I think someof you may have your own valuable shorthand for hex 8, or personal experiences. it has never been one I understood all that well.please.....?"

Not a bad thing, right?  My reaction to this recurring hexagram's appearance is to keep reminding myself that patience is a virtue I admire and try to stay within that frame of thought.  So, I'm attempting to flex and expand my patience muscle regularly, if you will...Anyway, I'd love more insight and experience regarding this hexagram!  It must have a BIG necessary message for me and I certainly don't want to miss the point.Thank you all and blessings,Krista"
2990,"Hi How do you work out the timing in hex 49?I asked (after a visit with someone a couple of weeks ago) what happened?  49well we didn't have a fight or anything but maybe our first 'challenge' within the relationship - revolution but no dramajust to check I asked for an overview of said relationship and received 45.4 > 8well that's ok no? (I hope)! And then what do I need to know about the relationship 46.1 > 11 - teething pains that will be overcome with sincerity?On suspicion that this was as much about things in me and maybe my behaviour (and after exploring that with other readings) I asked what's the best way to deal with it?50.1.4 > 26  - I took that to mean work on the things in me [50.1] and how they then fuel my behaviour [50.4] but meanwhile hold firm. hold back and hold together.I assume the cauldron is me and my self development but maybe I'm wrong is it the love affair? And while constantly watching the memorising thread on 50 for clues - what's with the concubine and her son? I know she's in a low position but why the son? Does the son mean the concubine's got something the king will acknowledge?I asked if I would have the opportunity to 'put things right' ? 49On your own day you are believed  which seemed to confirm my suspicions that it was me that was the main 'trigger' then maybe how he dealt with it.I asked what was at the root of his reactions to me? 40.3 >32this one really foxes me I've wrestled with it for a fortnight..... and then I asked do we have a future? 49.2.3 > 58ok [49.2] things that aren't hard to change but need some time and [49.3] things that need co-operation but don't know if the answer is positive or not. And what are we talking about - a context of joyful communication?But (key point) all these 49's have timing as being the important part.  So I asked how do I know when the time is right?  17.5 > 51 What does that mean in this context? Revolution when it feels right...? That's a bit woolly!  Or...?So I don't expect anyone to answer them all I put them there as context but the key one is the 49's and the timing and the 40.3 > 32 (and the cauldron so often a mystery to me) and if anyone wants to elaborate or develop my other answers I'd really appreciate it.  I've really tried to study them before posting and a reality check from wiser folk is great.contributions would be much appreciated thanks LuciaLast edited: Dec 19, 2008"
2991,"Hi, I'd appreciate some insight into these readings around my career.I have the possibility of taking two different paths in my career.  One is working freelance on contract to support myself while I set up my business.  The other is focusing exclusively on the business but having little money.I asked Yi:1. What about looking for freelance work?  I got 39.3.6>202. What about focusing exclusively on my business idea?  I got 11.6>26Both seem to be showing struggle and difficulty with an opening up of things later.I'm sending my CV/Resume on spec to a company for some freelance work.  Firstly I asked:3. What will be the outcome of sending my CV/Resume to this company?  I received 40 unchanging.4. Then I asked how will my CV/Resume be received by this company?  I got 2.1.4>51Sounds positive but I'm not sure if its speaking about the general outlook of things around me or specifically about the work.Things are very challenging on the work and finances front at the moment so I decided to take on some temporary casual work while I looked for a freelance contract.  I started a job, worked 4 days over a 2 week period then it all dried up.  Then I got turned down for another casual job that I could have done with my eyes closed.  I don't understand why there seems to be so many obstacles in my way so I asked Yi:Why the difficulty with the temporary work? I got 34.6>14Future outlook sounds positive but I'm still not sure exactly what it means.Any feedback is much appreciated.Last edited: Dec 19, 2008"
2992,"WOW!  I'm learning that the IC is so accurate that it almost scares meDue to ongoing ""issues"" with my ex, I've chosen not to date anyone new for the past two years.  I was invited on a date for tonight...asked IC, ""What would come about if I go on this date?""   Response: 44, unchanging.  Wow!  This is exactly why I have NOT dated through this time!  I realize that I have nothing lasting to offer anyone right now, no depth of myself or sincerity because my heart is chained to another.  At the same time, my personal standards dictate that I am not willing to intimately connect with others on a purely physical or superficial basis, so I do not date.  Ironically, I fear that this also holds me back and adds to the links and strengthens the chains between my ex and I.  It's a catch-22!  Will I ever get used to the IC slapping me in the face with the very things I'm trying to avoidFurther frustrated with this response, I asked the IC, why are my ex and I so permanently bonded in both greatness and horror?  Response:  18, lines 1, 2, changing to 22.  I am still sitting here stunned, mouth hanging open with great reverance to the unbelievable accuracy of IC.  From the beginning of this relationship, I felt a connection with my ex's deceased mother, in spite of the fact that she passed when he was younger (and long before I ever knew him).  He even likened me to her on one occasion, with great respect and kindness to both me and her.  In addition, this response encourages my thoughts that the events which have occurred between us are karmic in nature, as they don't really make any sense otherwise or follow any kind of ""standard line of experience"".  Just not sure whether this is actually about our karma or more the whole ""sins of the fathers and mothers"" thing?  Was this always just some destined soul-mate tragedy waiting to happen?  Or is this more about paying for my own mistakes?  I've certainly made some terrible mistakes in my life!This furthers my struggle between believing in free-will or fate.  If this was marked for pain and heartache before it started, how on earth do I change that, stop it, learn the lesson, take my punishments and move on before the situation eats me alive and breaks my spirit completely?!Regardless, I'm struck in total awe of the insight of the IC and thought I would share my own sort of ""AHA""-type moment, even while my head spins to grasp this situation and these responses~Namaste~"
2993,I was wondering how to read 43.2.3.5.6 to 21 in response to the question Whats stopping me from going back to someone? Its a past relationship that I still feel strongly towards as does he but I haven't gone back to him even though we have been talking and he wants me too and I want to too in a way.  I don't know how to read the moving lines.
2994,"hi all, I have met someone special and it appears to be going well, I have consulted the I ching and asked if he will be a suitable partner for me and I have received 45 with lines 8,8,8,7,7,8 Any input appreciated thanks x"
2995,"I haven't participated in any of Hilary's courses yet so I may be asking something that is already known by you senior members or by the ones who have taken the course.I'd like to know your impressions ref. the time indications mentioned in the Yi texts (example: winter solstice, months according to the Chinese calendar etc)..Thanks in advance for your inputs."
2996,"Hello , i'm trying to figure out the meaning of hex 44.4.6 > 48 i got referring to a relationship issue, namely the results of my going to meet sb i met a couple of weeks ago, after some turbulances we have had to come together due to rather incompatible timetables.This hexagram has always blown my mind, is it about a woman who is to be feared or at least not suitable for a harmonious relationship, or (in this case) is it about complementary opposites who come to meet each other driven by natural ,mutual attraction?Adittional clues : his intentions towards me -  hex 45 unchanged, his feelings ( this question may be tricky , i know) - hex 45 unchanged.I also asked about the meaning this date has  for him and got hex 55.1.4.5>39 What makes the reading difficult is this fairly dim outlook ( an empty tank, edgy attitudes)of hex 44 against the potentially spiritual bondage that hex 45 is envisioning.I would really appreciate your opinions."
2997,"Hello all, my first post.I'm 'having an issue' with my wife. It's not that bad and not that 'sky is falling down' but it's very annoying. Since I was already familiar with Yi (used to have lots of fun in the past) I somehow remembered of this fascinating tool and decided to knock the rust off and start using it again and for good. Instead of asking ""what will happen ..."" I took a different route and asked for advice: ""What must I do and how to behave in order to regain harmony while not sacrificing my own dignity?"" (Btw, was my question too complicated?)Anyways, the answer was 61.1.3 to 57 and I'm not really sure what exactly I'm supposed to do."
2998,"Hi there, does anyone have any experience with hexagram 34 lines 5 and 6?  I asked the Yi what is the best course of action with regards to ex (in order to break free, to be able to move on as opposed to get back together - was at the back of my mind)Any comments would be highly appreciated!"

What should I do re my old school friends over Christmas?( I will be returning home, and so they will be around, but they have rejected me in the past which still hurts, but to be honest I think the hole they left has been mostly healed over now, but I guess I just crave for things to return to being friendly as they were years ago... bridge the gap but I don't know if I am capable, or they willing.. perhaps it's too late to even consider a return to that social circle... and it would be another show of my putting myself down, by going after people who are indifferent...I received12.1 > 25Pretty clear?  To try and put yourself out there again with them would lead to humiliation so don't go there.. or at least don't instigate it.. remain unexpectant of anything from them?I guess the reason I am still willing, despite their treatment of me in the past, is because I share history with them - my childhood! and good times, though more bad in the recent past...

3002,"Hello Everyone,firstly, I am happy to be here and to have found this forum!I have been casting and using the I ching for a while now and find it to be the most accurate form of divination I have ever experienced. That is.....when I am sure to interpret the readings correctly.So, after doing around 200 different i ching readings I got Hexagram 51, Shock for the first time two days ago and then, got it AGAIN today regarding the same issue.It is about a man.I asked a question about a man's (who i care about) possible infatuation with me and I got Hexagram for Harmony.For some reason I felt that the i ching was trying to tell me that I could be dealing with something deeper than infatuation so I breated deeply and dared to ask:""Is he already in love with me?"" That is when I got Hexagram 51, Shock..for the first time.Today, something external happened that I feel will draw his attention to me. So I cast again and I asked, ""What will soon be his feelings for me?"" and I got it again! Hexagram 51!Could someone help me understand this?Recently I also got Hexagram 30, ""clinging like fire"" when I asked ""what is it he truly wants from me"". But I took that to mean that he wants me to ""cling"" to him, but not necessarily because he feels for me. Have I underestimated things?Please, can someone help me understand what this Hexagram 51, Shock, is trying to tell me?The result: Hexagram 51 Shock had a changing line, the changing line was 6The full reading also provided a future hexagram related to this one, it was Hexagram 21, Cutting through..which from what I understand implies an awareness of truth, of what reality is and means getting past previous misunderstandings."
3003,"Hello, Would you please help me to understand this reading? I asked what is going to happen between my love interest and I and received 1.3.4 changing to 61.What do you think of this?Many thanks!Milla"
3004,"Hello to everyoneI am in panic because I have asked a question related to personal matter and I got 29 ->59. I have asked ""Did I do well when I asked him not to call me again?""The answer was terrifying when I read other posts. Any light here please?"
3005,"Thank you all for your great wisdom.Here is my question: What may I expect if I now consider myself retired from my business? (I am older now and there is not sufficient work available in my field anyway.) But I don't have enough money coming in on a regular basis. I was thinking I could always ask a family member for money, as I am fortunate to have a family member with money.  Anyway, I got 26.2.6>36. I have to admit that hexagram 26 often mystifies me and that I didn't understand this answer. I have gotten #26 a lot over the years. As background, I have asked my family for money in the past, and they have a few times caused me trouble in the form of severe thwarting, because they hardly ever agree with my plans and activities. But what about that top line moving: ""One attains the way of Heaven."" Does that mean that I correct my ideas? So, I asked the reverse question: ""I Ching, what may I expect if I do not subordinate myself to family members but still persist at trying to earn my own bread?""I received hexagram 50, The Cauldron, with no moving lines.I get static hex 50 a lot. It's a visual image of a big pot, of course, and I take it that I am supposed to keep its contents stirred and bubbling so as to feed not only myself but all the worthy. Hex 50 with no moving lines is said by R.L.Wing to mean: ""those with whom you are associated, as well as yourself, will attain success. . . . Your entire milieu, whether it is religious, social, political, or familial is developing in accord with the cosmos."" That sounds wonderful, but I have to say, it is also more than a little bit nebulous. To achieve success with hex 50, one needs to be rather selfless, and I'm afraid I'm always thinking about how I'm going to pay my dentist, and so forth, like most of us . . . especially since right now I have a toothache. Here in the USA, you know, dentistry is usually not covered under our medical insurance. What a pain! Any help you might be able to give would be very much appreciated."
3006,"I received an email from someome that was quite upsetting.I got 62.4-15According to Wilhelm the line's advice is not to do anything, but to persevere inwardly.from his comments:The situation here calls for extreme caution; one must make no attempt of one's own initiative to reach the desired end. And if one were to go on, endeavoring one must be on guard and not act but continue inwardly to persevere.I will be seeing this person for Christmas, so I can follow the advice of not replying, but it will be akward seeing them at Christmas.It also seems to say to be on guard and maybe not to take the initiative to reconcile with this person? Inwardly persevere: Why does it mention this? Does anyone have any insight about this reading?"
3007,"Hello Everyone,I have used to I Ching for many years now.  Though I have rarely used it as a means of divination.  I usually just open the book up to a random page and read about the hexagram to gain knowledge.  As of yet, I haven't downloaded the material, Hilary, provided.  I hope to download it today to gain more knowledge on divination.  The main reason I'm posting this thread is I came up with the hexagram 18. Ku/ Work on What Has Been Spoiled.  I am a student of Tai-Chi, Hsing-Yi, and Pa-Kua.  I have let my training lapse for several years.  What does the hexagram mean to you in response to my situation?  I take it to mean careful fore thought [deliberation] must be used first before proceeding forward.  In that way I could avoid a repeat of my situation.Dean:bows:"
3008,"All the moving lines do not read favorably. Does X want a child with Y? Recently X has been reading on babies and childbirth. 24, speaks of return, and 35 speaks of progress. Do we look at 35 to indicate a yes answer, or the moving lines on 24 that indicates a no? Both X and Y have seperated for a while, probably this mirrors the hexagram 24 of return. What do you suggest?"
3009,"I've been going on dates with lots of guys (JUST dinner or movies, I'm not promiscuous) but none of these guys have been what I was looking for. It made me feel really down.Finally I have met someone that I really like! I poked him on Facebook because his profile picture made me laugh and we have some shared friends but he and I never met. I was surprised that he wrote me back but even more surprised when we started chatting because we have some really  unique things in common. Like we both study buddhism, like the same things..and there's just this feeling of serendipity about it.So we write each other but at first he teased me that he didn't think I was real because a girl interested in the same things as him, who he thinks is pretty and so on..he said, ""are you sure you're real?

3010,"I asked this question a couple of weeks ago, and re-read it a couple of times. I am curious to get other opinions.I felt a disturbing influence from a female colleague at work, with whom i had an affair but ended it. I asked how is it favorable to act towards her."
3011,"(...Big sigh...)  Again I'm here asking for interpretation advice...  and I apologize in advance for my lengthy description surrounding this reading!!I have attempted a final resolution on all issues surrounding a relationship which is very dear to my heart.  I've said goodbye in as peaceful and loving way as I know how while still maintaining my truth and sincerity:  a card and letter filled with gratitude for all things beautiful and encouragement, while also setting firm boundaries (unfortunately, the boundaries part was NOT my favorite part, but very necessary in these circumstances).  Wishing I could feel content with that and not worry and fret needlessly over whether it was the correct choice/action.  Action done.  Choice made.  Boundary set.  Right?Sensing all sorts of negative energies.  Overwhelming actually....  and I'm frustrated that even my kindest and most sincere attempts at establishing peaceful acceptance feels surrounded by others in bitterness and hateful intention.  As though nothing I do at this point will be considered anything positive, no matter how sincere my emotions.  It's beyond my control and it shouldn't matter, but this situation was sabotaged by others (not he nor I, but ""others"" altogether) from the very beginning.  After everything, it's painful to try to just accept that no amount of pure intent or sincerity might overcome the senseless and hateful negativity others have submerged this entire situation in!  Anyway...  looking for hope and encouragement regarding my choices, I asked IC:What energies currently surround the letter I sent?  Hexagram 45, lines 2 and 6 changing to hexagram 6.  Yes, this makes sense of the gut feelings I've been getting and fighting.  Not encouraging, no, but validating, YES...So, this situation being so very close to my heart, I then asked, What is beyond this negativity?  Hexagram 58, lines 4 and 5, changing to 19.Well, it seems this is some encouragement that my sincerity might not be totally lost in this situation.  Or am I just reading into it what I want to see?I would be ever grateful for as much insight and interpretation with these two readings as the kindness of those wiser (and more subjective!) are willing to offerAs always, I'm so grateful for the kindness you all offer in taking your time to read, help, and respond.  Gosh, life's big lessons and experiences sure can be difficult and overwhelming!

3012,"Hello dear people,I am having some struggle with money lately... like so many of us! This month has been specially difficult so far as I am struggling to pay my rent and other vital bills. I started working independently some time ago and money has not come easily lately. I really like what I am doing and would love to keep with my current plans, but money still is not coming... I asked to the I Ching ""what if I go to look for a job? Is it what I need to do?"" and its response was 29.1.3 moving to 5. For what I was reading, it seems to me that the advice is wait, not do anything at the moment... Is it?Then I asked ""what if I keep my current working plan, is it what I need to do?""  and its response was 29.1.2, moving to 3. It was interesting to receive the same hexagram for these questions, and I think it is reflecting my inner state about the situation itself. I am not sure about the advice here. I asked one last question ""what do I need to do in order to increase my income constantly"" and the response was 7.4 moving to 40. Well, I will really appreciate your input on these readings... perhaps I can find a solution. Thank you very much,Dani"

My question was ""what's gonna happen between us"" as at the moment I am in a situation where I do feel like following the tiger tail with this person, and when I read line 3 it seems to be like getting caught by the tiger, while line 5 talks about going ahead with caution. I do feel I have some stormy feelings about this person and I hope I can release them as I consider this person as a person who has always been good to me. I asked about this as well...

3016,I asked a series of questions to try to get a holistic view of what I am going through but I just got more confused. There are several options I could take in my love life: going back to one of two past relationships; having a fun and light kind of affair; going with the flow and waiting to see what happens; or focusing on being alone for now.  Here are my readings:What am I doing right in my love life?29.6 to 59 (one of the very confusing ones since I'm not sure how line 6 could be positive)What am I doing wrong in my love life?10.1.2.4 to 20 What is the proper thing to do in my love life?19.2 to 24 Who should I return to?12.4.5 to 23How can I fulfill this approach and return?11.2 to 36For further development I asked about the specific people involved.Should I return to A?33.4.6 to 39What is the proper thing to do with A?20.5 to 23Should I return to B?10.2.4.5 to 27What is the proper thing to do with B?52.6 to 15What is the proper thing to do with C?59.2.5.6 to 2That's a lot of questions.

3017,"Hi,I'm facing what could be a difficult confrontation with management at my company. After my boss left the company six months ago, I took over editing a magazine on an interim basis, but haven't received a formal promotion. I'm starting to get a gut feeling that the management has no intention of promoting me in a way that would be fair and asked the YI about my situation. I got 43 (breakthrough) line 2, changing to 49 (Revolution). Sounds like I indeed have a battle ahead. I am feeling tempted to just leave and move on to work on more rewarding freelance projects, as I have a side job I enjoy very much and could be a primary gig if I put more time into it. What I can't figure out is: would it be worth battling to the bitter end to secure a fair deal at my day job, or just separate myself from it and make a radical career change?

3020,"I was wondering what other people's experiences might be when receiving this hexagram.  I read the blog on this site entitled ""what does he feel about me?"" and decided to ask the question differently about the boy on my mind (I go into exhaustive detail about the situation in the thread ""Take Two"").  So this time I asked ""what does he need from me?"" and 1.2 appeared which then turns into 13.It sounded like a very familiar combination, so I turned back to previous pages in my journal and there, lo and behold was the exact same combination for a question on the nature of dynamics between the two of us TWO MONTHS EARLIER.  That happens quite a bit, actually.  32 comes up quite a bit as well, though there does seem to be debate as to whether it means ""everlasting union"" or ""keeping the status quo.""Has anyone ever asked about a relationship and kept getting 1 as a response?

3025,"Hello all, Perhaps you can clarify this situation.I have broken up with someone a while ago (10 months ago). Yet, I still think about him. I have gone on dates with others, but can't stop thinking about him. Everytime (and that's been going on for the past two months) I have asked the I ching what were the chances of us dating each other again, I get either 11 line 5 (four times so far), 15 line 3 (three times so far), and 63 line 2 (three times so far).Today, I asked the I ching another question. What does he think about us getting back together. And I received 19 line 2. Now, is the I ching just giving me good answers because it is getting tired of me asking about the same guy, or is there going to be some miraculous change of events?I mean, he has been friendly with me lately, but I wouldn't think much about it. I wonder if I really made it clear when I asked my questions to the I ching that what I desire is an actual romantic relationship with him.Any answer would help. I don't want to lose my belief in the I ching.Thanks!"
3026,"Hi, Re the long term role of someone in my life 22.3, 4 Grace - 21 Biting ThroughDoes this reading say that there isn't physical attraction, and maybe I am deluded as to the relationship's importance and it is one sided (line 1) or that there is something there and the person in question is attracted to me in some way, or at least gets something from me too (line 4)?And would you read Biting Through as my effort should be in getting over it and moving on and away from the influence?  Or that the relationship will bite through what is lacking, and remain in my life as a positive eventually?Would really appreciate objectivity on this one, because though I'm trying not to, I can't let go of the idea that though the relationship isn't perfect, it is nevertheless special.. But i don't know if I'm kidding myself now, on all levels (friendship or otherwise...)Thanks.:bows:"
3027,"Dear all.Would you please share your impressions with me on the following?I'm trying to find out whether a work colleague got angry with me due to my absence in an event. I got 61.6 changing to 58.In order to narrow the reply I asked if I'd rather go to him for a frank talk and got again hex.58.I'm sometimes confused whether Yi's responses are direct (like a yes or a no) or whether it shows the full picture and something else too (e.g. ""You should be or do more of this or that..."").Thanks in advance.Mary F."
3028,"I'm applying for a new work contract which seems very interesting and is very well paid.  Its a little above my experience but in general I've got most of what they're asking for.  I felt quite excited about it, though a little dauted, as it would be going into a new area for me.  There would be a bit of a learning curve but I would have a lot to contribute and it would allow me to really expand in new directions.  So I was surprised to get 61.6>60 in answer to my question,'how likely am I to get this contract?'I then asked, 'what about sending in my CV?' and got 1.1>44 - I'm still confused.So I asked again, 'what is the best course of action to take regarding this work?' and got 45.3.5>62.The deadline's tomorrow and I guess I what I really want to know is should I apply for the contract or not?"

Therefore he must take care to remain upright and steadfast, so that he sojourns only in the proper places, associating only with good people. Then he has good fortune and can go his way unmolested.Thanks for your help "
3030,"Hello all!If anyone has read my previous post of a budding romance with a man who has come back to my life will know that I had planned on making things happen at a work banquet we had this past weekend. However, I felt really sick and had to leave early. I found out the next day the cause for my sickness...I am unexpectedly pregnant from a previous relationship that had ended. This obviously changes everything and I am still dealing with the emotions I am feeling. I turned to the I ching to help with some questions that have come up in my mind about this situation.I asked what is the meaning of me getting pregnant like this? 11.4 to 34i have no idea what this meansI asked what do I need to know about this pregnancy? 52.6 to 15It seems I am in for a lot of sadnessI asked what impact will this baby have on my life? 63.3.4.5 to 51well, the shock is self explanatory and from the lines I gather that my standard of living is going to go down hill. This makes sense, I am known for my designer clothes and being well put together but since I am going to be a single mother things are obviously going to changeI also asked how X (the man in my budding romance) is going to feel when he finds out I am pregnant. The answer was 56.4.5.6 to 39.  I guess he is not going to be happy about the obstruction (the baby)and finally I asked, how will this baby affect the possiblity of a romantic relationship with X? 59.2 to 20. I don't know how to interpret this at all actuallyi am sorry for asking for help on so many questions but my mind is just completely upside down right now... any thoughts will be greatly appreciated! thanks!"
3031,"The question regarding a relationship was ""what does he want from me?""54.4 to 19Hex 54 Marrying Maiden/Hex 19 ApproachI see it does refer to marriage, a late marriage. But I know not to take the yi too literally so any interpretations would be helpful.  Thanks!"

3033,"I asked the IC what is I need to do involving my relationship with my ex.  I still love him very much, but I fluctuate constantly on what I want and how I should proceed (or not proceed) in regards to this man and our relationship.  I have been choosing to step back considerably from him.  However, in stepping back so much, it seems as if the energy surrounding this situation has amplified (if that even makes any sense to anyone?!?).  I am definitely more peaceful in my thoughts regarding it all and I'm so grateful for that.  I have resigned myself to ""what will,  be will be"" and just allow myself to go with the natural flow of my feelings and the situations which arise.  However, I'm now in a situation where I have to make some significant life choices and in reflecting on the choices, my thoughts keep going back to him.  I think I need to discover what that relationship is all about and what is its purpose and future might be before I feel comfortable making such choices, but I'm terribly confused as to what I want and what the best course in general is for me regarding this situation!  IC told me Hexagram 1 with lines 2,3,4, 5, 6 changing to Hexagram 24.Not at all what I was expecting and I don't understand the message!  In addition, I asked IC for insight regarding his position and feelings about our relationship and IC said  Hexagram 20, line 4, changing to 12.  From my limited knowledge, that sounds terrible!!I welcome any insight into what IC is telling me about  this confounding ever-changing situation.Thank you:bows:"
3034,"I asked the I Ching about a certain person and whether I should continue contact with them and make plans towards progressing our relationship or whether I should remove them from my life. Its kind of an all or nothing situation.If I should break off contact, I received 48.2.3.5 to 2If I should stay in contact and further the relationship, I received 9.1.3.5.6 to 7."
3035,"I originally posted this as a reply but after checking neurotically for two hours I think I will try it as a new thread and see what happens--<<Then I'm confused. I'll try to keep it short, but basically, I had a passionate affair with someone I worked with. I was married and he had a long term/live in girlfriend. I ended my marriage and moved out. He didn't end his relationship with his girlfriend (didn't tell her either though it was very obvious that she knew what was going on) and then was posted to do his teacher training in New Caledonia (a tiny island beyond Australia and New Zealand), something that was conveniently arranged by his girlfriend's father, so they both went there together (the girlfriend's father lives there). Things are/were very much up in the air between the two of us. At first we wrote, called and emailed constantly then I got a bit nervous and said that I didn't want any more contact. That lasted about a week as both of us were miserable. Now we text three/four times a week--I only respond to him, just about his teacher training and what's going on in school for me, cheerful and chatty. I am trying hard not to keep my internal eye on his situation but his training will finish in 2009 at the end of the school year and I do wonder what might happen and what direction the situation will go in....Here are some of the readings I've doneThe final outcome of he and I45 (Gathering Together) to 32 (Duration)The final outcome of he and his girlfriend54 (The Marrying Maiden) to 49 (Revolution/Molting)What his time is like in New Caledonia48 (the Well) to 36 (Darkening of the Light)What will happen to he and I when he finishes his training34 (Great Power) to 5 (Waiting)What will happen to he and his girlfriend when he finishes his training38 (Opposition) to 17 (Following)As you can probably guess, getting Following (17) for he and his girlfriend really bothered me, as she has done exactly that... followed him around while he gets trained up in his brilliant career. And on the surface, it says more of the same. But some interpretations seem to say that Following is more about following your own truth and following your real self, no matter how difficult that is. And I know, at least for the time that we were together, there was true love between us. It was and is a life changing relationship, for the both of us. Now that he is on the other side of the world and we are texting politely and carefully to one another, doubts have begun to creep in. Would really appreciate your thoughts but be gentle-- I am so caught up with this!Thanks xx>>"
3036,"I'm so pleased to have found this community!  I have been consulting the I Ching in one way or another ever since I was in eighth grade!  It has been something that I have turned to in times of real crisis and I'm sure like everyone here, the guidance has been spookily accurate.  But here's the rub-- can it foretell the future?For example, if I ask a question like ""what will be the final outcome of this relationship or association with this person?"" and I get 45 (gathering together) which changes to 32 (duration)... does that work far into the future?  or, since I asked the question in May of this year, have those things already come to pass?I have asked questions giving specific time dates (in a year's time, etc) and had the I Ching predict things very accurately.  But now that I am reading in more depth and detail about the oracle, most people tend to say that it gives you a reading for the present and the near future, nothing else.  What do others think about this?"
3037,"A friend of mine awaits their results for their examinations. They asked if they will receive the results they reckon upon. This hexagram is quite confusing. Why the shock (51.3), and culminating into 55, does it mean yes, or no? Related posts mention that 55 lasts only for a short while. What does this mean with regards to the results they will get?thank you again."
3038,"Hey everyone, In need of help with a legal issue. I have recently enlisted the help of a new attorney, who says he's making progress. I've waited for 3 weeks now and no news yet, so have asked  the I Ching whether I should stick with this person and wait.

But he is a wanderer with problems, or at least preoccupations elsewhere and so could not be capable of giving me what I 'need'...Do I affect him as he does me?  (perhaps it's an illusion, I'm projecting a romantic image on to him, mistaking platonic friendship for more)22.2, 5 > 9(I think that says I have little effect, perhaps because he is not attracted to me physically - the external adornments described in Grace... or could it be saying that I am being vain in thinking he does?Is this reawakened feeling one sided?38.2, 4, 6 > 24What do you think?  38 seems to speak of the differences between individuals in a positive way?Inputwould be much appreciate as I'd like to clarify whether my feelings have importance, or whether they are more of my own making and will go away again when I come to a realisation of the reality of the situation, minus the rose tinted glasses Thanks:bows:"
3042,"Through the development of events, a friend of mine got to keep in storage a set of books that my girlfriend got for me, but could not deliver herself because we are separated. The intention was to use him as intermediary but both of us (me and him) feel that it is not the right way to present the gift in the current situation, that things should be done when the situation has settled. After meditating upon loose ends in our relationship and things that i should put in place, i thought that maybe it's a good idea to take the books as it is, say thank you and maybe this won't bug us anymore as another unfinished thing.I asked if it was favorable to pick up the books from him. I Ching replied 56.3 -> 35.Until now i used to look at the second hexagram as the situation and the first as fine tunings, in this case me wanting to Proceed forward, to advance, but this leading probably to an argue with my friend and loosing his trust. I feel a little bit confuse because another friend and experienced diviner said that if i do this, i probably get into trouble with my friend, but in the end i advance so...things aren't that bad.What do you think?"

3046,"Hi, I'm relatively new here with a puzzling situation that I've given up on making sense of myself.Last Sunday morning (Nov. 30) I had a sore throat and possible swollen glands. I have fibromyalgia, and also my tonsils often get irritated without an actual illness being present, so it's sometimes hard for me to tell when I need the doctor. I asked Yi:Q:  Go to the CVS Minute Clinic today, with my sore throat and possible other symptoms? (CVS=drugstore chain)A:   53 unchanging - ""Gradual Progress.""Result:  Not sure...to be safe, I went. Was diagnosed with a virus, which, of course, has to just run its course. Now I understood what Yi meant with 53, but beforehand I thought maybe Yi was saying ""If you go to the Minute Clinic (which was, after all, my question), you will experience Gradual Progress."" (The ""Minute Clinic,"" by the way, was unusually busy according to the nurse and took 3 hours.) [Addendum: It just this second occurred to me maybe that's what Yi was describing with 53 unchanging; however, that's even LESS responsive to my question!]When I got home, I asked the following very exasperated question:Q:  Why not give me 25.5 (""Use no medicine in an illness incurred through no fault of your own. It will pass of itself"")? Even if I didn't understand that advice or follow it properly, there'd be no one to blame but myself and I wouldn't be exasperated with you!A:  57 unchanging (""Penetrating"")Q:  You mean I should have asked you follow-up questions?A:   40.1.2.6 changing to 21 (Solve Problems through Being Tenacious?) Apparently so?Q:   What kind of follow-up questions could I have productively asked you? ""What do you mean by 53 unchanging?"" is the only (not very useful) one I can think of --- ???  [And again, the subtext would be, why not just give me 25.5 in the first place.]A:   39.2.4 changing to 28 (Obstruction - Great Exceeding)Huh? Here's where I'm stuck. Wilhelm-Baynes says:39.2:   The King's servant is beset by obstruction upon obstruction, But it is not his own fault.39.4:   Going leads to obstructions, Coming leads to union.Was Yi purposely trying to ""obstruct"" me from the very beginning? Or, if Yi simply means I've hit a brick wall in trying to understand this situation and I should stop divining about it - okay, but then what about my original puzzlement, which still stands?Thanks in advance for any help!Last edited: Dec 5, 2008"

3049,"Dear all,I received a very frustrating answer from I Ching. The frustration in itself comes from the fact that I have some troubles interpreting it- I don't know if the answer is good or bad.I am in love with this bloke. I met him about one year ago, he used to be my English teacher, I thought we were flirting and decided to make the first move: ask him out. he answered me in most humorous way that I wasn't his ""gender"" (I am straight and he is gay). Since then, we have been very very close friends. Of course I was in love and still am, but tried to hide it for everybody's sake.We moved, me to Amsterdam, him to Paris. the situation of not having him around- such a gentle and constant source of nurture, love and wellbeing- drove me crazy. Eventually I asked the I ching if it was going to be a bad idea to go to Paris. I got 48, unchanging. I thought ""maybe we move apart, but our affection will remain the same"". So, last Friday I went to Paris. It was good, not great, but still good.Problem: I came back and started bombarding him with calls and emails. No good, I know, but I'm not happy in Amsterdam anyway, and it feels so good to live in the fantasy of a perfect relationship. I  asked him if, since I am going to Paris with friends on the weekend before his birthday (which happens to be on a Monday in February), if he wanted me to stay one more day to celebrate his anniversary. He said, with polite words, that I shouldn't stay longer only because of him, that he's going to work anyway and that he's friends in town, so I shouldn't worry because he's not going to spend the night alone.I was negatively surprised by such harsh answer, and I started imaging that probably now he has understood the extent of my love. I feel rejected in a polite way, and fear for the future, for more distance.I inquired the I ching again, this time about what I am supposed to face in the future after being caught my feelings ""on the table"", and I became the same answer: 48, unchanging.What do you think the answer might mean? I am more inclined to think about something like ""he won't love you back"" or ""you won't stop loving him"", but I'm open to your suggestions. Even if there's tough ones to digest!Thanks a lot and lots of blessings fromLili.---"
3050,"Hello Everyone,The man that I love and I can not be together..for now.So we don't see each other since the past year but we talk every week. Yesterday he told me that he has feelings for me that he doesn't want to ""explore"" as long as the situation is the way it is. But of course, I think he explores them by being in constant contact with me without physical contact. It intensifies the emotional connection.I asked the I ching:How does it make him feel when I tell him I love him even though I can't be with him now (at this time in our lives)?I got 62 1.3 leading to 51I then asked:""when he says he has feelings for me, what are those feelings?""I got 49.1 leading to 31 So I know that he loves me. His actions show it (actions speak louder than words). I asked.""Will he ever tell me, ""I am in love with you"" in this life time?and I got 45.4 leading to 8.The I Ching is new to me..some of this reading seems clear but I am not sure how to string it all together into one picture.It would be so great if someone could help me. It looks like he gets upset when I tell him I love him? Or doesn't really believe me? Because 62 1.3 seems that way and 51 is about some kind of upset.49.1 is less clear.the last answer 45.4 leading to 8 was touching. I hope that means what I think it means.thank you kindly "

I can't work out if the 3rd reading about what is going to happen after we split is positive or not?Finally the last reading seems also straight forward.

3062,"Ok so I just HAD to ask I ching ""What do I have to do so I can be happy and find peace""I have got to say I am so excited with what I got!I got hexagram 36 4rth line changing to hexagram 55....I have got to say that I have a thing with Drakness and Light and if you read the explanation of both these hexagrams you can see how these talk about Darkness and the sun in midday! I can see how hex 36 is painting a picture of a situation(?) if you will but I can't see what do I have to do to reach ""fullness"".Or maybe its that I have to reach the bottom and get back up?A litle insight please?Thank you in advance!!!!"
3063,"How helpful might the Yi Jing be in exploring and understanding our universe? Harvard physicist Juan Maldecena is a string theorist who conflated information theory and the mathematical concept of superstrings to bring Stephen Hawking around to accepting that information is more fundamental than energy/matter! Recognizing the primacy of information bolsters the possibility that the Yi could provide deep insight into cosmic questions. The Yi, after all, is an information-generating engine. (And, you will recall, that the 18th century German mathematician Gottfried Leibnitz found confirmation of his binary arithmetic in the Yi Jing; so, there is a venerable tradition in the West of investigating universal values with the Yi.)According to Maldecena's theory, all information is preserved on the boundary surfaces (the event horizons) of black holes ... and that the universe itself is something like a giant black hole. Billions of light years away, at the boundary surface of the expanding universe, string interactions configure reality and project into the volume of the universe the hologram that we take for actuality. In this theory, the world we see around us is a projection -- an illusion! The constituents of reality (of you and me, as well) are billions of light years away, interacting merrily and generating everything around us from the quasars to the monitor on which you’re reading this.This puts added emphasis on the Vedantic notion of sunyata (formlessness) and maya (illusion). And so, I thought I’d put this very strange concept to the Yi and asked, “What merit is there in the holographic theory of the universe?”The reply I received is 6.1.5 transforming to 38 – and I am hoping to better understand this response with help from the community, or at least from those who might share my interest in weird science.Hexagram 38 clearly relates to the strangeness of the concept. I think 6.1 suggests that this idea provokes much contention – and 6.5 that the theory is promising. Is this a legitimate way to interpret these lines?I’m also wondering if there are perhaps better ways to frame such cosmic questions -- or even if posing queries of this magnitude is an appropriate approach to the Yi. Is it hubristic to ask the Yi to vet scientific theories about the ultimate nature of reality?"
3064,"Hello everybody!Long time I'm not coming around... I have been thinking a little anxious these days, like something going on that I can perceive but yet not see. Last time I had this feeling was quite ominous, so I wonder if I am perceiving something that is going on and yet not manifested to me or it is just that I am stressed out because of regular life. The point is that this anxiety comes with a feeling of lack of safety... I asked these questions:""what is causing my anxiety"" and I received 5.6 to 9.""why I am feeling unsafe"" 64.2.4 to 23 (I'm always scared of 23...)""Is there anything I should do about this situation?"" 52.1.6 to 36.Gosh... will you please help me with these readings?Thank you."
3065,"Hi againA while ago I had a pretty heavy emotional experience and later that day when i went to bed just as i was about to fall asleep (my body was asleep but my mind was still a bit here) i saw a Phoenix made of smoke appear. It came into being from smoke strands coming in from below. i am assuming that the dream had connections with the happenings of that day... Now finally I asked Yi about it and it answered with hex 50 ting.There is speak of nourishment, about the wood feeding the fire above, and ""about a man that succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony""So i guess it is talking about something within me, emotionally, that needs to fall into place, and ""feeding"" a certain side of me. finding some sort of equilibrium.What could that thing be...But all this talk about God and fate - Am I missing the symbol here?"
3066,"I remember  3 decades or so ago when I first heard the Beatle's song ""When I'm 64"".  I couldn't imagine actually ever being 64.  Well today was my 64th birthday.  I asked the I Ching the significance of this particular birthday and what the future held in store.  I am amazed often by the I Ching's sense of humor and irony.  I, of course, threw Hex 64,  (changes in the third and fourth lines-changing to Hex 18 ).  Anyone have an idea what it was trying to tell me?"

I have had, for many years, a problem with my ""Center"".  I get this feeling of dread or sadness in my stomach.  This can happen when I'm contemplating something as simple as cooking a dish or going to the store to creating artwork.  When it first began, I would stop what I was doing because I thought it was my ""inner voice"" warning me.  It soon became obvious that it wasn't when it did not warn me of being robbed (twice) and when I sometimes defied it and did what it ""warned"" me not to do with no ill results.  I have tried accepting it, ignoring it, expelling it, loving it, visualizing white light on it , to no avail.  So I asked the iching what is it and what do I do about it and got 17.2.3.4 > 5.  Ok, so I should follow it even though it blocks me from any creative endeavor?  Alos, with 5, I am waiting for an answer, but I don't get the line about blood.  Please help!"

3071,"Hi,I have spoken before about a guy who I can't get my head around.  He's an oddball who I was once interested in romantically, but he was not over his ex and that fell through,but I wanted to remain friends because for me, the connection was special.  He is rather a dark character, but I care for him and it is sad to see that he cannot seem to bring himself believe in the idea of happiness and goodness etc - perhaps I want to knock it into him but not sure that's possible as time is going on, maybe he really doen't care about anything...  I'm in contact with him and we are friends, but I'm sometimes exasperated by things he says - he doesn't seem to be able to let go of the dark, hopeless image he's created I think.. or perhaps he is just sad.Anyway I asked 'How should I consider him in my life?'19.3 Approach > 11 PeaceI also received this answer for someone else I am interested in, who is always friendly etc but I think he has a girlfriend..What do these identical readings say?That I should continue making an effort with both of them, but be mindful of stuffing something up, which could be good?  Or that I shouldn't ruin things by getting the wrong idea ie about romance or commitment?  It's just I see Peace as a nice, romantic type of hex but I think with the changing lines it is saying that there is something wrong, something tripping me up in my dealings with these two.. perhaps it just isn't there for them in that way and never will be..There are some very relevant readings on Lise's site - perhaps I am expecting too much and should just enjoy their company without looking for the love aspect.. for something back.. but it's so hard when the heart and mind wanders and forms romantic probably idealistic dreams best kept in fairy tales...I also asked 'Where am I going wrong in my life?'44.3, 6 Coming to Meet > 47 Oppression.Because though I am on an even keel, self doubt, criticism and an inferiority complex keeps bringing me down and replaying itself in my head like a broken record.  Though I am not depressed outwardly at all, I am constantly questioning myself in every situation.Thanks :bows:Last edited: Nov 26, 2008"
3072,"I am having deep feelings for somebody that doesn't seem to notice me lately.I asked the I Ching how he feels for me, it answered 39.4.5>62Does that mean he is pulling back from me?Then I asked if I ever would receive some loving back from him, It answered 33.5>53That doesn't sound very optimistic in my not so skillfull ears.He doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore? He is saying ""Thanks, but no thanks!""?Maybe it would be best if I just let go, try to get rid of these feelings, and move on.So I asked 'Is it really a lost case?"" It answered 9.1>57Does that mean it would be wise of me to retreat, and let go of how I feel for him?Am I reading it right that it is not going to happen?I would really appreciate some help in interpretating these answers. :bows:"

3077,"greetings friends,i asked recently, as many do, the i ching about the potential of a relationship with ""y"". i first met y during a visit to new orleans two months before hurricane katrina, this was back in '05.  the storm dispersed many of the inhabitants of the city including y.  later that winter i visited her for a week or so.we met up agian in new orleans and we had a brief but wonderful relationship that following spring and summer.  she then moved to ny for grad school and i remained in new orleans. since then we have stayed in contact and have maintained our friendship.after speaking with her tonight i asked these questions of the i ching regarding the relationship:question: what about y and i?  answer: 37 with very many changing lines (1,2,4,5) resulting in 50question: what can i do to bring about a relationship between y and i?answer: 2 with changing lines - 4,5,6 resulting in 12.question: what is the potential for the relationship?answer:  43 with line changing line 5 resulting in 34.it seems to me the i ching is saying i needn't do anything besides being receptive at this time, that there is the strong potential for a relationship and some kind of family with y and that a decision will need to be made in order for this to work out for us?do you think i am interpreting the reading accurately?  i asked one final question as well:what guidance do you have for me regarding y.  and i received 18 changing to 31.over all the i ching seems to be telling me that it is worthwhile and i have homework to do thank you for any advice you may have :bows: ~m"
3078,"Some months ago I did a short-term contract for an independent client.  Although I'm experienced and managed the project, I was relieved when it ended.  In part this was because - in spite of the client being charming and appearing professional on the face of it- I've got my doubts about the 'reality' of her business claims and her personal credibility.I found her project expectations to be unrealistic within the term of the project.  I discussed this with her towards the end of the contract but she disagreed with my viewpoint.The client has contacted me again and wants to discuss a potential adapted contract starting early in 2009.  But based on my 'gut feeling' of not fully trusting nor liking her, I posed a question to Yi:Q. How do the Sages qualify my opinion that I should not work with N?A. 14 ->6, 34I'm thinking that this reading tells me it's worth working with N again - and that we could be a strong team.  But I'm too close to this situation - would any of you like to give me an opinion?Warmest regardsZelda"

I have been dating an interesting woman for some months now.Not a piece of cake i would say, for both of us i suppose, as we are both trying not to get hurt, very cautious , maybe too cautious actually.We've taken our time recently , she needed to sort things out, we sort of cooled down to see what comes ahead.I recently asked the oracle : What role am i currently playing for her?The answer was    8.6>20   It talks about hesitation not being beneficial, but i'm not sure if it says it is over , or just a warning.I also asked :Are we meant to be together? and got 59.3.6>5  This hexagram is a ggod sign on the whole, i think but line 6 just knocks me off.Can you halp me read these answers properly?"

If this should be posted somewhere else please tell me, and I'll try to move it.I was introduced to Yi jing by my mom and it has been around me for many years, but  i haven't been casting it unless I had some big serious questions so my experience in interpreting are limited (specially taking into account my current situation)Only recently have I been ""broadening my horizons"" so to speak. By that I mean seeking out other people who consult it and seeking other translations (then my usual Blofeld translation)Ok here's my problem then.I am just out of a relationship with a girl and this hurts me a lot. We were together for a little over two years out of which we lived together for one. Now I am pretty lost. I am unsure whether to move on, hope for a new beginning, give her time and a thousand others.(more on that later if needed )I use yarrow to cast btw. I have asked several questions and I got my answers. My problem here is that my intuition, in which I've always trusted, is failing me. this is happening because my mind is chattery and hard to focus and I am insecure in my situation so I cannot distinguish between my intuition and what i really really want to happen when interpreting (among a myriad of thoughts racing through my mind..) Also I am not sure if the answers are really to the questions I asked because no matter how much I try to concentrate on the question, in the back of my mind I am wondering ""what to do?""Is there anybody here that could help me to interpret at least some of my answers? I am really stuck here and I dont know where to go "
3085,"Over the past year I have received 27 no changing lines several times when asking about how men feel about me & what I provide for men.  A little background - I have more or less taken a break from dating over this time period, taking time to myself & gaining physical strength & recovering financially after an extended illness.  27 has come up in relation to 5 or 6 men with whom there has been chemistry, but no further action beyond that.  With a couple of the men, 50 no changing lines has come up also.  It seems that 27 can mean nourishing oneself spiritually and physically, which has necessarily been my focus.  Do these men sense that I have the capacity to nurture them (a quality that has developed over the past year, along with more patience & compassion), or do they want to take care of me?  27 can also signify addiction - are these men that have addiction issues?  Some of them have been in existing relationships.  The same gua coming up consistently with quite a disparate group of people has me wondering.Any insight is much appreciated!Last edited: Nov 4, 2008"

I will of course return the favour.I started a training course about 9 months ago and although I enjoy the classes, the teacher is very knowledgeable and we get on well, i have a strong feeling that this is not the right course for me. Not wanting to be hasty and leave the course prematurely,I asked the Yi ""what would it mean to me to change classes at the end of this semister?''The Yi answered with Hexagram 64 changing to 51 the moving lines are 1, 2 and 6  I have some idea of what it means but please would you throw some light on it? your views are much appreciated.Many thanks...Crystalstar"
3089,"Hi,Just a quickie to say that the Yi has been incredibly accurate recently - well maybe it always has been - but it's got me thinking that I'd like to get to the bottom of how it works - I guess CJ Jung would be the man to read up on..  It has also been comforting re my homelife front, which has settled down now - eventhough I'm not completely n'sync with my housemates, I feel that that's ok, it won't be forever and I appreciate them for their difference from me and can still have fun with them and trust them now that the air has been cleared, and it's is not nasty now Anyway, I asked the Yi about a couple of guys I have been slightly interested in recently and for two of them I got readings involving 54 The Marrying maiden.  And, as it turned out I found out that one for definite has a girlfriend, and I have an inkling that the other probably has, because of something said.  Still not 100% though so I asked Has he got a girlfriend?Hex 11 Peace unchangingMy initial reaction to this was Yes, he is at peace and has a steady girlfriend (would you agree??)Then I asked about this other guy, who I have spoken to a lot on the internet (probs too much) and now feel that it can go no further.  Face to face I feel the chemistry isn't there, I'm not sure I'm attracted to him, and I think we're too similar.. for him I received 52.2 Keeping still to 18 Work on What has been spoiled.So accurate!  It says that there is too much expectation, and not the momentum or inclination thus stalemate (we started too fast by getting too deep into conversation on the internet and not enough in real life!)  So I can't see it developing, I could be wrong.  Maybe I'm rejecting him now because he's showing too much interest, or maybe it is simply that I don't fancy him.  I don't know, it always goes like this...So there you go.  The Yi says it all.  And I'm back to square one on the romance front. Ah well.:bows:Last edited: Nov 21, 2008"

The last doctor I went to I trusted, and now the foot is worse. I would like to know the best path of action from here on out as the injury isn't better and time wears on. I have trouble seeing how hex 54 relates to health issues at all, as it is so centered on marriage and relationships. 31 looks hopeful (to take a maiden brings good fortune) although this has nothing to do (again) with relationships. Does anyone have insights on how the relationship lines in hex 54 can relate to health issues?"
3093,I've been dreaming about someone I haven't seen in a really long time. So I wanted to know what these dreams ment and I consulted I ching.

3095,"Talk about synchronicity-- I've just come here to post about 61, and the thread below is also about 61 and by someone with the same name as me. Something is up with this hexagram. Anyway, I'm going through a sort of crisis right now; it's a relationship related crisis (as is often the case here), but it's also a kind of I Ching crisis. Has anyone here ever have the experience of a hexagram radically changing on them? I've been practicing the I Ching for fifteen years on and off, and while I've misinterpreted many times, there becomes a certain familiarity with some hexes and lines. 61 has been the most positive and spiritual for me over the years, always showing up when I've become ""in touch"" in one way or another. It hasn't come up a lot, but when it has, the results have always been deeply positive and far reaching.  But this time has been different. It came up repeatedly (usually unchanging) about a potential new relationship which turned out to be DOA. (I posted about meeting him on another thread: ""Before Completion""; I'd gotten a series of 64s off the bat). To make a long story short, I met a guy on a job, spent an amazing day with him-- nothing physical happened but much attraction, talked about deep personal stuff, he offered help with a business thing. Meanwhile he was out of the country and sent emails. So I was going through this thing because I've finally found my inner peace without a relationship, and I'm cautious about getting hurt again. But he kept showing up in my dreams, and it was always good. And I was using the I Ching a lot (probably too much), but asking more about myself and whether I was ready for a new relationship. But whenever I did break down and ask about the potential relationship, I always got 61 unchanging (3 times). Twice I asked the dreaded ""What are his feelings towards me?"" and got 61 unchanging and then 10.4 > 61. That last one happened after a dream where he and I were standing next to a tiger Anyway, finally met him again today for coffee with the business contact he's so helpfully introduced me to. That was all good, but the business friend asked about his girlfriend and he turned sheepish and left the meeting early. Ouch, this happens every time, it always turns out that there's always another woman involved... And I'm outta here now before things get worse.So I'm pretty sad to realize that I'm still stuck in this pattern (attracted to guys who are unavailable), and I'm also more than confused about 61. I've had plenty of other times when the I Ching had warned me in advance, though I chose not to read the writing on the wall. This time, I was trying to be sober and cautious, though I kept getting positive signs. I just don't understand why. Asked about the 61s and got 37.2.3.4 > 10 (tiger again). Asked about his position in this and got 51 unchanging.  So does anyone have any new insights on 61? I read everything from the archives, but I could still use more. And/or does anyone have a similar experience? Like I said, this has always been such a good hex for me, that it kind of feels like having the rug pulled out from under. Thanks btw to the forum members; I've spent so much time on the archives looking up hexes and lines. Whatever blahs I'm going through now, you've all helped deepen my relationship with the Yi. :bows:MaryLast edited: Nov 20, 2008"
3096,"Hello, i need some help in reading answers i got from the IC concerning a long term friendship which was broken about 3 years ago.It involved a bad row about our daughters(who had also become friends) which made the relationship end with a double big bang.She told me she couldn't see the possibility of a continuation. It was painful at that time , i remember.Although we have seen each other on some occasions in the meantime, nothing has substantially changed the situation.Some days ago i heard from her mother that she's been thinking of inviting us for Christmas this year.I asked IC about her feelings and got hex 50 which seems to indicate a pure heart.I asked what consequences  would  there be if i trusted her again and resumed friendship. I got  1.3.5 >38And again got stuck, couse it seems to say it's gonna be ok, line 5 talks about ""Things that accord in tone vibrate together.Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another""  But line 3 talks about ""temptations"" and not being affected by them and what about the relating hex 38 Opposition? Should it reflect the situation until now, our opposition for those 3 years or a possible unfortunate outcome? Personally i wouldn't say it is the outcome ,rather the background , the status quo of the relationship, cause i couldn't find really negative signs  or evident omens in all those answers.A bit afraid of wishful thinking here again ,though.On the whole i would be very pleased to be able to read it as"" creative opposition"" , but don't know if this wouldn;t be too far fetched. I', too involved to be objective here .So , asked the  IC about the picture of the relationship after her new idea nad got 11.2>36 , and again there's the question if 36 shows really the possible further development (the light will be concealed) or the background or current status ( we have been concealing our light so far).So, i thought ""three times lucky"" and cast a tiebreaking question:What is her position in this situation (towards me)?I got 52.1.5>37Seems to indicate moore explicitly her caution and growing  seriousness in attitude leading to sth more structured between us. Am i right?Any contribution would be warmly welcome."

3098,"Hi,I’ld like to hear  how you see the following readings.Tomorrow I have to give a proposal about a kind of project . I have written something and asked Yi to comment it, something like a second opinion. I got 22.1 > 52 I have some hesitation about how appropriate is for the given situation and choose between what I wanted to write and what would be easy accepted. I choose  to do the first. I see in that line that maybe I’m doing the right thing .I also asked what should I expect from those that will evaluate my proposal and got 35.1 >  21Well, I see that I’ll face some problems and maybe my proposal will not be well accepted but it looks like there will be something worthy if I don’t get discouraged.Is there something I haven't get correct here or do you see something else ?Thanks,Maria"
3099,"Hi all,I asked the i-ching what were my chances of getting the job I applied to and got 18.1>26. I know that 18 means work on what has been spoiled, and there's something in my relationship with the person who runs that place that I can't put my finger on...is that what the hexagram is trying to tell me?Thanks for any help.:bows:"
3100,"My boyfriend and I have had some tension lately, I consulted the oracle asking @How should I now proceed with ...?' I recieved Hex 6 line 3 changing to 44, I took this to mean I should becalm and try to put things right. I called and it seems fine, but I sense tension between us, though he says there is none. I asked 'What role am I currently playing for ...' I recieved Hex 52 line 3 changing to 21.This has upset me a little. Am I correct that this is quite negative? Please help! What do you think Willowfox?many thanks"
3101,"Hi,This reading is about a person I have mentioned before, eg in the thread '28.1, 6 - 1 says what about a person?'.  He is a guy I am drawn to inexplicably, because although I disagree with a lot of what he says, I generally feel that he understands where I'm coming from and vice versa (I see good in him where a lot of people have dismissed him) and I enjoy talking to him - I have spoken to him about things I have told no one else about, though sometimes it's quite deep and I feel like I'm in a different realm a bit when I talk to him.  However I fear all this is one sided, and he claims now to have a heart of stone We are also very different, but share common ground, and I'd like to keep him in my life, but I don't know if that's possible.I asked the I Ching 'What's the story with him?'38.3,4,5,6 Opposition to 5 Waiting This was very telling.  We are very different people, but I'm hoping that could be a good thing, complementary.  The changing lines also seem quite positive - that there is an inner connection, eventhough in many ways we have opposing values, Or is the Yi is generally pointing to how relationships work, especially with opposites, and so IF there is an inner affinity then there's nothing to worry about, he'll come back of his own accord, but it may or may not be the case here...Could line six 'One sees ones companion as a pig covered in dirt' be saying I shouldn't be so mistrustful? 'Those who think well of others tend to think well of themselves, and vice versa.'   Or could it be that we are too different:  'the ever-expanding gulf of difference and communication fading to silence.'  But changing to Waiting perhaps means I just have to let him initiate, then I'll know?  I just don't want to approach him again if, for him, our differences makes him uninterested.I read a very relevant interpretation of the relationship : 'Making real contact with someone who is deeply immersed in a 'Strange' process (him) calls as well for special techniques'.  Perhaps suggesting, again like previous readings, it'll be effort to keep it going (and on my part  but maybe worth it?  I thought I wasn't that bothered about him but I keep thinking about him... and sometimes I'm not sure if I am anything more than another person to tell his woes to, but I just find him stimulating I guess, albeit sometimes in an exasperating way...Finally, if I haven't blabbered on too much, I asked Does he actually care about me?'11.3, 4 Peace - 54 Marrying Maiden.Whenever I see hex 54, I always think it says you are not as imortant to this person as others, but perhaps with the presence of Peace it bodes well?  He just gets me thinking I suppose, someone I can relate to in a different way, but I think perhaps it's not meant to last, as I'm a afraid he may be indifferent.Thanks for reading.  :bows:Last edited: Nov 20, 2008"
3102,"Last night I had another powerful dream and after listening to a dream researcher last week that says we should leave the Freudian interpretations away and look at the emotions of the dream and what our soul is trying to tell us – I thought I would use the IC to help do that.I dreamed that I was in a German concentration camp..a work camp. I didn’t feel in danger of dying but it was a sad place..all the colours were brown and grey. At first I was standing outside (it was rather cold) with a guard. The guard gave me this feeling that he was in love with me. He kept looking at me and then he said, “I hate this war. I wish it would end”. Then he told me, “ok you have to go into work now to clean”. I could tell he was sad to send me off. So I went into a building that was a place with a lot of dirty toilettes. There were only women there, we had to clean by throwing warm sudsy but USED bathwater on the floor and sweep away human excrement with wooden brooms and the water.There was just water everywhere.I didn’t have shoes. Some of the women did, some didn’t. So it made the task quite pathetic to look at. The guard came in to watch me and I could feel his emotions. He was angry that I had to do that work. At this point I knew he loved me and I loved him back.I should add that in the dream I did not feel like I was a Jew..I was in the camp for some other reason but I was a prisoner of the  Nazis.In the dream I never felt in danger or really sad  but I did feel very loved and could observe the emotions of the Guard.Now I haven’t watched any WWII films lately or anything but I do live in Germany and I would like to leave. So the first thing my friend said about  the dream is just an obvious sign that I want to leave Germany.But from my perspective, the dream FELT like a memory.So I asked the IC:What was the dream trying to tell me?And it answered: 26 lines 5 & 6 leading to 5Taming the Power of the GreatSix in the fifth place means:The tusk of a gelded boar.Good fortune.Nine at the top means:One attains the way of heaven. Success.I honestly can’t even begin to interpret this reading! Any ideas?Also, can dreams be memories of past lives? This one FELT like that. Hard to explain why other than the fact that the guard also seemed like someone I know in this life even though he looked different. But I don't want to read too much into it."
3103,"Hello all,This is my first time writing and I have a few questions about how to read the lines.  It seems that in most interpretations one or two lines are focused on.  Do you just focus on the lines that seem to answer your question?  It is hard because some describe totally opposite results. Are the lines read in time progression like 1 is the present and 6 is the future outcome?  Maybe if you help me interpret these hexagrams I can better understand.  I recently learned that the Center I work for is slated to close; this was not a great surprise as our latest Director had been scheming since she got the postition to sabotage our (successful) programs so that she could legitimately get rid of the site (her reasons are unfathonable).  First I asked the Iching what would happen to our site and got 26.  Every line fit except for the sixth, no success.  Next I asked about my feelings of being left behind (there were 4 of us who had worked there for at least 15 years, three are retiring with a bonus which leaves me to bear the burden of losing and wondering where I will be placed next) and I got 27. Last I asked what will happen to me now and I got 48.  I can see lines that make sense such as the muddy well and water leaking as reffering to the work environment but does the clear water mean that the work environment will change for the good?  Please advise."

3106,"Questioned I ching re: new romantic possibilities (not necessarily love, very casual but empowering) after I had met a man on a trip in the fall -(this was after last years much needed break up with my partner,)and me going through lots of changes, the trip sort of capping off or awakening something in me, again not so much love but a powerful strength in my own identity- we just kissed but didn't go all the way- and now I'm sort of kicking myself about that- but there were circumstances- again we only chit chat every couple weeks or so - very casual but he interests meNext Question asked was would I see him again soon?initially I got #1 the Creative which I thought very positive (esp since we were to meet to work creativly as well), but our plans to meet in Dec have fallen through due to sched conflicts and HolidaysI questioned the I ching a 2nd time ""would we re-unite in the spring (since that is the next time I could return)for fun??""I got #51 Shock/Thunder changing to #7 the army- with changing lines 1, 2 & 4 which makes me ask what path to take- should I bother trying to re-unite or just let what was be-  ???? I worry he may not be on the same page due to sched conflicts- or am I just being impatient. should I ask and try set up a reunion in the spring or move onto something new???then I thought lets ask ""what is my best course for sleeping with this dude?"" again no love question here just awesome hotnessI get #9 small restraint with changing lines 1 & 2 to #53 gradual progress- so indeed that is at least clearer. restraint I understand , gradual I get. but how does one hold back the thunder in one's pants???"
3107,"Good evening. This will be a bit complex so bear with me. I asked the Yi 2 questions pertaining to the same person. The second question below is one I asked today; the other was recently.___How does this man see me? 31.5 >62.What could this mean mean TO ME? 37.1.5>52.That's the Q/A. Now my analysis.___31.5 -- Wooing. ""Thus the universal mutual attractioin between the sexes is represented. In courtship, the masculine principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine principle."" Generally speaking he sees me as attractive. So far so good. HOWEVER. Line 5, being a changing line, overrides the generality of that statement. But I can't make sense of the line in this context.Line 5 : The influence shows itself in the back of the neck. No remorse.Influencing one's neck. [Lifting one's head and stretching the neck implies purpose and preparedness.]"" ...  (he sees me as purposeful and prepared?) Hex 62: weakness, excess Yin. Tread carefully, allow feelings full expression, but don’t pour resources into the grave.62 ..""is about 'passing, going by, exceeding'. The central idea is crossing a line - whether that's a standard of morality or of customs, or a border in time (such as the change of the year)... tends to describe transitions: complete this crossing, go beyond what's familiar or expected, and you'll find yourself in a whole new landscape.""You can't make the transition called for in Hexagram 62 on the basis of your personal strength and power to bring about change; you have to do it as a small person, one who responds and adapts to a bigger reality even as she travels.""In sum, would this mean he finds me attractive but is afraid to approach?___Second reading: What could he mean for me? 37.1.5. and 52.I have to say as a longterm (now) single female, I saw this hex and saw exclamation marks in front of my eyes (!!!). Family? Is that right?The Judgement -  The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers. (this is not good. I'm not the pursuant female type...or rather, I dont want to be. Its way too easy to be, and I think it upsets the natural order of things).Line 1: Being restrained to one's own house/safety/seclusion. And ""A noble man has substance through words and perseverance through actions: can also be translated as: his words have substance and his actions have perseverance.""Line 5: There need be no anxiety; there will be good fortune.A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind. He does nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family can trust him, because love governs their intercourse. His character of itself exercises the right influence.They associate with one another in love.Hex 52: Thus the superior man Does not permit his thoughts To go beyond his situation.Therefore, he could be my future husband, but it is not my place to even let my mind GO THERE.___If the second reading is more or less accurate, I dont get why the Yi would give you an image of family and then say ""dont think about it."" Ideas?"
3108,"Hello,My last post on the subject of my living situation was definite - I was going to look for somewhere else and leave the damaging influence of my current housemates.   But now once again my head is floating in the middle and I don't know what the right way is, what is good and true in the situation. Diamanda and Willowfox - you have represented the opposing voices in my head which are back again.Basically things came to a head tonight.  I told my housemate for definite that I was looking for somewhere else (giving a practical rather than personal reason) and went for a house viewing (the place wasn't suitable).When I returned home, they had all been drinking, and were asking me why etc etc.  One was being quite pushy about something which pushed me over the edge and on came the water-works - full force.  Something I really didn't want to happen as once I start they can keep coming.... so it all came out.  All the hurt I have been feeling over the past weeks (and discussed in detail here) came out and yes, I pointed fingers.But they said they were completely unawares, that the face pulling meant nothing.  They said they thought I hadn't been making enough effort to go out etc but that they wanted to live with me and counted me as a friend etc..  I admitted that I had been keeping to myself recently which hasn't helped any sort of bonding, but that was because I felt they didn't want me around and that I didn't belong to, what I have come to see, as an already formed group, since they treated me badly (at least that's how I perceived things when they ignored me and pulled faces behind my back and generally put me down etc.. though maybe that was All jest and I just don't operate like they do...)Anyway, they were mainly comforting me etc, and I felt bad for bringing down their night as they were going out.  So I went to my room.  Perhaps I wasn't willing to accept their assurances but one guy, who is well meaning but not good when drunk, shouted (so I could hear) thanks for ruining the night!  So I came out siting that as an example of their nastiness, then another got angry that I'd brought in a dark cloud.  Believe me I did not want it to happen this way... anyway it ended up with one of them saying that tomorrow, when sober we will talk about the whole thing and sort it out.... they seemed to want to salvage the situation and make it better and re-assure me (which I feel bad about making them feel they need to do...)Now, from their words I should trust them.  But I feel like they've twisted everything, made it out to be my fault for not going out etc (though we haven't been here long and I have been working anti-social hours! - and should I really have to keep proving myself a worthy housemate/ friend by going where they want all the time?? and they didn't admit to doing anything wrong..  perhaps in their minds they didn't. I'll admit that I haven't made it easy for them, perhaps my over-sensitivity has meant I now shut off their perhaps genuine advances.  I mean,  I was shocked that it happened, because I really thought they'd be relieved to hear I was going but they seemed to take it as a personal attack or rejection..  Perhaps I have been intolerant and underestimated their regard for me.. everyone's different.  I feel very confused.  What I believed about them keeps going in and out the window.  I asked the Yi, (once I'd calmed down)  After this showdown what do I do? Can it recover?I received 39 Obstruction unchanging.I think, it appears to be saying, that I should re-unite with them (though are they the 'friends of like mind'? (perhaps they could be on some level.. but after all this?) and also, admit that some of the blame of what's happened lies within me and my insecurities - perhaps it was a sel'f-fulfilling prophecy as I was worried about this from the word go.. but then I can't imagine this happening with people I am close to...But I also am afraid that perhaps they are twisting it, to make themselves look good and feel better? Because I know how I felt, and that they were being bitchy, it seemed to me... but perhaps it is misunderstanding?  I know they are well meaning overall - but I'm sure what happened counts as bullying, though of course they won't admit it.  And Diamanda, I must bear in mind your advice on knowing when to walk away from hurtful people... but maybe they really do care and I ballooned it into a personal attack when it was just play.... So confused, and wondering if the relations can recover, again, perhaps this has cleared the air?  But leopards don't change their spots, and perhaps it's a simple case of incompatibility?  And perhaps I have now made it me against them?ThanksLast edited: Nov 14, 2008"

3115,"I have pursued a freelance writing career for the past 6 yrs. My ""office jobs"" are taken purely to support me in a manner flexible enough to pursue this career. The writing is very important to me; ""career"" is not even the right word, it is more of an artistic pursuit and passion.However, in order to write about the topic I specialize in, I relocated to another country 5 yrs ago. The living conditions here are very poor (3rd world). I live like a church mouse, there is often no hot water (or no water at all) and so forth.This past year has been especially trying condition-wise and I decided (or thought I had) to return to the USA. However, the changes mentioned in the other thread are making the arrangement I had set up --which is a way to combine a higher salary that would afford me better living conditions, with the flexible schedule that allows me to continue to pursue the writing -- has now fallen to pieces. In short, I do not know what to do, I dont know what will happen, and I'm not sure how to structure a life that is manageable. To date I have had to choose: live in the USA on a nice comfortable lifestyle and no writing (bc the topic i cover doesnt exist there) OR, live poorly in another country but have my writing. I desperately want to combine both, somehow.I thought if i just found another company willing to pay me more, I could take frequent trips to this other country; the other ideal setup is to find another local co to pay me more.

3116,"I posted what was for me a long standing question a few weeks ago and the feedback was very helpful. So I have one more big question in my life right now.  A little background: I was a grad student instructor and after the semester a student seemed to show interest and I was so I contacted her to see about meeting. We emailed a bit and had a meeting for coffee on campus set up. (She had since went on to grad school at a nearby campus) The entire situation had me way off my equilibrium and I canceled the meeting since I was in the midst of a hectic semester where I needed to do well and I was afraid of emotional turmoil being fairly new to dating and such strong feelings. I was also leery because she had just got out of a 'very intense and long' relationship and didnt want to be a rebound. So contact stopped for @ 6 months until earlier this year. I was graduating and leaving for Buenos Aires for the summer so I thought I should finally pursue things. We met for coffee and had dinner. We emailed afterward but never made it out again before I left. She invited me out with her friends after but I balked/chickened out. However I finally asked where things stood and she seemingly, or actually, ended it by saying that she didnt sense any chemistry between us. That killed but subsequent emails were much more honest and with definite exchange of affection. Midsummer I replied to her last email and sent some pictures. I got no response so I figured OK fine its all over. But a few weeks ago since Im back in the country, and for the most part over it, she contacts me again. So over email I find out shes now in a relationship but seems to have questions about it. Our bouts of long emails seem to be over for this round and things are at a standstill. So I asked:What is the outcome if I release hope for a relationship with X?  43.4 to 5Is X interested in pursuing contact towards a relationship?  43.0  UnchangingWhy did she contact me at all?  34.3.5.6 to 10What is her position? 17.2.4 to 60What is my position? 28.0  UnchangingMy situation feels too unstable to try to 'steal her away' right now but Im just wondering if thats a possibility. If not and shes just seeking a sort of friendship fine at least it would ease my mind. I should also add that there have been a few synchronicities surrounding the situation that keep me thinking I should pursue her. But apologies for the long post. Some help interpreting the reading would sincerely be appreciated. Thanks all"

3123,"I asked 'what does g-d have in store for me regarding a relationship?' I ask this from a truly humble place. I hope for the experience of a committed  partnership if g-d sees this is right for me. I say it this way because I believe relationships are a spiritual journey and they are an opportunity for our greatest spiritual growth. Men have come into my life and it seems I either like them more than they like me, or they are not capable or desiring of intimacy, and not many men have actually noticed me at all in my life. I believe I have a solid and loving relationship with myself and I believe I see myself, but perhaps I am lying to myself because otherwise wouldn't this love be reflected in my experience in the outer world? I asked yi what g-d has in store for me and got 58 unchanging. That sounds lovely. So when? Thank you for your insight on this and please when you think of me, send me wishes for a loving partnership and companion. Thank you."
3124,"Hi ya'll,OK--after receiving 23.6 many times in recent months, I've decided to write this group and see if you can lend some insight.  I find it such an interesting line that for me brings with it some sort of reassurance and even a bit of relief, but just after those initial feelings I inevitably find myself perplexed, and perhaps stuck in a kind of polarized interperative dilemma.  I cannot seem to decide if the message is about ""unexplored options "" or more about one being rather progressed in the process of 23--which seems to hint at better times ahead.  And another question comes up here that has to do with the whole ""house of the inferior man"" being split apart.  I appreciate Wilhelm's (and others) commentary on this line and I actually find it illustrtative of what some might call natural or even universal laws, but it also seems to bring in even another dimension to the line.  You know, the idea that as one strips away what is old, and no longer relevant, those structures, will..what?  Lose their steam, deteriorate, implode?  because they no longer being energized by ""superior man.""  So it seems there are three different, though not necessarily unrelated possible messages within the line.  I would say that when receiving it I have usually been asking questions about challenges that I've been experiencing for quite some time.  Maybe asking something like, ""what is going to help me with this?""  ""or what is going on here?""  So you can see how I would wonder if the Yi is saying, there is something approach or outlook or attitude that you haven't tried that could help--or if it is saying keep on with this process of 23 that you're in and things will work out...or...How do folks see this and do you have experiences with the line that you would be willing to share?  Thanks and Peace,Maya"
3125,"Dear friends,The Dr. has recently discovered that my son (25) has a health problem. He has 3 cysts in the thyroid gland.I´m really worry! My question was...""What kind of cysts are these?""The answer was...54 with no moving lines!I know I´m just a simple beginner but when I read the Hexagram I didn´t like what I felt. Thanks in advance for your time and answers!...I need your interpretation about this Hexagram, please!"
3126,"Last week I was very grateful for the insights I was given here for a reading. May I ask for your help again please? The last week has been very traumatic for me and I am pretty sure that I am getting a very clear signal that the work I am doing must come to an end - which is what I posted about before. Now today I have had two more very hard knocks, and one was extremely personal and hurtful. I am self employed and really cannot cope on any level with what is happening. So I asked 'What if I call it a day and take down the website?'The answer was 58 1,2,4,5  => 2On face value, it seems a very positive thing to do, from the first two changing lines, but the second two changing lines seem to contradict this. Am I being cautioned about doing something that feels good but actually isn't so wise? Or being asked to just stop and think a bit?Hex 2 seems to me in this context to represent ground cleared ready for growth.I am, once again, very grateful for your insights. This is a very big issue for me and I so appreciate your help.Thank you"

3128,"Hello all,My question was work related. I think (i Know) that I'm at a turning point in my professional life and I have to make decisions. I asked the IC about a job offer (I've been contacted for an interview): what will be the outcome if I hope getting that job?  I received 63.6>37. I was wondering if hex.63.6 was saying: don't look back at what is done. And line 6: don't take things for granted (LiSe's book of the moon): I should assume that because they contacted me and I fit the profile, I'll get that job for sure.So the resulting hex. 37: if I don't take things for granted I'll grow? Or...? I'm lost.I read a few threads about Hex.63 and Hex.64. But I'm still confused with the resulting hex. I totally agree with some forum members: it is the end of a cycle... I'm now wondering if hex.37 is auspicious ?Thank you for your insights,Mousse"
3129,"Hi,Some of you may remember from posts very far back, actually when I first joined this forum, about whether I should live with a group of people that I wasn't sure of - wasn't sure they were real friends - perhaps I'd just imposed myself on them and they couldn't care if I was there or not... My most recent post on the matter was 'A Mistake? '.Well things have gone from bad but bearable to worse, and now I feel my only option is to move out, either return home and lose my current job and not see people I am close to here (outside the house) and miss out on potential new friendships, which would be a shame, or I could move in with strangers in this same town.  Both options will be an upheaval physically, financially and socially, but I can't bear it.  I can't stay somewhere where I feel stifled, unable to communicate, put down, resisted and talked about behind my back.  I am too old for bullying and life is too short.  I also know that there are good nice people out there whom I can have fun with and maybe I should take a chance, because there is no common ground here and they clearly resent me and don't want me around.Basically this evening was awful as I caught one of them laughing as the other pulled a face behind my back because I said I was too tired to go out, as I work early mornings, but I don't think they realised I'd caught it.  So then, in shock though I had been sensing they were bitching about me for a few days but I guess was in denial, I decided, right the **** has hit the fan so to speak, but I will try and salvage any connection I may have with these people, so I went along to the pub where I felt blatantly like I was being mocked attacked and shunned, so I left.I am now decided that I have to leave because it can only deteriorate.  I don't have anything in common with them and they obviously dislike my presence here.  But I don't know whether to go home, where there is nothing for me really as it is a small town without friends, or stay here and keep the job I have, though the expense of finding somewhere else, and replacing my room, and then the chance of seeing these ex housemates in the future is high which will be hard, but I guess I could be strong enough to turn the other cheek and hopefully make new friends again here... or maybe I should return home and sit back, but as I said, I'd lose a good job and probably be more likely to dwell and become even more unhappy.So I asked What should I do???35.1,2, 5 Progress  > 10 TreadingPlease, I would very much appreciate general words of advice here - I feel that this is the biggest mess and upset I have caused myself by not listening to my instincts.Last edited: Oct 29, 2008"

Let me be clear about that.But that doesn't mean that I could ask help in the insight in the IC outcome of my questions. The final dissicion is up to me anyway.My doggy got diagnosed of a failing liver function.As she is too old to take a part of here liver for examining we will not be sure what the cause of this liver disfunctions is.So the veterinair told me she would describe medication which might help or which might not help.As a liver is a very important organ it's about sure that she will die finally of this liver failing, but as the way is often concerning life and death, nobody will know when.While being someone that tries to take as little medication as possible and only will take them if really really necessary, as my dog depends on what I decide, in big lines the same goes for her.I ask the questions because one could, often out of fear of loosing a very very good compagnion, decide to try the medication. At the other hand medication could make her even more sick and than die..I ask the IC two questions.1. What will the taking of medication do for my dogs health: 64.2 > 352. what will the -not- taking of medication do for my dogs health: 58.4 > 60Seeing the outcome of the questions I would say I would try medication for her."

I'm in one of those phases where I'm getting too obsessive in my questioning, and starting to lose clarity. Can anyone help?

Without going no returning. In hard conditions determination: no fault. Do not worry over a truth. (Even) an eclipse brings blessing.

Living moment after moment makes that possible. Restrictions need expiring dates, so every new cycle will have its own new energy. Life becomes a composition. Not the notes but their rhythm and succession make the music. Play your own song on your own flute.

3144,"Hi all,I have a question about a reading I got.

I have no plans to move or anything, as i'm fine up here but it gets lonely from time to time.So I asked how my future here would develop.

It talks of  'penalties' and 'lawsuits' but I have no need of these in my work at all, except that I do feel very responsible for my situation and even ashamed of where I am with everything (although factors like long term ill health have contributed).Then there's line 3 - burning down a lodging house and losing servants. I do certainly feel very alone and have a real sense of wanting to leave behind what I have been doing up to now. Sort of I want to burn my boats and move on. But Sarah Dening interprets this as saying do not interfere with what is not your business and guard against being quick tempered or arrogant. I'm not sure how that equates to the various translations I have consulted (Willhelm and Brian Browne Walker).35 does feel a little better though.Am I being told to be kinder to myself or am I missing the point completely?

It just makes work that much harder. No blame."" Ie. It's not easy to approach him but possible?? If you should want to??line 5: The hearts of the people are won, not by force and repression, but by benevolence and philanthropy. But when the benevolent man is too readily accessible, he may well be treated with insolence; and insolence can only be kept in check by careful maintenance of dignity at all times.and 44 as the female principal advancing of its own accord to meet the male.

But 25.5 (fan yao)  speaks a lot to everything I know about being ""co-ey"": ""Use no medicine in an illnessIncurred through no fault of your own. It will pass of itself.""Is the Yi counseling me, as many addiction programs do, to not attempt to intervene, but let the addiction run its nasty course so my loved one will eventually see that she needs help on her own?

3159,"I haven't been doing I Ching for very long so I am here to see others instincts about my readings.I have questions about a person that I love but there are many complications keeping us apart.  We are not together now.  I asked if this person was bad for me.  I received 29 unchanging which seems to say that it he is, but Wilhelm's translation speaks of water staying true to its essential nature and says that K'an represents the heart. I am confused about this aspect of the hexagram. I am very interested in this hexagram because it deals with emotion and the heart.So I tried to get more clarity by asking the reverse of the question: is he good for me to be in a relationship with?  I got 56.1.2.3.6 to 54.  I'm a little unsure about this one because I'm not sure whether the first hexagram means I have to physically go to him or if it indicates an attitude I need to approach him with of humility, integrity and an open heart. Also the moving lines 2 and 3 seem to contradict each other.  Then it leads to the marrying maiden which seems very negative as well.  This hexagram seems to say that every possible movement available in this situation is unfavorable or that some good only comes if you wait or if you are submissive and docile.  My general impression from this hexagram is that your fortune lies in how well you can adapt to others, of being in an inferior position and finding harmony in knowing your place below others.  The description of this hexagram is so confusing because it is very outdated and I am finding it hard to relate to it.  I have been thinking about the possible variations on this one and have come up with several possibilities. Maybe it represents a situation where one person is overly-dependent on the other and sees them as an authority in their partnership instead of an equal.  Another is that the elder sister represents another person in the man's past (man in my case) who he is still in love with and that he doesn't love the younger sister as much, hence the superior and inferior positions, or maybe it is that the younger sister is inferior because she is never going to reach a level of deep love and intimacy for this person no matter how long they are together, that they do not belong together because there is someone else out there who he will love far more and when he meets her he will leave the younger sister for her.  I am also very interested to know the depths of meaning of this hexagram since it is so hard to relate to and because I seem to get it a lot.  Wilhelm seems to view this hexagram as unfortunate in general while others seem to say to simply wait before making a decision or taking any action.Finally moving on, I asked if I was supposed to have this person, which now that I think about it is kind of a stupid question and that is why I got the answer I did.  58.5 to 54.  The last question I asked was what direction should I take in my relationship with him now?  I got 21.1 to 35. I guess this means I should stay away from the path that leads to him so that natural progress will take me from this confusion and weak position to one that is bright and beneficial?  It seems that I should act quickly and precisely but the marrying maiden suggests waiting to act.This might all be so obvious that I think that there must be more to my readings.  Thanks for all insight."
3160,I inquired about a project I've been working on for some time. Have come to a point of transition in the work and have reflected on how it's been going along and seen new aspects about it that were hidden from me before. This is mostly about the core reading but I added the others as they were also answers pertaining to the situation. How should I proceed from here in this regard to the project?33.4 -> 20Seems to advise ... no longer engaging. Perhaps pull back to get a clear picture?I then asked:Should I continue with the project as usual?Answer:--- ------ - ---- ---- - ------ ------ ---10.3.5 -> 14 10 speaks of making differentiations etc. That has been involved in the project indeed. Also at this point a new light has come to me and seems to put things in a different perspective. Line 3: Seems to speak to me on how I was going on with this before hand. Unable to see with both eyes and just throwing myself into the work with great self sacrifice - for a higher cause. But I couldn't see that then. Now however I can see better. But I'm at a transition point. My question is to go on as it has been seems to be reflected in this line as a misfortune. As it would be only good to do so if unable to see clearly. Now that I do. Line 5: Seems to counsel a resolve to go on. To persevere but now with the new awareness that was before hidden. Then to narrow this down I asked:Why continue with the project now? 50.2.3 -> 35So it seems to be advising. Both: changing directions and continuing.Am I correct? Thx in advance.
3161,"Willowfox.Just wanted to thank you for repleying to my questions... I felt that it was only fair to give you an update on your answers.51 -36Question was : will X contact me over the next month.You said something happened to him... he is in a confining situation. and no he will not over the next month ( its been excatly a month today since I heard  from him )You were so right !!!! Alot of things came crashing down on him.... a death in the family, finances...ect... they happened all at once..  He excaped to a cave.  He said he was depressed and was'nt talking to anyone... He is better now.Then I asked about trying to call him...24.4  to 51You said yes.. I might get lucky.Acually I ended up sending him an email.. telling him my confusion , and how it was affecting me... I was very nice , but firm in my feelings .[]He called to day[/B].... and we talked for over an hour.... soooooooo you were right.. I did get lucky.  Willowfox... being of my nature... I would of never of tried again... But your answer gave me the courage to do it...  Thank youI asked one more questionWhat can I expect from X now64.6 to 40Is this saying.. to keep my head... not out of the water yet ?Thank you"
3162,"Hi Everyone,I wonder if you could help me with a reading that can’t grasp . The question was “Yi, help me to understand what is going on between me and X.”And I got 27.2.6> 19Line 2 I think it talks about seeking or taking nourishment from an inappropriate source and line 6 that being a source of nourishment you better watch out what and how much you give. And maybe hex 19 says that I should oversee the whole situation and especially the nourishing part.How would you interpret  this reading?  Line  2 is the one I really don’t get that clear. And looking at its fan yao 41.2 :”To set things right: pitfall” it makes me more confused. Thanks,Maria"
3163,"Hello Forum!I hope you can help me with this dilemma I have... I am going through a moment of changes in my life. I think I have never been as ""whole"" as I am currently. Even in my personal relationships, I am entering into a new stage, something I always yearned... When I ask the Yi about my current situation, the state of my relationships, I receive very fortunate readings. And deep in my heart I know that all is well. There is a sensation in the background that doesn't let me enjoy these moments of change and novelty. So, I made two questions hoping that I can see what is happening clearly and start enjoying what it is... I asked:What is stopping me for enjoying the present circumstances, specially in what refers to relationships? 58.2.3.4.6 to 37.  Well, I think this is a very appropriate answer to my question... but I would love your comments on this. I feel there is a good advice here and wouldn't like to miss its fullness. Thank you so much!Sam"
3164,"Since my last thread: http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=6640I've figured a lot out. My partner returned from business, managed to find out about my infatuation (she knows me like the back of her hand), we had a major crisis and solidly recommitted to each other. I am genuinely happy, and feel horrified at having hurt her, which is why I also feel greedy and slightly crazy for continuing to harbor strong feelings for this other woman. My partner has encouraged me to continue a friendship with said ""other woman"", although I can tell she is still scared deep down that it's a threat to our relationship. She wants me to be happy, and she knows I would be sad to lose the friendship of this person. Meanwhile, I don't know what to think or feel. I genuinely miss spending time with this woman, and also want to start over and build a good friendship with her, no more flirting, no more games. But I saw her last night for the first time since the crisis with my partner, and wham. I can tell that we both have strong feelings for each other, and some part of me just can't seem to let go of this fantasy, as much as I've resolved to stay with my partner and be happy with her. Feeling confused after this new flood of feelings, I asked the Yi the following:--""Seeing B. really threw me, because I can tell we really feel for each other but there's nothing to 'do' with this, given the circumstances. What should I keep in mind?"" >>Got 32.6 to 50 --Part of me still feels like I'm in love with this person, and I really get the sense now that the feeling is mutual. I know I need to let go of this, but some part of me will always wonder what could have been between us, in different circumstances >> Got 22 (Grace,) changing lines 4 and 6 to 55, Abundance. Thanks so much for any insight into this. I've never been in a situation like this and feel completely thrown. I think I may be in love with two people..."
3165,"I have never read anything about past tense readings but I did one and it blew my mind. Is not the past on the same continuum as the future?  It seems to me that the Yi has a lot to teach me about my past.  Most people would assume that they know their past already so why bother?  True, and maybe not so true.  If you understand why everything has happened to you then you need to look no further, I suppose.Does anybody else here every do a reading for the past?  Frankly, I don't see how the Yi could have come up with the hexagram and changing lines that it did unless it was pretty smart about it.  I mean, it was so smart that I would defy somebody to tell me that it wasn't 100% accurate to a level that cannot be faked or mere chance.  You cannot fake a reading about a gunshot wound, right?"
3166,"Hello Forum, I would like to ask you about your thoughts on this reading. Hex. 11 to 28 is an interesting picture and I am trying to see how 11 and 28 relate to each other through these lines. I got this reading when asking ""what is the real situation between us (objectively)"". I asked the Yi to let me know this so I could ponder about the situation. I appreciate your comments.  :bows: Thank you!Sam"
3167,"Hello again,One more question for this week...   I asked ""what do I need to do for the success of my business"" and received 14.3.5 >10. After following previous advice, it seems that things have improved now. Still, hexagram 10 makes me think about being cautious while stepping on. I see that line 3 is asking for modesty in our giving, and line 5 talks about having the correct attitude for harvest. Might it be that I am on the right track for the success of my business?  What is your view on the advice I am receiving? Thank you,Sam"
3168,"Hey there!This is my first post... I finally joined! I am studying the I Ching but too new to understand completely what I receive. I hope you can help me on this question. Does he have a romantic interest in me? 14.3.4 to 41The background is that this guy and I are getting closer, we have something going on but I just don't know if it is a ""warm"" friendship or if, indeed, there is something beyond this cozzyness I experiment when we are together. My other question:What's the best I can do for the best of our relationship? 30.4, to 22. Is it telling me that I should try to avoid to be too superficial on what is happening between us?and one more: What is my place in his heart? 53.1.4.5.6 to 55. I hope you can help me on this. Sorry for making so many questions. "
3169,"Hello all,I asked the I Ching for advice on a situation with someone, as I am feeling quite discourage... I received 5.2.6 moving to 36.Could you please tell me what this reading is saying?Thanks!"
3170,I asked a question some time ago about something happening to me. Found the answer quite perplexing. The thing happening is irrelevant as I'd just like to understand the changes and the hexagrams. Why is this X happening ?Hex 11.1.3.5 -> 29Hexagram 11 seems pretty good but 29 looks pretty bad... So what can this mean? I find it interesting how amazingly contradictory the I ching can seem. Forgive me for being vague but I'd rather not discuss the event but simply the oracular change itself. I guess I'm fishing for some anecdote. It may be a line of advice. Practice is the only good thing I see in hexagram 29. For most of the negative aspect is toil and turmoil. But if Peace is the first hexagram turmoil cannot be a related hexagram. Line 3 speaks of the immortality of evil (right?) which is the only negative thing I see in this reading of 11. Some interpret it as saying don't complain just enjoy. But if hexagram 29 is the result I'm not sure i'd enjoy that. So what can this reading be advising or describing?
3171,"The company I am working for is closing, so I am looking for another job.I applied 2 days ago to a job in an advertising agency. My question was:Will I get this job?The answer: 42.1.5.6 > 242. INCREASE. It furthers oneTo undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water. 42.1 It furthers one to accomplish great deeds. Supreme good fortune. No blame. 42.5If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not. Supreme good fortune. Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue. 42.6He brings increase to no one. Indeed, someone even strikes him. He does not keep his heart constantly steady. Misfortune. I see this as I might get the job, but it won't be easy (maybe also because advertising, in my country, is a very excluvist and competitive environment, they don't accept easily outsiders like me).I don't understand the meaning of the relating hexagram, 2, receptive. Is it good, in this context? (It sounds like this to me.)Thank you."
3172,"Hi, I'm new here and to the Yi but I've been getting weird feelings when I do my readings.  Frankly, I get stunned by them. They seem to be so accurate that they are a bit scary.  Like, ""Yipes!""  I would appreciate any comments on this one though.Q. What do you think the results would be of a trip to Belize in the period January through March?A. Chun - hex #3  ""Difficulty"" or ""Difficulty at beginning""Lines 1,4,5 changed resulting in Yu - hex #16, ""Repose""At first I took this to be a ""don't cross the ocean"" answer. I was ready to cancel. The next day my application (at work, needing approval from several managers) got hung up at corporate level and for some reason this triggered my interest to take another look.  I then found and began to appreciate the ""at the beginning"" part of the difficulty theme. Suddenly I got that tingling lightning bolt of recognition that this hexagram was describing my application hangup at the corporate level in the infancy of the trip process.   It's not the trip itself, but the trip process. Could this really be the ""beginning"" of the trip?  It began to look like it.  Reality check requested there.There is also the ""consolidation"" theme to Chun (no new goals).  At first I did not think a trip could be consolidation because it's a deviation from the normal work life.  When I looked further into it I realized that this is actually my third such trip, and that the reason for all of the trips is the same.  I began to sense that instead of being something ""new"" I was actually just trying to execute a Phase III of my overall plan.  I would call that consolidation, but I need a reality check on that too.Not to get too personal or esoteric, but this consolidation theme is very important to me because I had planned to deviate on this trip, and perhaps buy some property.  Now that would clearly be a new project.  I was once again stunned that I was being given counsel not to buy that property, and I have taken that part very seriously. I think that by staying in these perceived bounds of consolidation (just trying to get to know the country) and by not being turned back by bureaucratic delays in the beginning, I should be good to go.Yu #16 doesn't seem to be especially relevant, but my understanding is that the line readings and the first hexagram are primary anyway.  Maybe I'm not appreciating the role of Repose in this case, but it does appear to be at least mildly supportive.Thank you for your patience. Any comments or advice would be appreciated. Paul"

3174,"Hi everyone, I am still new to the I Ching and regarding relationship readings i tend to get confused.In my last post, I had asked about a guy I had been seeing but then got in a fight with and we broke off contact. I had asked in that reading what his feelings were towards me and received hexagram 54. Which was explained to me meant he possibly wanted to be in control I still have feelings for him and did another reading asking if the obtacles or issues between us can be overcome. The result was 62 with moving line 3 changing to 16.I am confused because the overall message of 62 and 16 seems to be promising but line 3 seems to suggest otherwise.any insights?"

It seems shocking, what does it imply? i asked if he will finish it, he is doing pretty good.the imagery, shows prison walls, no prospect of escape, taking 3 years to the task. What does it mean at all? Could it mean he will finish it in 3 years, which is the stipulated length of time, or mean something else? It sounds like slave work.insights appreciated."

Was pretty friendly for a while haven't heard from her in a long time. I was over enthusiastic about wooing her - she was somewhat enthusiastic about me sometimes... but then ever hiding in shadows.

(note that affair here is vague, but the impression that is given would be romantic - hope the iching picked up on it).21.5, shows the person biting on lean meat, receiving yellow gold. But, danger is present. does i mean that the ""bait"" is taken, since the lean meat is bitten; or does it mean that the person is going he right path, as in being honorable throughout? the wilhelm interpretations give both as an answer and it is confusing. ""avoiding making mistakes"", true as ""gold, impartial as yellow"".Incidentally, 25 means ""innocence"", does it mean innocence ,literally, or ""degenerate nature""? the interpetations seem deceiving in his regard.

But well,... maybe it's really happening!Anyway, I hope I could jump of happiness but instead I feel quite down to earth - perhaps because the last time someone told me I love you I did jump very high and then crashed to the pavement soundly and painfully. I made two questions to the I Ching about him, and it surprised me that in both occasions I received the same lower trigram with the same lines changing (is this of specific significance?) and both times I receive the same changing hexagram. 1.

3185,"Greetings all!    My relationship with my partner, that started back in July, is deepening, there have been some teething problems with our respective ex-spouses but they were to be expected and are nothing we can't handle given enough consideration. Our children all get on well too. My partner went through a bitter divorce that was a great financial drain, allowing his ex to keep the old family home, so his kids would have that security. As a result he lives in the apartment above his mother. She has always been very nice to me, welcoming me and my daughter, inviting us to family lunches etc. But she can be an odd one. Sometimes I am very comfortable with her, at other times there is a definite vibe that really baffles me. This is not an easy one to broach and I am begining to suspect she has a much stronger influence than I at first realised. I believe she even influences his attitude to our relationship and how much time we spend together. I am a mother and understand how she loves him, but the mother of a daughter, it's a different kind of bond. Obviously, I care deeply and want our relationship to work, so establishing a good friendship with her is important. I asked the Yi ' what role do I now play for his mum?' I received hex 20 lines 2\5\6 changing to hex 7 then I asked ' how should I proceed with her?' I received hex 4 lines 2\4 changing to 35. I see these as being positive but not without some problems to come? She is still making her mind up maybe? And I have to be careful? She sees me as a little ignorant? But she will come to like and accept me? Please help with this. Many thanks"
3186,"Hi there,I hope you can help me tu inderstand this that is happening to me. I am have the possibility to do something new which, deep inside I feel that is the right thing to do. I actually started preparing myself, but every time that I need to move forward, I get paralyzed -I cannot move back or forth. I feel very anxious about it and suspend everything -which brings me some peace. If I feel to forget about this new thing, I feel that I will miss something good, but if I think of going ahead, I have the same reaction of being in a clift with a vertigo attack.

3187,"Following on from what I said in a post made by Beth about How do you know when you've met the right person (or at least someone who could make you happy)  Where I wrote the following:Quote ""I guess in a nutshell this is saying there is no 'how' about it - you just will!55 Abundance - perhaps that when it's the right person it will fill you up and you will just know - and changing to Peace perhaps that you will feel relaxed and know it's right when you meet him - so in theory it should be simple! You just have to wait for him to come along and presumably a good feeling will overwhelm you with no doubts undermining it... I wonder if that actually happens to people though?I don't know what love is - I seem to be drawn to a person, but if they then show a real interest back - I shy away - or find myself more attracted to someone else who makes me nervous and feel butterflies but who I know deep down probably wouldn't go for me - even if they do seem to be charming!  Or maybe it's just friendliness and because I like them I take it that way...What I'm trying to say, inarticulately, is that it looks like the Yi is saying when you meet the right person you'll just know - everything will fall into place and be perfect on every level... sounds great - something to hope for, but does it really happen that way? Or does it build - or do you generally have to accept that they are perhaps not your ideal vision but you get on well and are attracted to the person and so you should realise that it's a good opportunity to be in a happy and equal relationship? As I said I seem to sabotage any chance of having a proper boyfriend, because I end up fantasising about the ones who are probably unavailable, eventhough I am attracted to the ones I feel more comfortable with and who give me something back - I still end up rejecting them, and someone (probably) out of reach will preoccupy my idealised romantic notions... usually the one that I can't make eye contact with ie am too shy to be myself with!  So it all goes down the pan.. Does this suggest, my inability to make eye contact, that I know subconsiously that this person is not on my level emotionally?"" There are 2 guys that I have been considering recently, though I don't know them well at all only a couple of encounters so probs a bit hasty but still...  I asked the Yi which one would be better for me/ who do I have more, if any, chance with.Person A (who I like more, but perhaps for the wrong reasons (see above))Hex 55 UnchangingOr person B (who perhaps seems more interested but I'm less attracted too, which perhaps wouldn't be the case if person A didn't exist - lol)Hex 17.3 Following to 49 Revolution.Sigh - I don't know - What do you think?I'm always wrong in matters of love - I think I am too idealistic ebout it sometimes...  it's just I feel it would be nice to have a companion of some sort at the mo..

Then I asked HOW can I provide him the nourishment he needs?

I thought that he would be ""proud"" of me if I did it... Of course this person was not aware of that, it was just my own thing. As I was hesitating too much, I realized what was the problem and sent him an email asking him to hold off with making the arrangements, telling him that what I wanted was to go with him instead (the retreat was with a group of people and not necessarely him). I asked to the I Ching - what he would think about what me holding off the retreat plans. I received 25.1.2.3 to 44.What is your interpretation of this reading? :bows:"
3192,"I have been consulting for manymonths now. PLease help me; What is the implication of DIRECTION in certain hexagrams? Many times I have received for example hex.39 'TROUBLE' which indicates that 'the south and the west are favourable.' Does this mean that should  I literally (and physically) move in either of these directions in connection with my plans so that I might avoid the trouble forewarned against?If not, what else could this mean? I have had it before with K'un and thought that since I now live in London having used to live to the NE in Norwich that my friends there would be lost to me.I am also confused by the fact that the Chinese have traditonally had north at the bottom and south at the top. DOes this mean I reverse the poles, and hence travelling EAST OR NORTH is instead a good idea .......i m soooo confused. "

I asked if reality is as sad as I see it in regards to my relationship with someone and I received 54.5, changing to 58.I asked this because I feel I might be with too much stress and see all black when in reality, something else might happen. I saw that this line is not too bad, but I would like to listen for how you would describe it based on my question.Thank you"

I really would love to help him on his quest, however, it would mean that I make a big step towards a new venture. I like new ventures, but as much as I enjoy being with my friend, this proposal adds more people in the spectrum, so in a way it is a challenge.I just want to make sure that by accepting this proposal I am doing it because it's the right thing, as, in spite I want to help my friend, this would also affect my life. should I accept this proposal? 31.1.4 to 63.What do you think?"

Mmmm, with a smile in my face, I asked: do I have ANYTHING special that he sees on me? I received 40.4.6, moving to 4. I was reading LiSe's on this and it was a lot nicer than what I read on Wilhelm.

I have mixed emotions as to what to do. I do want to exchange and practice, and I also want to meet new people who share the same interests than me. But I don't know if I am ready yet, if I have learned enough to understand the true purpose of what I am or will be doing. I'm quite scared for this opportunity to be honest, to start this new venture, and also scared of not doing it just because of my fear to do something new. I asked:what is the I Ching advice about joining this group? 64.1.6 to 54.It didn't feel like a total ""yes, go ahead"" or ""no, back up"". I saw some caution in this reading. would I find what I am looking for by joining this group? 33.1.6 to 49.

3199,"Hello Forum,I have been reading an excellent thread about 44.4 that has helped me to understand the meaning of ""not fish in the tank"" mentioned in this line. I have been trying to apply it to my question and got a little confused though.There's a situation that I have been going around for some time, and asked a few times to the Yi about it, and because of the readings and my own attitude it seems that I am all over the surface of this situation, looking as its depth, but never getting into it. I am focusing on things that I can recognize as irrelevant while I can sense I have a ""goldmine"" in front of my eyes but I just keep dancing around, always in the surface. I can perceive this attitude in myself, but I don't know how to break this superficial trend and dive in this situation. Today, I asked ""what is my attitude towards this person"" and I received 13.4.5 > 22.  I understood once again that my friendliness doesn't go too far, too deep. As I mentioned, I received on other readings similar responses, particularly my lack of commitment towards a situation that is a lot more bigger of what I can see (I don't know what this ""bigger"" means though, as, like the reading says, I just keep on the surface of things). Most of the readings I made about this specific connection are positive, although they remind me to be humble, to accept what I receive, to trust,... and yet, when I ask about my attitude, I receive that I am not deepening enough what this connection is about. Well, today I am trying to fix, if possible, this. I asked: what can I do to deepen my feelings towards X and I received 44.4.  After reading that thread and other resources, it seemed to me a description of my attitude. I also thought about ""no fish in the tank = there's nothing to deepen here"". I am confused about this answer. Just to clarify this answer, I asked ""is there fish in the tank in my relationship with this person"" and I received 51.5 > 17.  i don't know if I over-complicated things here, but I am more confused that ever.  I do feel that these answers are referring to inner aspects from myself that I am not grasping...Just FYI: this is not a romantic relationship per se, it is a very important connection in my life for sure. I don't want to put any limit into as where is this going.Thanks for your help... I know there are a lot of good minds and souls in this forum who can understand this a lot better that I do. Sam"
3200,"Hi, this is my first time posting and I thank you in advance for your advice!My company is downsizing due to economic recession, however has been very positive about creating a new role for me.  I gave up another offer w potentially higher income on current company's promise of a 'growth' position I would be very excited about.  The compensation promised verbally was substantially higher then what was eventually offered a week ago.  Since verbally accepting position I have been told that my base salary will also be affected by about 20% (I receive salary plus housing and commissions).  I asked the yi should I stick this position out and received 9.4.  This I interpreted as advice to stay centered and calm, that fear would vanish and that I would feel new courage.  I asked whether I would receive the salary promised me verbally last week and received 31.1.2.  From researching the forum, I am guessing the advice is to stick through the negotiations rather than look elsewhere.  However is there any indication here of the result of negotiations?I also asked what was there for me to do to make this job work for me at the agreed-upon compensation as I have understood it (I know, a bit redundant) and received 63.1.2.  I think the advice here again is to wait patiently, however again is there any indication on which way the negotiations will go?"
3201,"Hello,I had 2 questions when I asked the oracle.First is, will me and the person in question get together this lifetime. I feel very spiritually drawn to him. 14,4,5 to 9 (i think)My interpretation is that it will take a long time, as 14, line 4 seems good, but not line 5?and next, will I be successful in my personal goal? it says 57 (nothing to do with the first question, its a career goal).I interpret it as needing to find a correct advisor, and pray?thank you if u can help me clear this up."
3202,"Hello all!I wanted to tell you that I love this forum. When I found it, I started to study the I Ching and slowly, I am starting to understand some, but still, I need a lot of help. I just discovered the search index and I love it. I was looking for some guidance there and I found some, but I am still unsure of what I received.I asked to the I Ching how would I recognize my man and I received 55.2.4 to 11. I found some answers in this forum about that, and I think I got it clear. I asked afterwards, is X my man? and I received Hex. 1, no changing lines. I read that 1 is about energy, creative energy, and as something creative I could take it as a yes, but I read as well that this is energy that doesn't go anywhere, like it could be nice but nothing happens.  I wanted to ask you what you think on this. Thank you. BethPS: you rock guys!"
3203,"Hello,It's been a while since I last used this sight - I posted a while ago about volunteering in a poor country and what to expect - the advice I received from the Yi definitely applied!  I had a great time, learnt a lot and made some good friends.  It also opened my eyes to new cultures and the important things in life that seem to have been over-shadowed in this country by money and egos (in some cases not all!)So that experience was great for me, as I suffer from low confidence etc - the country was so beautiful and the experience so stimulating that I could hardly be depressed - although of course there were low moments.  However I have now returned to Britain, and my worries, anxieties and problems are back - not to mention the return of my insomnia which completely disappeared when I was halfway across the world!  Anyway, the reason I am posting is that for a few months, and while I was away I have been worrying about the prospect of living with a group of people.  owever I decided that, though it probably wouldn't be perfect, it was my best option.  I now feel that was a mistake as I don't feel I have a proper connection with those I am living with so I'm worried flat-sharing will turn to resentment (as they are also a tight group - I don't fit in).  Basically,  I should have listened to my instincts and taken a chance on the unknown!  But I am here now, so perhaps I should try and make the best of it - I will be starting a new job soon which may help.  I do like the people I am living with, but I dn't think I klick with them or on the same wavelength as them - and travelling and making new friends has reminded me how great and freeing that is!  I don't feel comfortable or like I can be myself and I'm also finding it very hard to sleep here.  But I feel like it may be to late and I should stick it out for the next 6 months?  As moving out would a) cost me financially and b) be awkward - definitely lose me friends, albeit not close ones - I'm sure they wouldn't take real offence but they would probably feel scornful.So I'm asking - Should I up sticks and cut my losses before it gets worse or stick it out?  I suppose it may get easier - but I've known these people a while and if a proper friendship hasn't arisen perhaps it never will.  It's just that I am happiest when I have people around me who I feel understands me...I have completely rambled here...  So the answer I received was 35 Unchanging - progress.Does that suggest things will get better here?  Or should I heed the last line 'perseverance in such overenergetic behaviour, especially towards persons with whom there is no close connection, will lead to humiliation'.Perhaps I am being a coward - not wanting to move out because I don't want the humiliation and bad feeling of it... I just feel like kicking myself for not listening my instincts and willfuly not accepting the truth - I knew this would happen! "

I wonder if 37 is pointing to that.what is the I Ching advice regards the development of my career? 45.1.5.6 to 21.

3210,"I am curious about how 37.2 relates in the context of a marriage question. For example, Does the person want to marry her? hex 37.2at first glance it looks like a yes, because 37 signifies family. and the interpretations seem to talk about a woman, instead of a man, that this question refers to. Does it mean the man has a sense of duty, so he feels he should marry her, OR, does it mean that he will want her to tend to him (and family)?9.2 speaks of a blockage and retreat. It seems to contradict 37.2. any thoughts appreciated "

Now, nobody seems to have noticed that so it seems it is just inside me. In any case, when I was just hoping to fall asleep so I stopped the thinking and worries, a certainty came to my heart, like a current, a feeling that I was loved by ""him"".  . And then, all the little sweet words that he said today while we talked and that somehow dessapeared when I got stucked for the one thing he said that reminded me a traumatic teenager love I had time ago... Oh well,... I had this certainty coming and my heart suddenly calmed down. As my mind was still striving with disbelief, I asked to the I Ching: I feel that he loves me. Is my feeling right? 58.2 to 17 was the answer. For the commentaries I am reading, the answer seems to comfirm  my feeling, or maybe not totally... How would you take this answer?Thank you!Kitty"

3216,"Hi Forum, I see that in this forum there are so many people looking for answers about love... This is my first post here and I really hope you can help me to view clearly what are is the path I need to take with my ""problem"". I've been learning how to read the I Ching for a couple of months now, and in spite I don't have experience, I have been amazed for the responses I receive. I've been forming a friendship with a lovely man, who has been very good to me in many many aspects from my life. I started experiencing situations I never experienced before and, although I feel extremely confused, I also feel that I am following the right path with him. Even when I feel totally at home with him, I still don't understand his world. I feel like standing at the edge of a cliff, with a beautiful, deep and immense ocean in front, where I would like to jump, but just the thought of hitting myself on the rocks scares me to death... I feel I am inevitable falling in love, and I feel his care, because this is how he is... a lovable person who loves people. I never met anyone who is so capable of giving so much love and care, yet he acts like this way with many people, not only with me... This is the reason I am falling in love and also the reason why I am scared to death (literally). The point is that when I feel I am handling properly (maintaining the middle way, being in the present, meditating and feeling the peace in my heart). Then something happens -like last weekend, where we were supposed to get together but we couldn't sudden problems, and at the moment when we hang up,  I started to cry and cry like a child because I wanted to see him so hard... but I only felt that when he said he wasn't coming. So, it seems that I cannot do much for ""controlling my feelings"". I'm sorry for this long post... I wanted to give you some details of what happens inside me in case it helps you to help me understand. I asked the I Ching: please help me to understand the situation between R. and I. I received 49 unchanging.  Well,... this answer just confirmed what I explained before, so, indeed there is something new that, at least for me, envelopes what 49 represents. So this is how it is then.I asked: what is the best way to deal with my feelings for him? I received 18.1 moving to 26. For what I was reading, it is telling me that the way to deal with my feelings has to let old patterns go. This is very appropriate as the way that my friend and I relate is surely not conventional. It is reinforcing hex. 49 I believe. But, does it tell me how? So, I asked, what are the chances of developing a romantic relationship with him (even if it is unconventional) and I received 52.2.4 moving to 50, and this seems to tell me to stop, to calm, to keep still, to meditate. I could understand if the I Ching answered my question or asked me to not ask about this until this revolutionary state calms down. My last two question were an attempt to know about my presence in his life... I asked who I am in his life: 1.2.4.6 moving to 63. And last question: does he know what is happening to me about him? 35.1.4 moving to 27. I hope you can give me your thoughts on these last two.Again, sorry for long post as debut on this forum. I am a bit crazy today with my heart bumping so hard, ... trying to calm down and apply hex. 52. I hope you can help me to find some peace in my heart. Thank you."

You are fat!. Felling my heart broken, and feeling that yes, it was true that I was too fat for him, I told him: okay... whatever... you will not hear anymore about me. And I left his place. But moments later, I wanted to go back to tell him a lot of things I had inside, starting with reminding him all the times where he was telling me how beautiful and lovable I was. I also wanted to make sure that whatever I gave him to him he was not using it anymore... but I couldn't find his house at all, and as sure as I was that I was in the right street, the hose seemed to vanish.Well, it was not a nice dream and I was wondering if this dream was just showing my fears or if it was really a message from my subconscious about something I cannot see straight away.I asked the I Ching what was the dream about and received 18.5.6 moving to 48.I also asked if the dream was showing what my friend feels truly about me and received 8.2.4 moving to 47.Do you know what this mean?Thank you so much for your help!"

By dislike I mean despise, by despise I mean I'd be dancing in the streets if a dirty bomb hit. first off I've got What is the point of my being in Bend. I received 34 ,no changing lines. So I'm here to acquire 'great strength' maybe I ought to have asked what kind of great strength. I'll do that in a little bit, but I think it means knowledge or skills due to the intent behind the question which follows as question 3. Next was ""How do I achieve the great strength? I received 26 changing lines 2 and 5 to 62. Great exceeding to little exceeding, depending who one talks to exceeding of any kind is bad. To have both exceedings disturbs me a little. Then again both according to Blofeld are success which is a good thing. Third: Is car audio the right field for me? Got 16 for this so to me that's a yes. Last: Who will help me achieve the great strength? Got 25 changing lines 5 and 6 to 51."
3232,What does the IC see for me and a guy I already had a brief affaire with and who came visiting me yesterday.8.1 sounds great to me ;-)But what about the changing into 3?Thanks in advance.
3233,"hex.40 as an answer at relationship questions (regarding confusing, uncertain situations ) makes me wonder if it is about the separation or about the release from tension but continuing togetheri put this question (after an explanation /argue with my boyfriend ): ""what will be the evolution of our relation from now on?"" and the answer was 40 unchanginganother question about my love affair  formulated today gave me the answer 54.9- 40 (""how would he like that i approach him and the relationship with him ?

3234,"Hi Everyone,It's  been awhile since I have been online here. Alot has happened since I was last here. Got back together with an ex (NOT the married guy), was pregnant but had a miscarriage.After that I just withdrew from all the drama and started focusing on work and my son even more. As well as focusing on spiritual and personal growth.So recently I started to date again. I met a man who on first glance has alot in common with me. We read the same books, view the world pretty much in the same light and have similar goals in mind.But for some reason I am feeling very alarmed by his intensity towards me. It's like alarm bells are going off. We have only had four dates but he seems so into me so fast that I am getting scared off.I also notice things that concern me. He has a good job but I fear that he may be too impulsive with money and decisions in life. For example, he accidently bought two cars (signed a contract for both) so he has to put one up for sell before it's even arrived. He wants to buy a farm in Scottland (his home) but his plan sounds really unwise to me. He doesn't have the cash on hand for the down payment so he and a friend want to work something out so that the friend provides cash up front for a piece of the land and he will use that as the downpayment.He won't generate and profit from the farm so it's just going to be a huge mortgage and he won't even be living on it (we live in Germany).His plan seems impulsive to me.He hasn't spoke to his own mother more than twice in 18 years. That alarms me as well. Even if she is as selfish as he says, it concerns me.On our fourth date (last night) he brought me a small gift bag instead of a rose. In it was over 100€ worth of gifts. That is very kind but it seemed too much for the fourth date.On the other hand, we have alot in common. But I am just alarmed and can't say what is scaring me.I myself have fallen in love at first site before and I have felt intense towards a man or two in my time So why am I alarmed?I have considered that maybe I am just scared of anyone that could be good for me so I am looking for something wrong with him. I just don't know!!!So I asked the IC today:""Tell me what I need to know about X"" it answered 42 Increase, unchangingThen I asked, ""please clarify that answer""And it answered, 54.4 The Marrying MaidenThe Maiden draws out the alotted time and a late marriage comes in due course (am quoting loosely)I then asked:should I develop a romantic relationship with X or back off now?And I got 51 ShockThe line was 3 and 5ix in the third place means:Shock comes and makes one distraught.If shock spurs to actionOne remains free of misfortune.Six in the fifth place means:Shock goes hither and thither.Danger.However, nothing at all is lost.Yet there are things to be done.When I asked, ""Is X going to be responsible with money and job?""I got Youthful Folly, unchanging..of course.I could really use some clarity here. Either my subconscious is warning me, OR I just have an issue with being with good men and run away from them (it might be a combination of both)"
3235,"One  more question... I asked the I Ching if between him and I there is mutual interested and I received 10.4.It seems to me that, besides the caution, the I Ching had answered positively. Is this what you think about this answer?Thanks again!"
3236,"Hi All!!!Once again I ask our help to understand this reading. I asked the I Ching ""what do I need to know about the development of my relationship with this person"". I asked this because I might have some challenges to deal with, before I can meet this person again.  I asked before if I was going to see this person soon and received 20.1 moving to 42, which I thought it was an advice to look at the situation with maturity, which made me think on the challenges I had to deal with first.  Then I asked if I was going to be able to continue with the course where I meet this person and I received 8.1.3.4 to 49... which I didn't understand really. This is why my final question comes: what do I need to know about the development of this relationship. Thank you so much for your always helpful insight.Daisy"
3237,"worries,ruminations about the relation with my boyfriend (things aren't clear at all between us, lack of communication from his part,doesn't help me to find up where we stay as a couple... ); i say to me probably our relationship is only at the begginng for him or he need more time than me to get an idea and i have to calm down and wait etcalthough i asked IC:""is he the right man for me, will he bring something positive in my life?"" 45.5-16 is this a promising answer for a more satisfactory relationship? or is not?"

3239,"So, there is this girl whom I'm very much attracted to and I think is very interesting. I asked the I-Ching what should I expect if I were to pursue a relationship with her and I came up with Hexagram 58, 31. I found the second hexagram interesting because her and I are, in fact, opposites on some level or another. She is fiercely independent while I am fairly dependent. She has a somewhat serious personality while I'm more carefree and exuberant. Now, to the casual reader this seems like a death trap! Though, from what I'm getting is that there may be some potential between us (seeing that opposites attract!). On the other hand, I still feel a bit confused and would love some insight! Much Obliged. :bows:"
3240,"Hi guys,I'm totally new here ,and a foreigner, so i hope to be able to express myself clearly enough.I have been envolved in a love relatioship with a man whom i met 22 years ago, when i was living overseas.It was a rather short and unsuccessfull affair , as he was engaged.Last year i found him in the internet and we started mailing , our feeling flourished.Now he is divorced but seems to like his freedom.This year we met , there good times and tough moments, but when i was coming back to my country , he wanted to go on with our bond.I was in two minds, as i felt we could have steyed together much more than we did.Apart from that , i think he's quite inflexible as for his own space , his independence. He mailed to me , expressing longing, but that sounden like ;ok, now that you are gone, i can talk about missing you.Some days ago he mailed that he loved me, i could not bring myself to being as spontaneous as before.I still care, but i am emotionally stuck.Consequently, he has become silent, or even harsh.Today i asked I Ching1. What attitude i should take now, got 17.6 > 252. Diagnosis of the relationship, i got 12.1.3> 133. His position in the relatioship , 9.3>614. His feelings 63.4.6 >135.

3243,"My 13 yr old girl has been suffering twitching in her neck for some seven months now it is getting very painful for her. The GP has found nothing wrong and refuses to even see it as twitching, he says her neck pain is causing the twitching. Her neck pain started four months after the twitching but to be honest I have no faith in orthodox treatment I have only taken her to the GP to rule out any underlying problems. I think it is due to my break up with my partner about seven months ago, it was a messy end and this caused stress in our household. I have asked the I ching what is causing this twitching and I received Hexagram 35, I asked how can we ease/eliminate the twitching and received Hexagram 34 any help appreciated. Thanks"
3244,"hello,is it a good idea to ask the i ching for conclusive/ final answers?i meen in times of confusion ... asking for a final result including words like ""never"" or ""ever"".cause when i did that, i got many changing lines that are very hard to interpret and seem to be contradictorily.(example: 51.1.4.6 > 23)whats you experience?maybe you say: never say never (even to the i ching)... but there are some questions in life and some decisions one have to make that are very essential for anything that is coming in the future..."
3245,"I am in confusion, because of my impending applications to school. I asked if I should proceed for applying, and 9.6 to 5 was the answer. I tried to interpret it, as meaning that I should wait and not advance at all? But I am confused. If I don't apply, nothin will come out of it. Is the hexagram saying that I should not apply at all? I do not know what is advised here.I hesitate applying because I am not sure about the demands of the new course I am applying into. I have seeked career counseling but I have not felt like they have been real helpful for making a decision.I asked myself, so I just apply, what is the big deal? The deal is I need to get letters of recommendation and I do not feel I have performed to my best yet.. and the applications close soon. Nine at the top means:The rain comes, there is rest.This is due to the lasting effect of character.Perseverance brings the woman into danger.The moon is nearly full.If the superior man persists,Misfortune comes.I am not sure what is meant by ""perseverence"" here. Does it mean continuation? And that I should not persist in application?Thanks for any advice."

3248,"Hi!  I'm new to this.  I asked the I Ching how it would benefit me to receive a certain treatment for depression and received Hexagram 37, The Family, with no moving lines.

3249,"Hello,I was hoping you could share your views on this response I received from the I Ching, because I want to understand if I am deluding myself or not, and I don't want to delude myself when interpreting either. I asked the I Ching: am I deluding myself when I think that it is possible to achieve this?The answer was 4.5 moving to 59. I am very interested to know what you think about this.Thank you."

I asked another question, this time, does L have feelings for me? I got 4.5>59.

I asked what is his attitude towards me, I got9.3->61Line 3 is about quarrels and yes, indeed, there were quarrels between us. But more specifically, this line says that a person who thought had an easy victory, is now proved wrong. One version sas that one tried to dominate a mild person. Are these his thoughts? It is true that the problem between us is that he indeed thought that I will be more ""simple"", but now he says to me that I am ""too intelligent and have too much integrity"" (this is a bad thing, I guess if you work for a boss). Can someone explain some more about this line, please?Is hexagram 61 relevant here? It is about sincerity...I asked how he feels about me and I got 52.6He is at peace now because all the conflicts seized. The thing is, that I can be very subservient if needed and now I discovered that he indeed wants that...I don't mind actually, because it is just a job. I think all the bosses are the same, anyway, I guess.I also asked how I should behave and I got 9 unchanging.Well, this is clear, tame my power, take care of small tings, be nice and try to influence him with my kindness and with a soft touch.Does anyone sees anything else here?

3258,"Hello there! I hope you can help me to find a good solution on this... We have a client that is quite difficult to deal with sometimes. He's an interesting person to work with but at the same time, sometimes he messes up so much with the work we just did that we need to constantly re-work what was finished, and we need to keep fixing what he keeps breaking. He gets frustrated because nothing works, we get frustrated because we never can move on onto something new and we cannot prevent him to put his hands on what he are working on. We have talked to him about this and he accepts that his interventions are a problem, but he soon forgets about this and we have another ""crisis"" again. What we would like to know is what we have to do with this client, which potentially is a good client, but he can also become a problem... what should we do with him? 63.1.4.5 > 62. It seems to me that we have to be constantly on guard... this is what you see? I didn't see any clear sign of leave him or keep him, so I asked: what are the Yi comments on our idea of stopping working with him? 22.2.3.5 > 61.

3262,"Due to recent changes regarding a relationship, I consulted the IC to ask for advice and insight on the situation.  I received Hex 53, lines 3 and 6, changing into hexagram 8.  I've found different interpretations for these.  For example in Hex 53, line 3 and line 6 seem to contradict one another, as 3 indicates mistakes made and the other indicates the right thing (choice?) being done/made.  This seems to tell me that I've don the right thing and I've done the wrong thing.  Could someone help me with your opinion/thougts on this reading?How do the line interpretation go?  Is it an evolution of an experience, as in line 1 changes through line 6 and all the lines in between as varying experiences of that situation?Also, I consulted again as hexagram 8 suggests this...  Thinking I'd receive more specific insight and understandng without having to ask for help....Then, I received the same 53.3.6 changing to 8!  Hmmmmmmm??????   So, again I asked for more clear insight into this(is this correct to do or too much on the same question?)Then I received hex 10, lines 2 and 6, changing to hex 17.This seems like a fairly positive reading, but I would realy appreciate insight and advice from all of you with experience in reading with IC.Thank you again for this informative site and for all your kindness and assistance in my learning!"

Things are moving veeery slowly but the Yi has been an amazing councel in showing me the way.I'm still not sure if this is a physical or spiritual bond but recently and out of the blue got 50.6 to 32. Lastly I got some answers that implied that there is sth dark or hidden involved -some embarrassment or hidden agenda. I asked if I am putting myself to danger by still keeping faith in him. I got 22.1 to 522 days later I asked if there is sth I should know about the whole thing. I got 52.1 to 22LiSe's translation says for 22.1:Initial 9 : Energetic in one's feet. Abandon cart and go on foot.Anything you do which is really you is beautiful and creative. Be wary of the danger of tools and examples. Every use of them takes part of your own doing away. They add possibilities and comfort, will maybe bring admiration - but people always long back to the good old uncomfortable days when life was still simple and real. Tools bring the accomplishments of today, your own creativity connects to the eternal sources. (Changes to hex.52)Click to expand...and for 52.1:Initial 6 : Stabilize one's toe. Without fault. Harvest: everlasting determination.Walk in your own life. Do what you think you should do, not what others try to make you do. ‘Others’ can be people, or wishes, adapting, fears, everything which is not your deepest root.(Changes to hex.22)Click to expand...I'm starting to think that perhaps the Yi is telling me that I'm using it as a tool in order to get to a safe place faster than I should and that I am relying too much on it. In other words, that I should drop the questions on that particular issue and go on walking . .  22 has given me a hard time here, can't really see yet how it is involvedwhat would be your take on it?(by the way, I have stopped asking but I'm still wondering about my interpretations here . .)thnx for taking the time with this rather long postrodaki"
3274,"Okay... this is not a question of life or death, but I am in the situation when I need to choose between to little cats that I haven't met yet. Naturally, I would choose the colourful one, and that was the obvious choice, but suddenly, when I started asking the Yi just to see - because I never did it before in this way- I started to feel a thing for the black kitty. I made the mistake to make too many questions... basically because the first time I asked I wasn't specific (question a); then, the second question seemed to change the original answers (question b) so then I asked a third question. I asked to the Yi - a) what about:b) what are the comments of the Yi about taking home:c) is the ..... kitty the best one for me?The black kitty:a) 37.3.5 > 27b) 34.1.2 > 62c) 37.2.3 > 61The four-colours kitty: a) 28.5 > 32b) 17.2 > 58c) 2.1.6 > 27I hope you don't think these questions are too stupid...  I am not asking for a full analysis here, but an impression of which one is the ONE. Thank you!SamLast edited: Oct 8, 2008"

3276,"Hi,What does 33,2,4 say about a person's love for another? It does highlight a splitting, doesn't it? The question is is there still love from them? Does it mean they are still clinging, and is trying hard to withdraw? thank u for any suggestions."

3279,"Hi guys, I am currently facing real financial difficulties and trying to find a solution. I consulted the oracle asking'how can I solve my present financial difficulties?' I received hex 1 line3 changing to hex 10. Now this seems positive to me but I am still confused. Am I correct in thinking a man will help with this? Please explain!"
3280,"I came up with these on a request of my general situation. To make sure I interpreted the hexagrams correctly, here's a rough diagram of what I came up with. Before anything else, tell me if I did something wrong here.------------ x ------   --------------- x ------------Without any context, what might this mean? My general understanding is that 22 indicates grace or simplicity, and 9 indicates caution or inefficient/slow progress, but more thorough interpretations were hard to find, especially for Hex 9."
3281,"Hi,I haven't posted in quite some time, but I reference the wisdom on the board regularly and appreciate it.  Today I decided to finally ask for some opinions and experiences of 46.3 Whenever I receive it I feel unsure as to whether the Yi is saying something like, ""there is nothing there for you,"" or if it is saying, ""there is nothing to this line of questioning"" as in whatever you are worried about will not be an issue.  I have read many translations of the line and though more seem to point toward the latter, I received the line once when I was asking about travelling to a place that had strong ties to my past(a trip that I was feeling VERY apprehensive) and I really felt like the Yi was saying kind of, yes, you are going (I had multiple reasons I why I felt like I needed to make this journey) but that really there was nothing much there for me anymore.  One could argue that it was saying, it will be a smooth trip, not to worry, but I though some of my fears may not have been realized, some of them were and I found the trip quite difficult.So, wondering how others view or relate to this line.  Thanks in advance for the replies.Peace,MayaP.S. There is one other interpretation I have contemplated when I have received this line in certain situations and that is, what if the Yi is saying you are pushing upward but what you are pushing toward is not there yet nor not yet ready.  It can feel a bit like a cautioning in that context.Last edited: Oct 8, 2008"
3282,"Hello all,I sent yesterday an email to this guy I'm falling for and today I felt a bit anxious about it, perhaps because I added a song that I wrote to him and -even when he will not understand the lyrics because it is in another language and it doesn't say extreme things or there is no declaration of love, I exposed myself a lot more that usual. I just asked to the I Ching ""was it a mistake to send that email""? and I received as response 32.3.4 moving to 15. For what I read in other post and books, it is telling like I am looking for something in the wrong place... Before I jumped into conclusions I wanted to ask you how would you read this answer based on the question I made. I did other follow up questions: what did he feel about song? 19, unchanging.what is the best attitude I can have towards my insecurities about my situation with him? 41, unchanging. Thank you as alsways for your help,Julia"
3283,"I asked if Bush would hand over power after the election for the inauguration in January to the winner of the 11/08 election, I got 55.2.3-54In Sam Reifer's book he has 55 saying that ""When the administrator achieves prosperity he need not fear replacement, Be like the sun at noon, Improvement.I thought that was very scary.55.2 he says ""you are being willfully eclipsed by someone. Do not try to change the situation, you will be met with hatred and mistrust...He cannot deny to himself or you that he has usurped your place...55.3 he says ""The situation you brought to a successful conclusion has been taken completely out of your hands. you have no position in it...You can taste none of the fruits of your success.54 reads ""Ominous, action brings failure.The reason I asked is because I think we will have election (8.4-45) and I had a dream that Obama was vice president but was very sad and Dick Cheney was there.

I asked before and Meng's explanation of my feelings was quite helpful to me. :This ""thing"" appears to be a tenacious and quite powerful force, and you modify or transmute the force through sadness, which gives you a sense of peace or togetherness within yourself.

3290,"Hi there,This is my first post, and I am quite excited for starting learning the I Ching. Sorry for my English as well, I will try to write clearly. I am falling inlove for a man who is a kind of friend. The other night, I had an interesting dream: I know it was him, but in the dream it was Sawyer (the hotty from Lost) and he was coming to me, telling me: ""hey, I'm here, I came to make you happy"". I was pleasantly surprised for this ""gift"" from heaven, but at the same time I was very afraid of being abandoned by him after he made me happy ). In the dream, he was there, ""in the present"", and I couldn't enjoy the present because I was fearing about the future. Well, this is precisely what happen with me in regards to my friend. For me it is a learning experience, a powerful connection that is taking me to the present moment, but, as in my dream, I start thinking and thinking ""what will happen"" and ""will he want to be with me tomorrow?"" I know it sounds silly but I still cannot help it. My understanding with the I Ching is not too big now, so I hope you can help me to understand these answers. I asked:what is happening emotionally between us? 40.1.5 - 58is he attracted to me? 62.4 - 15what can I do to have a closer relationship with him? 8.4 - 45Sorry for this long post. I hope it is clear and that you don't mind my questions.Thank you"
3291,"Hello all again,Without knowing if this is true or not, I have been feeling quite sad because I cannot see visible clues from this guy that I really like, that he likes me. He's considerate, he seems to enjoy my company, but he does not go the ""extra mile"" for me --as far as I know. I don't know if it's good to ask about his feelings to the I Ching... but I did ask ""what the I Ching could tell me about my sadness for not being ""someone special"" for him and I received 15.3, changing to 2. I found quite interesting receiving 15, and line 3, as per what I read, talks about not looking for recognition. However, I wonder how you see this answer based on my question... Sometimes I feel I shouldn't even pay attention for these things but then I feel that it is always nice to feel that someone ""needs"" us... Thanks!!!"

Wait for the right moment to act.Line 6: If you do not communicate about your situation the way will close. Tell people about it!

3294,"Hi everyone! I am new to this forum--although I've been throwing the I Ching for about 3 years. It's such a marvellous pleasure to have found this forum. No one in my walking world uses the I Ching and it's great to give/receive encouragement and insight so! I am happy to be here. I threw the I Ching this afternoon about a complicated past love affair I am feeling very activated by right now. I have a deep intuition that this man is going to get in touch with me again very soon. I am, for the record, currently partnered and *content*.I threw #51 ""Shocking"", with a changing line in the second position--which changes into #54 ""The Marrying Maid""--a hexagram I used to throw about this man all the time. (It probably goes without saying that he left me for another woman.) So it *seemed* to me as if the I Ching was saying, ""Remember what happened? Don't go there again."" So then I asked the I Ching, how does this situation work out if I choose to ignore any attempted engagement and process my feelings privately? I threw #45 Assembling with changing lines in the 1st and 5th positions, which turned right back into #51, Shocking, again. I don't really know what to make of this and I think it's because I am too close to it. Does anyone have some insight--something I might not be seeing? Does shocking always indicate an earth-shattering life event or can it mean something more...nuanced?I appreciate any and all feedback greatly. Be well, FSLast edited: Oct 6, 2008"
3295,"Hi, I was wondering if you had opinions about the following reading. I was seeking advice about whether to end a relationship with a certain person (we don't seem to share the same feelings about each other, and my reaction is to get out of the situation completely). I used three coins. Heads, yang (3), Tails, yin (2).... I received Hexagram 53 with lines 1, 2 and 5 moving. From what I understand, Hexgram 53 changes to 26. It sounds like I shouldn't make any rash moves, but then again, I'm not certain at all. The advice from the moving lines is confusing. Thanks for any advice."

He needs very subservient people - I realized that now, up till now I believed that he appreciated my intelligence and my integrity. He said some things to me which were really bellow any dignity.It is a rather complicated situation and it would be difficult to explain all the details here...the thing is that in the beginning he needed my knowledge and integrity to cope with some situations at work, and now he is sending me away because of these same qualities.I aksed Yi Jing to help me with this:Give insight into this situation between me and my boss:I got 5 unchanging.Well, I guess I need to wait and see, it is true that the situation is now pending, he said he would do everything he can to find me a new job (he has connections).How should I act in this situation?64.2->35Wait, I feel like I want to take action (I would like to tell him how I feel), but I shouldn't.How the situation will develop?60 unchanging.Well, I will need to restrain myself and not show my true feelings.Then I ask: How should I behave with him?I got 42.5->27I really don't understand this fifth line...should I be forgiving, or what??I would really appreciate your help here, please.

This is the first time I post something, but I have been checking out this site quite often. It's a great community.I am new to the I Ching and don't have much experience with interpreting the hexagrams, so I will need your help to understand these results I received. Last August I was diagnosed with a ""not serious"" gynecological problem.  The recommendations from my doctors was just letting it go by itself and some pills to help the process, and this is what I am doing. My normal physical processes have been messed up but it seems to be ""normal"" based on the situation. My next appointment with the doctor is in a a couple of weeks, and in the meantime, I thought of tossing the coins and see what is the I Ching advice so I can recuperate as soon as possible and retake my ""normal"" life. I asked about the state of my health and received 25.4, moving to 42. I asked about the I Ching advice for healing faster and received 31.1.2.4.6 moving to 9. I would be very grateful if you could explain to me what these readings mean.Thank you so much,Rosa"
3302,"A short back story...Me and a girl who I live with through circumstance only started spending a lot time together and falling in love.  Things were really good and flowing for a month, but then I felt a deep call to go away for a week for some intense spiritual work.As happens to me pretty often, when I came back my life had some really intense changing energy in it, and there was a lot of disintegration/chaos in my life, turmoil which will lead to better place for me in the end, I believe.Well this process is as painful as I try to hold onto the old and not surrender to the guidance of Spirit, so she watched me go through all this and just got really freaked out by the whole thing.  I had this feeling, and and we recently talked about and she confirmed it to me.. hard to hear!So I asked the I Ching, and it gave me 50.3... which to me seems to suggest that love is there, but will only come to fruition if I accept and surrender to my spiritual path, get over my self-doubt.  Only this will cause her to see what I'm doing isn't just insanity.. its actually taking me to a life of Vision...What do others think?"

3304,"Hello Thanks for readingI work in an office with my boss-- the other partner is out. I like him alot- more than a boss, he can be fun, great- attractive- it goes both ways. He can be very temperamental- He lashes out, doesn't give credit where it is due, and exagerates faults. When things are positive -- I feel great about work, when it is not (  up to him,) I feel quite the opposite. Last week I almost felt like quitting.I want to know how to handle things better- I either engage, strive to meet his standards, or finally, strike back ( calling him on his stuff immediately in his own manner), or withdraw till he evens out. I hate that I stay open, to feel positive, then take the road down with him. I asked: regardless of any attraction, positivity, how can I handle this with my own best interests in mind -- and received: 54- 2 I know the i ching pretty well- but would appreciate any insight. thanks"

3307,"It looks as if this year is bent on being a shaker-upper. Things were finally back on track with my fragile 8-year relationship after our worst crisis ever; I felt we had re-established our strong connection and were slowly building back trust. Then my partner left for a 5-week business trip, I welcomed a houseguest (a friend of a friend put this person in touch with me) and after spending lots of time getting to know her, I'm completely infatuated. It ""feels"" like being in love, although I'm too old and wise now to believe it's little more than an irrational seizure of chemicals. We had an awkward conversation acknowledging that we were both experiencing feelings, but agreed that we should drop the subject, since we are both in committed relationships. However, yesterday she finally left my apartment to move in to her own place, and left me a note that once again revealed her feelings, albeit in a subtle way. This has completely destabilized me, made me feel terribly guilty, and I'm completely overtaken with a desire to spend more time with her, because I don't know if I've ever felt a connection this overpowering. But I don't want to risk ruining my very real, mature partnership, which appears to have come out of a crisis intact. Here are the questions I asked the I Ching: ---I feel an overwhelming desire to be with this girl, to be in her company. What should my approach be? --- received 20, Contemplation, no changing lines. --Although I barely know this person, I'm feeling a kind of grief at the idea that this connection can never be explored, because it would be unethical to pursue it and I'm not willing to just give up on my relationship with my long-term partner, despite doubts. But it almost feels like I'm grieving this, however absurd... -- received hexagram 54.1, (The marrying maiden), leading to 40, Deliverance.--This has made me doubt whether I am with the right partner, if my partner can give me what I truly need. -- received 39.3, Obstruction, leading to 8, Holding Together.I would really appreciate any insight into this situation. I feel so guilty and fickle for developing such strong feelings for someone else after working so carefully to repair my relationship, and feeling things were going well. Thank you..."

I have been thinking about a person for some time now, but somehow I feel that there is something in me that doesn't let me explore this situation. I don't know if I can explain it properly... it's like I am not going to the depths of the situation, but stay just on the pleasurable aspect of the situation.I asked to the I Ching what are my real feelings for him and I received 56.3.6 moting to 16. I was quite surprised for this reading and didn't know how to take it, however my intuition tells me that my heart feels a little like a wanderer here.

I do not have sticks at home, and I do not cast coins either, I use, and I know I should not, on line reading.I have had a relationship that meant a world to me, we were together for 8 years,past 3 we were having a hard time...and it somehow became obvious we do net let eachother grow, so we tried and tried to separate and, through a silly fight we did, it was more as an excuse, this August, and have not bee in contact since.We have had a great relationship, I was starting to become aware of my mistakes,and I tried to move on, and I was sure I did, although a bond remained.To cut the long story short, he showed up on my graduation ceremony today, and he was positive and content in a way I remembered him from our beginnings. We talked, hugged, and we agreed we still love eachother very much, but he said it is best we move on, it might hurt now, but in long term....it was best.He said it was worth it and he is grateful for every second of it. And all I can think of is good times, our bond,and beginnings when we used to push eachother to be better persons, we just seemed to be meant for eachother...and then we took it for granted.I realized how much I loved him and missed him when we spoke on the phone, navigating him how to find the hall, he has been my sunshine for such a long time.I know we took each other for granted, I was a spoilt brat sometimes with dificult family situation, he was a loaner and not ready to commit.But I have seen his eyes, and feeling his hand in my...forgive me, but I need to chech if there is still a hope, or a way, or something worth saving...so I opened a reading.MY question was, please explain me the situation with X.

3311,"Hello all! I hope to receive your opinion on this...I asked to the YI about what is the best attitude I should have towards this situation in order to see it progressing, growing,  and I received 30.6.

Hex. 46 is about going upwards, step by step, self improvement. So, I could say that the response is, my attitude towards this situation to see it grow should be like someone who is determine to improve herself.Am I missing something on this message?

3313,"Hi, I need your help if possible for understanding this response from the I Ching.""what can I do to make this happen"" and I received 24.1.2.3.4.5 moving to 28. What does it mean??? Thanks in advance,Andi"
3314,"Dear all,I really need some help with a reading.I have been with my current ""boyfriend"" (we have a daughter) for almost 6 years. Before meeting him, I had just come out of a terrible marriage and spent four years alone. I had lost faith in all men, basically. We were friends before we actually dated, and went through a lot together.However, there has always been something holding me back, and I never manage to fully commit. I refuse to consider him a ""husband"" and am always re-evaluating my thoughts and feelings towards him. The problem is that I do not know if this is due to my past experience or something ""real"".My mother is not very fond of him, which also influences me, whether I like it or not. This, however, is also a little subjective because a rather stressful past event, in which my companion was actually right, caused a distancing between them.Anyway, i just thought I could provide some insight for better understanding.I am always asking the I-ching about my relationship with my companion.This time, I got Hex 54, line 4 - Hex 19. Hex 19 always comes up when I ask about our relationship. Could anyone offer an objective view of this reading, please?Thanks,Cipriana"
3315,What teel the IC me about the blinddate I'll have in November?I always have a bit a difficulty with hex 10. Tigers and tails..blinddate 10.1.4 > 20Would much appriciate insight of forumfellows!
3316,"This forum is really helping me to think (and stop thinking) about what to do with my life. Thank you everybody for your comments on my previous posts. I just have one more ""little"" question to complete my life overview... as I am still searching for guidance and direct myself towards fulfilled life. I asked to the I Ching ""what is my life's purpose"" because as I seat on my coach, in front of my laptop and learning so much, I feel I am not affecting this world at all.  I received 55.1.2.3 moving to 40. Would you please shed a light on this? Thank you so much in advance!"
3317,"..that's not my age hi ! just wanted to introduce myself to this little community and start with a reading to get the party going! I got 42 (Increase) when I asked whether I would pass a little upcoming audition.However, I'm new to I ching :bows: and I was puzzled by the whole changing lines thing..It looked like this ________________________ space  _____  ___  ________o_____  and this is supposed to be a box within the line :bag:(see attachment!!)  I think I ching is accurate so I'd be interested to learn what I can!Many thanks if you can help me understand these lines and also direct me to a good resource link? "
3318,"this is my first message on the forum (but i followed the discussions attentively )i'm not very advanced in I Ching interpretation ( not at all ) allthough quite enthusiast about it; i hope you help me in getting more insight i'm concerned about a relationship with a man i'm in love with (since a pretty long time ), we are not intimate yet and all the situation is very frustrating for memy question is : is it worth to keep being envolved with him , could i get something more satisfactory from this relation?i use my own coins and stalks - by hand (...i have the idea for me the method of yarrows stalks is more accurate because of my impulsivity  etc )and the answer was: by coins  17 (4 ) changing in 3                              by stalks  2 (1, 4) changing in 51what do you think about that ??? (...and excuse my english, i beg you:bows: )"
3319,"Having made my decision to go ahead with this I was confronted with another issue.My partner in this wants me to sign a contract.  Now, I don't usually work this way and I was a bit hesitant when I heard this.  Would the Yi tell me, ""It's OK.  Go for it"" or not?Why does she want me to sign a contract with her?54.4 to 19The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.A late marriage comes in due course.The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and allows the customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is no harm in this; she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly, finds the husband intended for her.Of course, 54 is about a feeling of powerlessness or truly being powerless.  Things are happening which you have no control over.Clearly, 54 in this case refers (I believe) to a feeling of insecurity on her part.  Things have taken longer than they should have (true) and she needs a bit of security.  However, everything will work out in the end.Again, I don't feel that the Yi is steering me away from this project or trying to warn me in any way.  19, the relating hex, is very positive.Your insight is much appreciated."
3320,"hi guys can you help me with this one?I asked how can I progress in this spiritual path i am on. I got hexagam 16, moving line 2, changed to hexagram 40.Can anyone give some clarity on this?thx in advance"
3321,"Hello friends,I hope you can help me (again) with this as I think I got it this time but would like to hear your views as well. As I have been making radical changes in my life during the past year (which made me very happy), sometimes I find myself in situations that are totally new to me, and I wonder if what I am doing is what I should be doing... if the direction of my life is what it should be or if I am somehow neglecting possibilities. As part of the changes I am doing -they have been done progressively, I also stopped going to church, which was my main source of social activity as I live in a foreign country and haven't done much friends yet, so I find myself being most of the time alone... Don't get me wrong with this, because I like it and I am also very happy for sharing my time -even when it's not too much- with people which I really want to share my time with, but, as I see the days passing, I started to wonder... is there anything I should be doing that I am not doing?So, I asked ""please give me an overview of my life"" and I received hexagram 15. Then, trying to understand better, I asked ""what is the current state of my life"" and received 49.2 to 43. I took from this as a perfect picture of what what's happening within myself, but still didn't see ""what to do ""with it, so I asked ""what should I do with this state"" and received 21 unchanging... so, I felt it as sticking into it, going all the way. Still confused about the situation, I asked ""what is this change about"" and I received 27.1. This response opened my eyes and I looked everywhere for an explanation about this, and I found that, for me, it was telling me that I have been neglecting something in myself, that I didn't see that something in myself and I was looking for it outside, so that it was this change about.... And that if I didn't do it this time, I might loose it - the magic tortoise... So I asked in the end, what is the magic tortoise referring to in this case? And I received 22, unchanging.Well, I feel I finally am onto something that could help me to direct this change I am feeling, but still is blurry. Will you be so kind to give me your views and help me to see it more clearly?Thank you!"
3322,"I am very grateful for the help I am receiving in this forum. Thank you again for your insight and advice. I have done a couple of new questions that I hope you can help me to clarify. I would love to be completely carefree when relating, but so far I am not, and I am trying to learn how to. Perhaps it is that I am so self-centered in regarding to ""feelings"" (meaning that I am so scared to be hurt or fooled) that I cannot see the other's feelings with clarity.I asked to the I Ching: how thinking of me makes him feel? and I received 12.6.; what are his intentions towards me (22.2.3) and what is the best attitude towards him (15.4). Is it possible for ou to explain these readings? Thank you in advance."
3323,"I have very big decision to make.  It could go either way.  It could be a total disaster or a fabulous opportunity. My gut has been telling me ""fabulous opportunity"" but my fear has been telling me the opposite.My question was worded thus: ""What do I need to know about doing this?""64.4.6 to 7Line 4:  Perseverance brings good fortune.Remorse disappears.Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country.For three years, great realms are rewarded.Now it is the time of struggle. The transition must be completed. We must make ourselves strong in resolution; this brings good fortune. All misgivings that might arise in such grave times of struggle must be silenced. It is a question of a fierce battle to break and to discipline the Devil's Country, the forces of decadence. But the struggle also has its reward. Now is the time to lay the foundations of power and mastery for the future.The Yi seems to be saying that my fears are without basis and that I must discard them if I am to succeed.  I believe that it's also saying that this could be a bit of a struggle.  However, I will win in the end.I do not see a warning here.Line 6:There is drinking of wineIn genuine confidence. No blame.But if one wets his head,He loses it, in truth.Before completion, at the dawning of the new time, friends foregather in an atmosphere of mutual trust, and the time of waiting is passed in conviviality. Since the new era is hard on the threshold, there is no blame in this. But one must be careful in all this to keep within proper bounds. If in his exuberance a man gets drunk, he forfeits the favorableness of the situation through his intemperance.I don't see this as a warning either except perhaps to caution me about getting carried away.  Overall, the message seems positive.  Everything will go well but I need to keep my wits about me.This is a VERY important venture for me.  Does anyone see a serious warning here?"
3324,"Hi, I am new to the I Ching and do not have very much experience in this, and I kindly ask you for help to understand what I am receiving. I am for a long time without a partner and my previous relationships have not been happy. I am seeing someone lately and I don't want to rush it, but I feel my feelings for him are growing. Maybe this is a stuid question, but well, I have been very cautious all the time and I feel I am not letting my feelings go naturally. I asked to the I Ching if I could let myself falling inlove with this guy and I received 17, with lines 4, 5 and 6 changing.

3326,"I have an idea of what my readings mean but I am very curious to hear multiple interpretations of the hexagrams as I think they stand up to subjectivity since I believe that subjectivity is a part of nature, which is what the i ching bases its insights on, and also I think it will help me gain a deeper understanding of the hexagrams. So please leave your input.I asked the very general question. ""What should I be focusing on now?"" since I my life feels very complicated right now.I got:44.1.6 to 43I read somewhere that 44 is not always negative, that opposites should meet sometimes, ""It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result"" from this linkhttp://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?l=Yijing&no=0but it seems like it is probably negative in my situation since the second hexagram is breaking through.Then I asked ""What is the best action to take in this focus to ensure a good outcome for everyone?""I asked this twice (not sure why) and first I got 21.1 to 51 and the second one was50.1 to 14Then I asked ""What situation should I bite/cut through?""3.1.3.6 to 53I think I will do a couple more readings on this topic but this is a lot to chew on for the moment.  Thanks for your help."
3327,"Will McCain win/become the next president?Hex 20.1,2 > 61The lines speak badly about McCain, a man with little idea of what the job entails or even how to do it, but even though the people are unsure what he is on about they will still support him anyway(sheep to the slaughter). The next line goes on to say that McCain has a very narrow view of the world and can only see things from his own point of view but unfortunately this will prove to be very dangerous in the future.Hex 61 He will influence the masses and the ignorant, and they will vote for him, he will beat Obama.

3329,"Hello All,I'm new to I Ching and a friend suggested I try it to help me solve a dilemma I have regarding my upcoming holiday. I've planned to spend about 1 1/2 weeks in Eastern Europe and then go to Italy for the last week. My original plan is to spend 1 night in Venice and 2 nights in Verona before meeting a friend in Sorrento. However, I'm considering skipping Venice and Verona and going straight to Sorrento. I've already booked my flight to Venice, hotels and the train to Naples, so if I change my plans I will be out some money. I currently live in Europe, but am moving back to the US right after this holiday, so going back to Italy will be more challenging in the future.Can anyone help me interpret the results of my questions? The first question is ""What would be the outcome of skipping Venice/Verona?"" I got 3.6 moving to 42.The second question is ""What would be the outcome if I go to Venice/Verona as planned?""

I am looking for a little insight of others to help me look at this response from the coins.Been through some big life changes lately, things are still changing.. I am in a bit of a holding pattern now, waiting patiently for insight to come.  Contacted one of my old spiritual teachers, was considering working with him for another six months.. the I Ching produced 63 with a changing line on top, changing to 37.I am new to I Ching but 63 seems to say ""Already Completed"".  This is true in some ways, but also I feel there is more to the story than this.  Even the place I'm living now, I can't stay here for much longer simply based on physical logistics.  A change is coming.Any insight into this sign?  Thank you."

3334,"I am several months into the development of a new business project. The person I have hired to manage this project is substantially older than myself; based in a different city; and, it seems, very well-connected in the general field we both share.When asking about this person, and the development of the relationship, I received Hexagram 20 with lines 1-5 moving. In the compulsive way people will, I later asked again (a few hours later) and again received Hexagram 20, this time with all lines moving.I've seen a few posts in the archive on the significance of an ""all lines"" reading and myself have only had it happen a few times in 15+ years of reading the I Ching. Once, several days into my first fast, I asked what the results would be of extending the practice (I had begun with the goal of seven days). I received Hexagram 49, all lines. In fact I stuck with the fast for 19 days total and in hindsight can safely say this action lead, if indirectly, to life changes so radical they still, in fact, surprise me.Anyway, I would value any insight into either the ""all moving lines"" anomaly or the applied meaning of Hexagram 20 with regard to relationships, since I've seldom received Hexagram 20 in reference to anything other than a question about myself & my own condition.Thanking everyone for their sagacity in advance..."

3338,"Background: I met this girl who is a friend of one of my roommates (who i don't get along with).  We hit it off and a week later we slept together.  A few days later she told me that she couldn't see me anymore because she's not looking for a relationship, she doesn't want things to be awkward with me, her and my roommate, etc.  Since then she has been sending me mixed signals but seems to only want a friendship.  I really like her and i've told her how I feel and she has said she likes me too, that i'm hot and the sex was great, and that feels the chemistry, but she hasn't changed her mind - and she doesn't want to be **** buddies. I think she might be scared or concerned about dating and/or a relationship for some reason?Question:  What is going to happen with me and E?Answer: 23 unchanging with ruling line 6My interpretation:  it seems like the splitting apart has already happened.  Line 6 if it was moving would lead to 2, the receptive, but its not moving.  I'm not sure what to make of the ruling line.  this hexagram seems to be telling me to just do nothing and accept the situation - which is more or less what i've been struggling to do.Question: I thought it might be good to inquire about where our relationship stands at this time.  So i asked.Answer: 26.3 ->41  Interpretation: I don't really know what to make of this.  The 26 seems to be saying restrain yourself, but line 3 seems to have a call to action about following others.  Perhaps just responding to E and seeing what happens.  Unfortunately, this leads to 41 - decrease.  That can't be good.So then, I ask, perhaps pushing my luck, What is the best relationship I can achieve with E?39.2 -> 48It seems to be saying I didn't do anything wrong or anything to create this obstruction.  And the fact that it leads to the well seems to be very good.  But 39.2 doesn't seem to show a way out of the obstruction.Any advice on this situation in light of the i ching readings?"

3340,"Hi,I was hoping your advice on these readings. Me and my brother have been working with accountants who have not been really helpful to us. They basically didn't guide us on what to do legally on contracts and proceeded anyway with what we were presenting, and later, after emails going back and forth, they told us that we needed to do some changes... which was basically what we originally thought we should do, but based on their advise, we kept on the wrong path for some time. Now we have arranged the situation, however, the problem starts when they sent us their bill and are charging us huge amounts for a service we didn't receive yet (they tried to charge us for work they will do next year!). We could change after discussing and they sent us a lower bill, which is still high, because they say they have work for us specific amount of time... The fact that last year they charged for their services around 400 euros, and this year they want to charge s for the same 1200 is already alarming. Also, the fact that they have been misleading us for some time and now they want to charge us for the time they spent misleading us tells me that they might have problems with money and want to get money from anywhere they can...Well, we don't trust them anymore, but we also sign some contracts before and don't know yet what is our situation, and as they are so tricky, we have some concerns about our situation.S, I asked the I Ching two questions:What should we do with them?6.1.2.4 moving to 42What's the best way of proceeding with them?30.2 moving to 14.Your help will be very much appreciated.Thanks!"

3342,"My question is: will I regret working for this person?61.1 tells me that it's really all inside me.  61.3 Tells me that the situation is always shifting, hot and cold, the guy is a little unbalanced.  He had a bad day, got into an argument on the phoen with a customer -- then tried to come start an argument with me!  one day I really don't want to be working for them, and can see no good coming of the situation, and then the next things are mild, and I realize i took the job because we really do need the money.  If I let this crazy man unbalance my inner emotions, I will regret working for him. But then 57 seems very encouraging."
3343,"Asking about job security, 15 is about modesty, doing what needs to be done, not making too much of it. I take it that I'm right not to push right now for raises, or point out how my contributions are solving problems.

I think maybe I'm struggling with the interpretation as it's such an important issue for me. Would anyone be able to take a quick look at the hexagrams I've got? I'd be very grateful.It's about a man who I've known for two years and in that two years we've grown incredibly close and are extremely compatible. I have a feeling he's my soulamte (and he's alluded the same) but there are considerable complications (aren't there always? ) We're very good friends but I'd like to take it further. Due to the complications and being extremely scared I haven't asked him if he feels the same ( I know he loves me as a friend)Anyway -  the first question I asked was:What would be the outcome if I pursue a sexual relationship with X? For that one I got 40 with 3 and 6 as moving linesThat becomes 50Second question was:What is the likelihood that we would have a long term relationship?I asked that as I don't want to mess up our firendship by just having a flingThe response I got was 19 with 1,3 and 6 moving.That becomes 18Third question was:What is the best course of action to take to ensure a good outcome?I got 52 with 2,4,5 and 6 moving.That becomes 28I also asked what the outcome would be if I made the first move. I got 8 with 2,4 and 6 moving which become 64.I'm so confused. Some of it seems really positive and some of it seems really negative  One the one hand I feel like I'm being advised to act and on the other to keep still.

3350,"Hi everyone,I need your insight for a reading concerns me the last days. It about a treatment I was suggested for a medical problem I have to take care. The doctor subscribed me some medicines that I’m not very positive on taking them. He said that even I don’t take them now soon I’ll. While I’m searching for alternative , no-chemical solutions, I asked Yi some questions. What if I take those pills ? 33.4,5 > 52.I read it as I should retreat from that idea and keep my individuality What it confuse me is that this might also be read as the medicine will make the symptoms go away and gain back my stability.I also asked “what if I don’t take them?” and got 5.2 >63 Line 2 maybe says that I’m in a quite difficult position ( sands is not a stable ground) and certainly there is a lot of talk but the result maybe be something positive. 63, already across is not easy to grasp. Maybe it says that I have already decide not to take them just I’m waiting to be more sure about my decision. And finally I asked which is the best remedy for my problem? and got 24.2 >19 Return to myself oversee my life and make adjustments? That makes sense !!!Any ideas ?Thanks,Maria"

3353,"Hello guys, Recently i've had some thoughts about whether should I play poker and how often. I've got some arguing with other people, because they think (and some small part of me thought about it too), that I might be too dedicated to poker and playing with the wrong emotions.The question i asked was: Should i play poker tonight? But I think that i ching gave an answer in general about the whole dilemma. Maybe you could help me to interpert it a bit deeper.Thank you "
3354,"Hi everyone,I asked the question ""Should I stay with my current partner"" and received 32 changing to 50. I was reading a bit about 32 and found a couple of interpretations - it either encourages a person to continue what they're doing or something about recurring patterns (honestly, this doesn't help me much with what direction I should take). I'm having a hard time getting my head around 50. Any thoughts about this reading? Also, in case it matters I've been with this person for five years and we live together.Thank you,Sue"
3355,"Greetings,I recently asked ""What is the best way to respond to a situation?"" I received Hexagram 3.6->42. Is this telling me that any response I make will fail?

3358,"Hello all, I have a friend who has been having some gynaecological problems  for the past two months. The doctor said that it's very possible that what she has is not too bad and that it will be okay in a couple of months.  Right now she's doing fine although she's experimenting delays in her normal period - however, irregularities were expected. The next doctor appointment is in two months. Anyway, ... She received this reading:what's her current health state? 46.5.6 > 57I can see that she's progressing, however I am not sure how to read line 6 here. what would be the best action in regards to the delay? 18.2 > 52 ... and could she be pregnant? 55.1.3 > 16 - I have the impression that she's not. Oh well, I didn't dare making any further suggestion here. Would you give us a hand on this? "
3359,"I'm starting to get a better sense of how to use the wisdom of Yi and am pleased to offer help to a friend through making a deeper enquiry on his behalf (with his permission).  He has had a persistent skin disease for a number of years and is feeling very burdened by it.  Nothing he's tried has healed it and Its caused him to shun romantic relationships, so he's been on his own for a long time.I asked Yi a number of questions to help him gain understanding of his situation:What is the deepest voice of his disease?56.4.6>15What is it there to teach him?47.1.2>17How does he heal himself of this affliction?1.4.6>5What about a relationship47.3.4.5>46I have the sense that the readings are showing him the heaviness of the situation and how his own thoughts have created this sense of oppression and confinment, but there also seems to be a sense of optimism and the greater workings of the universe on his behalf.As always, your wise counsel to help me gain better understanding of these readings is much appreciated."
3360,"Dear wise women & men,I asked: what do I need to know about pr & me? and got 3 with changing lines 2, 3, 4 and 5 > 34.To me it looks like an encouragement from the Yi to keep working toward my goal, to have patience. It looks like I will, despite the fact that things look quite the contrary now, have success and slowly move toward what I want between pr & myself.I can be wrong, so please let me know what you think about it...we don't want any wishful thinking here...Thanks :bows:"

I asked the I ching what my true path is and I got #30 (clinging/fire) with the first, second, third and fourth lines changing it to #4 (youthful folly).  Then I asked what would happen if I went back to the first guy and got #30 (clinging/fire) with the bottom and top lines changing it to #62 (attention to detail or preponderance of the small).  Then I asked what would happen if I went back to the second guy instead.  I got #30 (clinging/fire) with the third and top lines changing it to #51(the arousing/shock/thunder).

3365,"Hello all,I'll begin with the beginning. I've been thinking (romantically) of a guy for quite some time now. We live in different countries which make things more difficult. Last year, I asked the IC what will be teh outcome if I send him a message and I received 58.1> 47.I didn't understand it in the first place but later I had a ""ah ah moment""  . I talked about it in another thread (http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=4874).I'm still thinking about him , I know I shouldn't but I can't help myself  . I really like the guy. So, I asked the same question as last year :bag: and I received: Hex 51.1 > 16Ok. Hex 51 is Shake. 51.1 Karcher says : First you are frightened, then you are glad. The anxiety will bring blessing un the end. Let the shock move you the way is open.That is totally true. I'm frightened to write this email. I think I'm afraid of his reaction or his absence of reaction. Maybe I should go with it even if I'm scared because this will bring closure (one way or the other). But what does hex.16 mean in that case ?? Yesterday I casted the IC again and asked: what will be the outcome if I keep hoping for a romantic relationship between us?I received : 17.1.4.5 > 2Gosh..... hex. 17 : Following. 17.1 Leave what you usually do, go out into the world and mingle with others. The way is open. By stepping out of your usual place you will achieve something.Well actually this is what I'm doing...trying to meet other people. But I can't forget my guy .17.4: Following isn't hunting. If you follow only in order to capture a specific thing, the way will be closed. Locate yourself in the way and open your heart to the flow of spirits. Then you'll undrestand what to follow. Houw could that be a mistake? Your righteous sense of purpose is leading you astray. This could be a new beginning. Mmm I shouldn't try to meet some other people only to see if I can forget him? 17.5 : The way is open to you. Follow the connection. It leads on to excellence. No idea...Hex.2 I think is good omen, no?Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading me. :bows: I'd be happy to have your insights on those ones. Mousse"

He asked me out several times over the course of three days (we were at a conference), but I made excuses not to go all but one of the times when I created a situation where we went with 2 other people instead of alone. I know I sent mixed signals ranging from being interested in him to just being friendly and nice. I felt apprehensive for two reasons:1. because I was heartbroken for a long time over someone (whom I posted about a few weeks ago), but this man is the first one in a long time that has really gotten my interest.2. and while I don't work with him at all, he's closely associated with colleagues that I do work with from time to time and I was concerned how it would be perceived by them.I asked the IC, ""What will be the outcome if I send X an email?"" I got 47.4Then I asked, ""How will X respond if I send him an email?""

3385,"Dear all,Last year I had an very interesting divination, I would like to share with you.The question was ‘How will the real estate business do in the second half of 2007 in Taiwan?’The yarrow exhibited: hexagram 54, the moving line is lines 1 & 2, and the changeable position is position 6 = 55 – 9 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 8 – 8.___   ___   8 (the changeable position)___   ___   8_________ 7___   ___   8_________ 9_________ 9The above configuration suggests using the following rule to get the advice:Provided that there are two moving lines and neither of these two moving lines is at the changeable position, the divination advice mainly refers to the text of the original hexagram, and the significance presented by the image of the hexagram after these two lines have changed is possible be contained in the advice.The advice means:A) The text of the hexagram 54: it is ominous to undertake a venture; nothing favorable. This is the main advice and means that it is ominous to undertake aggressive action; no matter what is to be done, there is nothing favorable.B) After lines 1 & 2 change, the hexagram becomes Yu (hexagram 16); its image displays the signal of ‘foresight and precautionary action’, which is the additional message included in the advice. This advice proves the exact status later as the business has been declining up to now. What’s interesting is: If a further study is made on the text of lines 1 & 2, it can be found that both lines 1 & 2 are handicapped. They must collaborate and work hard (i.e. with double efforts); then they can move like an ordinary person. The property developer had indeed struggled with all possibilities in order to keep business still booming but failed to stop declining.The texts of line 1 & 2 are quoted for reference as follows:The text of line 1: Gui Mei is the concubine, crippled but able to walk; it is auspicious to undertake a venture.The text of line 2: One eye is blind but one still can see; it is advantageous to be persistent like the hermit.If you are interested in browsing more divination samples, please visit www.iching123.com.Best regardsTuck  :bows:"

I was not at all attracted to this man, we had, however, quite an interesting conversation and we were both open and honest and we left each other with a clear understanding that this was not to pursue.  So my question is; what was it that the Yi wanted to tell me? That there were obstacles to the attraction but how is 31 fitting in to the picture?Happy to hear what you think. In any case I feel good about the meeting cause it was an honest one and I feel I am getting closer to the 31ish thing...Thanks."

3393,"Hello again... thank you so much for answers on my previous post. I'm completely finding a lot of truth that wasn't seeing before.I've been making some questions to understand my own feelings now. So I asked... ""what should I do about this situation"" and received 61.1.2 to 20. I was reading a recent post from Maremaria that was quite enlightening on these lines. My conclusion was to look inside me and be honest, be true to myself and observe the situation. So the ""doing"" was quite reflective. Perfect for my current state of mind. So, I asked ""what are my real feelings towards him"". I received 33.5 to 56, it talks about a friendly retirement and its auspiciousness. I was perplex at first, but  I then I remember that in fact, this week I felt clearly not to look for getting together and also, I have to travel next week for about a week. which relieves me because I have two weeks a least to find out what's up with me.Then I asked, ""why do I feel this way about the situation"" and received 38.1.2 to 35.  For what I can see, it is telling me that I am giving space to the horse to come back - which I have been feeling I had to give time to the situation to develop by itself... like not making too much noise for some time. I need some more help on this if possible. I don't know how to apply line 2 based on my question.Last question was ""how should I deal with my feelings towards him?"". And received 46.3.4.5.6 (uh... so many lines) moving to 6. Well, I feel that the Yi says not to worry, go step by step, let them grow, feel them, make them real.if you have a moment, will you take a look and add anything you see?I just realized that there are here so many people helping out others in this forum, as well as sharing knowledge and spending time so passionately.

I have no clue what present to make but I know that I'd like it to be personal, in the sense that it shows that I've taken the time to think about it and to make a choice. Making presents can often be a delicate issue so I decided to ask the Yi how to decide what present to make in this particular ocassion. And the answer was Hex. 1.2,4 > 37.I have to admit that I got this answer yesterday evening and haven't had the time to really try to understand and to interpret the answer. I'll make some time later during the day to do this. It could be that I could glean something from the answer if I take parts of it literally (e.g. something that won't just be used once or twice but something that will endure in time? Just a thought). Or, perhaps the oracle is answering my question, i.e. ""how to decide..."" Or, even that the Yi is trying to tell me something else. So I'll have to think things through. In the meantime, I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter especially since I feel that some creative or innovative thinking re. interpretation may be called for in this situation.

3401,"Hello my dear friends... I hope you don't mind I share with you a dream I had this morning and a couple of questions I made afterwards to the I Ching.I'm going through a very powerful moment in my life, because I feel for the first time that every single thing that happen to me is an opportunity to learn and achieve internal peace. It's funny that when I believe I am almost achieving the peace in certain aspect, I have a dream that unsettles me again. As whatever I do lately is somehow unusual, I cannot relate to experience, and basically, I don't have a clue where I am heading to, however, I am starting to understand that this is exactly what life is about. Anyway... my dream goes as follows: as there are some renovations in the business location of this guy (in reality, this is the guy I am falling for) he needs to move temporarily to another location. Because of his renovations, I also need to move from my home - as it seems that I live in the same building than he has his business.  It seems that my mother lives with me in this dream, so we move to an apartment, that curiously, is above the temporary location of this guy business. While the original business location and home are more or less classy and ""old fashion"", this temporary locations are modern. My (and my mother's) home is a modern, spacious and relatively luxurious apartment. This guy comes to pick me up to show me where his new business is located, as I need to meet with him later. he's in a hurry and looks very busy.  He takes me down the elevator and we go to several corridors, too fast for me to take note of the way. However, I notice we are in the same building again, although this building is as big as a mall. When we arrive to his location, we agreed that I will be going later, as agreed. I leave thinking that I will be very happy when he's back to the regular place, because this temporary lace is too commercial.  I go back home and take a look to this new place, a bit estranged because it was really nice and ""cool"" and weird for a temporary place. I check the time and realize that I will be late and as, this guy and I have only two hours to meet, every minute I'm late is less time we have for being together. For some reason, I go outside the building to head to his business, instead of going through the same areas he showed me before (which in any case I cannot completely follow because he was going too fast). I realize that I am going on the wrong way quite soon, because ""our"" building is far away from me now, so I go back on my steps and after some struggle, I find his business. He is not very happy with me because I am very late and he has someone else to take care later and he cannot understand why I am late. I explained him that I have been very busy because I had to move as well - his business renovations also affected my home and I had to leave to another place also. He finally ""understands"" and says he says: ""Ah..."" -like if he finally understood what was going on.This is how the dream ends. And I woke up feeling quite unsettled. So, I asked the I Ching: What is this dream telling me? 12, line 5. Changing to 35.Am I just a ""job"" for him?38, line 1 changing to 64.Does he know what is happening to me in relation to us?37, no changing lines.If you had the patience to read the whole post  you can help me with this interpretations, can you? Thank you, thank you."

3404,"Hello.I'm still learnin' I Ching, so I try to ask as many different opinions I can have, to spot all those small things. So, I met one girl (she's in my learning course), and I did chit-chat, and I just wondered and asked I Ching a question:""How does our relations unfold?""So, I got 31.2.5 -> 32, was pretty shocked. Can't actually spot better combination on relations.. Still, the lines warn me, like second line ""He/she is capable of kicking or hurting your reputation, self esteem, or objectives. Approach with caution. Do not befriend this person until you fully understand his or her motives.""How to understand that all thing fully? Will it be fortunate? How do I approach her?"
3405,"Hi,This is an interesting one.  A friend of mine is having a serious operation soon and is worried that things mightn't go well and she might die. As a result she's putting lots of things in order and resolving her past.  I asked Yi, 'what will be the outcome of her operation?' and got 41 no changing lines.   I asked the same question a few months ago for another friend who'd gone into hospital following a rapid decline of cancer and got 41 with changing lines (can't remember which), all suggesting clearing the past and letting go, returning to the light.  This friend died 2 days after that reading.I'd like to believe that death for one doesn't mean death for the other and that 41 might just be saying that the operation is forcing my friend to confront her past and heal things, not necessarily that she will die.Wondered what you thought about this?"
3406,"Hi,I've recently applied for a contract and had to put in costings based on a set fee.  The fee is low for what I know will be a lot of work.  I could have reduced my fees to fit in with the number of days its likely to take but instead chose to cost it at my usual daily rate which reduced the number of days.  In other words, I'll get the job done in less time for my usual fee.  The industry I'm in is used to having you work hard for less cost and I was unwilling to accept this and reduce my value.I asked Yi, 'how will my tender be received?'  I got 51 no changing lines.I then asked 'what response can I expect from my tender?' and got 31 no changing lines.Two days ago, before I had completed the costings I asked 'what will be the outcome of my tender?' and got 39.1.3.6 changing to 42.I've not worked for a while as I've been trying to create a new direction for myself, so this job is a step back into the industry and though its not exactly what I want to do it would bring in some money which would enable me to get more done.I'm still waiting to hear back from the company and wondered what you thought.  Did I do the right thing by holding out for my set fee or have I blown it?I've also applied for some other work which is in an area completely new to me.  It would be less demanding and more fun and could introduce me to more interesting opportunities.  So I was surprised to get 33 retreat, when I asked Yi, 'what about this work?'I'm really ready to move forward and for my life to open up, so I'm surprised when it tells me to retreatYour good counsel is appreciated as alwaysMany thanksLast edited: Sep 9, 2008"
3407,"Hello,I am fascinated by this forum. Lots of information here and good readings for the soul. I am also looking for guidance using the I ching and I feel inspired to improve my life with it.I know I am not very original here as I have a relationship question. I have been single for too long now and would like to start relating again, for fun or for something more, but at least relating and enjoyign being a woman fully. I've noticed that I have some internal ""issues"" about this topic... I am actually terrified on this matter. I know I shouldn't and I know I have to open myself; this is an ongoing process for me and I believe I am improving. However, I feel clueless when relating as I have been reluctant of being emotionally intimate with men when they approached me in the past, but... I am ready to go for it. Anyway.... the case is that I normally don't see clearly when guys are interested in me, so I tend to doubt all the time... first I think... does he like me? then I think... yes, he does, a minute later, no, he doesn't, yes, he does, and so on... (by the way - my name is Daisy - lol). This happens with mostly all the situations - at least the situations where I am interested in the guy. Right now I have one of these panic attacks with a guy that I would like to have around... as a friend or something more if it goes well, but surely I like his company. But of course, I was struggling with what was going on with him and it is natural for me to think that I am doing something wrong to scare him out. Honestly, I ALWAYS think I am doing something wrong with guys, even when I might not. Anyway... Today I suddenly had one of those ""aha"" moments when, by reviewing my attitude as for me it was incomprehensible what was going on with him, and thought... ""maybe he IS sending mixed signals after all"". beyound this thought, the truly ""aha"" was that for the first time I stop thinking I was doing something wrong. I literally felt a heavy weight releasing from my mind and chest after this moment. Wel, to make this story short... I decided to cast the coins and make a few questions to see if I can move forward this situation of uncertainty. 1. Is he sending me mixed signals?19, line 4, moving to 54.My reading on this: he's not.2. Why I am so insecure about his intentions?57, line 3 moving to 59.My reading: because I am affraid. 3. Where is our relationship leading to?16, lines 2 and 3, moving to 32My reading: these two talks about timely action, aren't they? In one case, the right time seems to be obvious and nest line suggest that there is hesitation. Based on my questions... what does it mean?4. What do I need to know about ""him and me""55, line 5 moving to 49. My reading: it seems to be a good thing, isn't it?These are my attempts to read these answers. I would really appreciate if you take a look as well and clarify anything or add more insight (I'm quite unskilled with the I Ching). Many thanks!DaisyPS: I don't know if you needed the background information... this post becamse quite lenghty. Sorry. "

I have a new job, and I made a mistake today and work and everyone was really kind to me about it, but I was still worried. 12 Says to me this is a problem that just has to do with small commercial matters (true.) and moving line 4 says that people were just as understanding as they seemed.

We had nice time there and some talk afterwards, but thats all.Then, being a bit confused, I asked I-Ching 'does she love me?'  and I got hex 2 with no changing lines. Later I asked 'will we be together soon?' and I got hex 15 with no changing lines.Quite positive answers, so a month after our last meeting I asked her out again (we couldnt see each other earlier, because shortly after our last meeting she was gone to visit her family in other town, and later I went for a two weeks business trip). This time she said that she sees no point in meeting me again.So i figured out that I'll ask i-ching again about her love(maybe something has changed?). This time i got hex  55 no changing lines. Another very positive (am I wrong?) hexagram.So, the question is.... does she really love me but for some reason she just keep on boycotting my person, or was the oracle wrong?

3421,"hey everyone! new to this community but have been using the i ching since I was a teenager, slowly coming over the years to respect its ability to provide new perspective and insight - I'm sure I don't need to explain this to anyone! However, a reading I did last night has me stumped. I just spent much of the weekend with a colleague from work, someone I've been chatty and flirty with for months, and it all went a bit further. We're now back at work tho I haven't seen him. We clearly care for each other tho we're both not sure if a relationship is on the cards. I asked the I Ching for insight partly into what these new developments might mean, but mostly into how I felt about them and what I might need to do. In the past I've always been able to understand after thinking a little while about what the i Ching is trying to tell me, but this one has me stumped. I've thrown 1 - the Creative - into 13 - Fellowship. It's the 1 that's throwing me. it seems awfully abstract and powerful, both of which seem at odds with the slightly ambiguous nature of what (I thought) is going on. what is going on. Any thoughts?

3426,"Hi, Seems I'm asking lots of relationship questions at the moment.  This one's about relationships with friends.I've got lots of issues about getting commitment from friends and constantly being let down.  Its been going on for quite a while now.  There've been so many situations where I've arranged get together's with friends, tried to meet up and it never happens.  One friend, we talk all the time on the phone but she never makes an effort to meet with me, even just for coffee.  There's always an excuse why she can't make it yet I know she'll spend time with others.  Other friends always cancel at the last minute when I arrange things yet they'll show up at the drop of a hat a for other people.   I put myself out for them, go to their things but they won't give me the same loyalty and commitment.  I could go on and on about how many times I've been let down by friends over the last few years, yet its not always been this way.  I'm a very outgoing person, very sociable and people usually like me, so I don't know why this is happening.  I sometimes feel lacking in power and influence where others are concerned and deep down feel hurt by it.I asked Yi, 'why this difficulty getting commitment from friends?  It answered 34.4.5.6>9I also did the steps of change for 34 and got 11, 43 and 14.This feels very positive and suggests that things are changing but some insight from you would be great.

3430,"Hello,For a while now I've been thinking about moving abroad... Since it is a difficult dcision to make (to leave everything behind), I've been hesitating. This morning I asked the IC: ""what will be the situation if I move abroad?""I received hex.42.1.2.6 changing to hex. 29I think this reflects my hesitation and the fact that I think moving would be some kind of danger : I would move without knowing if I could find a new job over there; I would leave my friends and my life here.In Karcher's book, for hex. 29, the two last sentences are :"" A danger confronted is both an accomplishment and a defense. Now is the time to concentrate and take the risk"". Maybe the IC is telling me: stop hesitating and make a decision! Or is the IC telling me that moving is a huge risk and is too dangerous? I'm a bit lost.  What is your opinion about that? Thank you for your help  :bows:Mousse"
3431,"Dear All,Encouraged by the so gracefully (22) answered question by the IC and you on my readiness to be in a love relationship I dared to ask the IC if it shared my osteopaths opinion (who is working on a body vibration level) that 2008 is carrying great potentials for me to attract the right person with whom I could have this love relationship. The IC answered with hex 55 without moving lines. I get mixed feelings with 55, on one side it's a great hexagram to get and on the other hand it speaks about hardship. But my overall feeling is that it's a positive answer…so is the IC telling me yes….?Could you share your experience on this?Many thanks,Irma"

3435,"Hello,I am new to this forum, it was reccommended to me by a friend. English is not my language so forgive me any spelling errors.I have been single for quite a while now and I feel ready for a new relationship so I asked the I Ching: Am I ready to be in a love relationship and the answer was 22 with ml 5  & 6 moving to 63. I take this as a very positive answer confirming that I am indeed ready and the answer is even speaking about marriage! To me it looks like the IC is telling me that I already have met this person and the connection already there, however I can't think of someone I know that I could start to date. What do you think about this?Thanks a million.Irma"
3436,I've been talking a year now with a guy never met him.So I asked I ching if I'll ever meet him.I got Hexagram 42(increase)....Not changing.Is that a  yes or a no?why is it not changing?
3437,"Hello,I wanted to ask your opinion on this reading (you're always so helpful to me!). I've been having some changes in my life for the last year (from working as an employee to work by myself) and this has changed a bit my income - at least at the moment. I feel I am in the right way and that this is expected when one is starting (uncertainty on my current material gains). I'm feeling a bit worried though, and looking for ways to improve my current situation. I asked the I Ching about it, as ""what can I do to have material abundance""? and received 14.2.5.6 to 49. It seems quite appropriate answer for this type of question - although I would like to know how you see it. Also, what is my role in the business? (I'm in a business partnership) 1.2.3.4.6 to 3what do I need to do to make our business successful? 43.6 to 1I see all these readings are quite active and I feel the energy already flowing...

3441,"Hi everyone,I’m a little bit confused with a reading and I wonder if you could help me. There is a project assigned after a seminar I attend. Its not actually required but it’s an opportunity to test myself on it and use the guidance of some experts. Its not of vital importance this project for me, meaning that never though of working in this area. It’s about creative writing, which I like, but specialize on screenwriting for TV series. The idea I presented was welcome and considered as new and fresh and unusual for the “local market” but it needs a lot of work to implement it because of lack of technical skills. I haven’t decide yet what to do so I asked Yi for an advise. Q : what do I need to know about the screenwriting project.A. 61.1,2 > 2020, the way I perceive it here is to observe carefully around me and inside me , in a calm way in order to make a decision.  In line 1 and 2 amongst other things , I read about motives .What is not clear to me is line 61.1 W/b says : “If there are secret designs, it's disquieting”. . It talks about cooperation that might threat the outcome and create obstacles but I can’t  understand if this line is about secret relations I’ll form or that there are between other persons involved.Any help about the lines would be appreciated a lot ThanksMaria"
3442,I was wondering what the hexagram 8 says about intimacy between two people. Were they romantically ot physically intimatethoughts?
3443,"Hello all,I have a affair with a man for 2 months now. We saw each other a few times and I have no idea where we are going and what are his intentions (I know I could ask him about that ;-) ).

3444,I asked the i-ching: What do I need to know about doing my internship at school A? and got 8 to 20. Does that mean that I am too late in asking them about it and that I should look into why I want to do the internship there? Thanks for any advice:bows:
3445,"Currently I live far away from home, in an other country where I got married over 5 years ago. I've been trying to make this country my home, but I still can not get used to living here. I am homesick a lot and I wish I could move back closer to my home.(I wouldn't move back to my home country because of the political situation, one has no future living there) My husband doesn't want to move so I am staying here for him and keep hoping that one day I will find myself here and I will have a great job and everything is going to be perfect.I asked the Yi: What is the background of the situation? Why do I feel this way? I got: 4 2.3. 52  (I must not think I know my situation. how does 52 fit in? I don't see the answer clearly.)Also I asked for advice from the Yi about my situation.

3446,"Hello friends,I have a question for you in regards to this reading. Feeling some anxiety coming to me when thinking on not being able of doing something I really want to do during the following weeks for lack of current resources, I asked ""how do I need to deal with this my fear of not being able to do this?"" and received 25.2.3 changing to 1.My first impressions is that the Yi says that I should focus on the present - as per line 2. Line 3 talks about unexpected gains or loses. Being optimistic,  I would say that the Yi is telling me, not to worry, do what I need to do at the present moment because things will turn well, and that there might be something beyond my power that would help me. is this what you see or am I totally off?Thanks!Samgirl"
3447,"Part three in my current saga of examining every aspect of my life and trying to discern what might need a change, I drew the I Ching tonight asking whether staying in my current job would provide a foundation for doing the kind of work I know I need and want to do. See, I'm a foreigner in the country where I live, and I've made some compromises around my career in order to learn the skills I felt I needed to go forward. For the past year, I've been remarkably happy at a job in my chosen field, and am learning a lot of the skills I've desperately wanted to develop for years-- but the job is centered in an industry that completely goes against my core values. Though I don't do anything in my job to really further that industry (I'm a journalist writing for a trade publication), writing about it all the time is getting me down, and even makes me feel ""dirty"" at times.  I want to be engaged in issues that truly matter to me and help bring to light those issues, not ponder the financial solvability of an industry I find soulless. So, back to my question: I asked the Yi whether this job could nonetheless give me the core skills I need to become the fierce muckraker I want to become, and drew 36, Darkening of the Light, lines 1, 4, 5, 6, and changing to hexagram 33 (Retreat). Is this job turning me to the dark side? Is that what the Yi saying?  I say that only half-jokingly. Line 1 nearly bowled me over, since it seems to suggest I'd be better off starving than working a job at which I lose my honor. Retreat seems to suggest I quit my job immediately..Any insight would be appreciated. At this moment, I'm happy at the job and very much enjoy the people I work with, and was recently given quite a lot of new responsibilities, and am enjoying that too. Is this all a problem of form and substance? This would be my dream job if the topic were more in line with my values and interests.Thanks...ps-- follow-up question: ""Should I start looking for a new job as soon as possible?"" and received hexagram 2, lines 2, 4 and 6, changing to 64, Before Completion.Last edited: Aug 25, 2008"

3450,"So the blind date didn't work out and I'm taking things as they come, not looking to rush into anything, no desperate search for love, but I would like a relationship having been single for a while.  I asked Yi, 'What is the liklihood of a relationship by the end of this year?' Got 51.4>24.  Shake up and opening to the new sounds great, like someone could come into my life on a whirlwind and really excite me, but line 4 suggests it could be a fatal attraction, which scares me.  I'd like the real thing - commitment, stability, respect, love, friendship - not heartache.Would love to know what you think.Much appreciated."
3451,"Another relationship issue.I inadvertently sent an email to my ex-boyfriend, it was meant to go to a friend of the same name. I haven't been in touch with this ex for many years and hadn't particularly wanted to hear from him - it'd been a bad break up and ex behaved despicably.Ex replied excited to hear from me and wanting us to meet up.  I politely said ok in a reserved way but wasn't too excited about the prospect.  Haven't heard back from ex as he'd know by my tone that I'm changed, got my strength and self-esteem back and not willing to play into the old dysfunctional patterns again.I asked Yi, 'Why this renewed contact with ex?' got 35.4.5 changing to 20.I think Yi has confirmed my reservations but it would be great to hear what other people think.  Are angry ghosts and hungry memories (Karcher line 4) things within myself that I need to deal with, or is it about his decietful nature?  I do recognise of course that the outer reality is always reflecting something inside oneself.Thanks"

3453,"Hi,Could do with some feedback on a dating question.I had a first date with a man recently.  It was a blind date set up by a mutual friend (first time either of us have done this).  He's a nice guy but there didn't seem to be much connection between us.  He spent most of the time sharing his very strong opinions and didn't seem that interested in knowing more about me, or just lightening up and having fun.  At the end of the date he shook my hand, said goodbye and rushed off.  No nice to meet you or anything or checking that I'd get home safely.  I wasn't bothered as I didn't feel any big connection between us anyway but I would have been open to some phone conversations and maybe another date to get to know him a bit more and not make first impression judgements.  I'm not expecting to hear from him again.  There was also that old dating minefield of who pays.  I took the old fashioned route and let him pay for wine and a meal but sent a text after to say thanks.  Second date I might have offered to make a contribution and if the connections were still not working I would have been open to friendship - I have good male friends and generally have no problem getting on with men.Its been a while since I've dated and I'm only now ready to explore the possibility of a new relationship so I took this as a learning experience.  And I'm interested in knowing what was going on between us.  I asked Yi,  'What was the reason for disconnection between me and this man?  I got: 22.1.2.3.4 changing to 64.I'd appreciate any wise perceptive insights into the age old mystery of mars and venus connections.Thanks"

Then, I received hexagram 44, line 6. I am not sure what to make of this. I guess it means NO. But, the line talks about someone being aloof and being reproached for it.

3464,"Hi all.This is my second attempt at deciphering a time question, so please bear with me if I sound like a knuckleheaded newbie. I'm working off the reading and comparing the hex's to the big clock-like circle with the hexagrams around it. (See? I am a knuckledheaded newbie!)Here's the response I got to the question of when it was most likely that we would sell our house: 50:3,4,5--59.My instinct is to say that once we've fixed what's needed and established a realistic price (we plan to put the house on the market the second week of September), we could expect to sell the house by November. I also think the 50 is reminding me that more than a house is being sold here, which is true. Selling the house is the prelude to my divorce. Right now we are agreed that it would be simpler to sell the house before we procede with the legalities.Any thoughts?"

3468,"Having found a kind of serenity in my personal life (thanks again Willowfox), I decided today to focus on my own development, particularly as relates to creativity. I have always dabbled in the arts, singing, writing poetry and short stories, and even the classic-- attempting to write a novel just out of college, when you think you know everything about life but quickly discover you know virtually nothing. I've always felt my creative drive was somewhow stifled, as if I'm not letting it develop in a way I know would bring me happiness. Lately I've taken up the guitar, and last night I had a dream in which I was literally composing a song (I even remember some of the lyrics). In any case, I drew this morning, asking,""How can I unlock the creativity I've always felt inside me but have not been able to express fully until now?"" and drew hexagram 17, Following, lines 5 and 6. Changing to 21, Cutting Through (I seem do be drawing this one no matter what my question is these days, incidentally).With all the talk of sages and following, I feel the Yi is saying I need a mentor of some kind.

3469,"I am in the middle of a very long interviewing and ""wooing"" process with a job i want very much. For the past month and a half I have undergone several application processes and a couple of interviews (for the same job). I have been told I am one of the final candidates, but am awaiting a final interview with a panel discussion. The panel will consist of the main executives, some of the board, and the potential staff I will be leading should I get the job.The Yi has accompanied me through every part of this process with great results so far. The majority of the hx's have been in the nourishment category (5, 27, 50, 48) with a lot of interplay with 11, 12, 63, and 64. In other words, the answers have been very thematic and quite clear.However, I have been continuing the job search on the side ""just in case"". But I haven't bothered to ask yet about the general job search outside of this particular one I want. So to the question, ""In terms of my general job search, where should I be focusing my energy right now?"" I received 40.1.5.6 --> 10.And for the first time I totally have no clue what I am supposed to get from this. In some ways it seems as if it is referring to only the one particular job and not the search in general.

But my first line was transforming and tells me that the 'way is open' and success.

I did reask again because I assumed 37 was because I asked incorrectly:  Will I be a millionaire by age 30?  More specific and to the point, and not confusing to the IC, as it's a simple yes/no q.Apparently the IC is trying to tell me something, and I'm not getting it, two unchanging readings in a row(whereas 90+% of readings usually have at least 1 changing line) and usually I am too annoyed by the IC giving me answers I already know or telling me what I already know is most probable.  It's interesting when it throws in curve balls.My analysis of 37 was basically that it's up to me if I will be by age 30, depending on if I can stay focused enough between home and work life to accomplish my goal.My analysis of 22 was basically that even if I don't, I should still pretend I did, and keep working toward it.Obviously the IC thinks it's funny cause I was becoming bored with obvious answers from it and it presented me a challenge.  I arrived at my basic analysis' through studying at least 5 different interpretations of the IC.  :bows:"

Like they will believe me (up till now they haven't).Yesterday I got some paper and it scared me...the paper was not really significant but it remined me that the opposing party is really agressive, hence all my fear is back.So, tonight, when consulting Yi Jing, I asked whether the court will rule in my favour - I got 58.1->4747 again...this is going to be tough...but I feel again it is about my state of mind. Even the first line of 58 is about state of mind. But is the outcome good?4)Later I calmed down a bit and I asked how should I act/behave in this situation.I got: 38.1.2.4->23I guess I need to stick to my truth and not fight too much...what is mine will be given to me. 23 is falling appart...maybe the situation will fall appart and then finally be resolved...I don't know, can you help me? What do you see here? Thank you!"
3477,"Thanks for the reading on the house i wantedI got it i can move in next thursdayThe first cast i did it was very positive and willowfox got it right no need to worry you will get in.Thanks Trojan on the second reading as i think it was a warning not to be complacent, you could lose it 41 if you dont make it a real home is what i got in other words you could lose it as quick as you gain it inLike its only a six month lease and its like a trial periodCheers New things for SteveHow do I let someone know the reading was correct in the outcome other than this ?"
3478,"I am having a bit of a heavy time. Quite literal actually. My head and legs are heavy, my lower back aches in heaviness, no energy. I even postponed my daily tai chi because of to much weight. And I need a lot of strength to pull me through hard times. Sharing my insights on clarity is one of those responsabilities that seems heavy at this moment. I will explain later.So, I asked the Yi to give me an hexagram that would help me to understand and develop in this situation, but that also could be shared and worked out as a reading on clarity. I casted hex 30, Some interpreting titles are: radiance, attachment, clinging, responsability and, of course clarity. fire doubled, light doubled, middaughters doubled. A 9 on the first place and nine on the 6th place. As in the first line, all kinds of thoughts rushed through my head, all kinds of “things to do lists”. “Footprins run crisscross, if one is of serious intent, no blame”Indeed I am connecting to the 'outside  world' again, after a long period of retreat. And it feels as if everything is coming together. Things are so demanding that I hardly can find time to paint and write. firstly, I have to find new sources of income, else I can't paint and write at all. Art isn't making any income for me, on the contrary. I am thinking about giving therapies, but I have no social network to get a good start, and I am not good in networking and advertising myself. How I wish some mecanas (actually, my wife did, but that's not possible anymore)  would support me as an artist, but that is probably an illusion.Secondly,   my wife's shop for organic food is giving us a basic income, but competition from the big sellers is rising, and that is under pressure. Now her busyness partner left, and all the work is on her shoulders. I am taking over the administration (heavy) and other supporting tasks, but as a shopkeeper I am no good. It takes a lot of energy from both of us, feels like slaving, we are in a constant struggle to keep the good spirits.Thirdly, I am 54, very well educated, have many talents, am a gifted artist and a good therapist, but cannot get a place in society. Till now I could struggle on, in spite of all hardship and rejection (the Dutch can be very unkind and double hearted), but the energy seems to fade. It happens with people from 54.Fourth, I have a bad relation with my parents. Giving them my hearth means that they will start to hurt, not sharing heart means an empty relation. So with them I am in an emotional 'splits' . Now my father has had some open heart operations and a coma (see at www.bertdalmolen.com under painting “not dead”, the first image). Always thought that there needed to be a possibility to forgive, but good intentions are “screwed up” all the time. Try to say farewall, but somehow it still keeps pulling.Meanwhile we have, after our old cats died, two young cats.  That gives a responsibility/clinging/ for at least some 15 years. that are some aspects of the first line. I haven't been talking about my dreams, neither about interpretations and the relations to the YI yet.:bows:Last edited: Aug 1, 2008"

3481,"Hi friends, my roommate drama continues.  First she said she did not get a security deposit from me, which she did.  Then she asked me to provide her with a copy of the canceled check, which I did.Today she writes a note “This is Wrong!  We need to talk TONIGHT!”I don’t understand.  I think she is unstable and I’m kind of afraid of confronting her.I’m not sure how it’s unclear to her that I paid $400 in addition to the original rental agreement of $500.  Eventually she raised the rent to $600 and then to $700 which I am now paying.The check I gave her back in Jan of 2007 was for $900.  Aren’t I entitled to the remaining $400 even if the rent went up?I’m very confused and I just want to be prepared for when I have to discuss this with her.Nothing has been in writing.  She has been accepting and cashing my checks and everything has been a verbal agreement.It’s my understanding that without a contract she really cannot hold me to paying anything else.  I don’t even care about getting back the $400 but she’s also asking me to pay on top of that for utilities she says I owe.  I asked the yi “what should I do about the deposit conflict”The reading I received was Hex 60.2 to hex 3Hex 60 is about self-imposed limitation and restraintt.  I’m trying to figure out what the restraint should be.  I also read this about 60:“Severe and difficult restrictions should not be allowed to continue because they produce exhaustion.”Yes, I'm exhausted! I can stand firm and tell her I’m not giving her any more money, but will that cause even more problems for me for the next  2 ½ weeks?  I’m not sure I understand the advice in Line 2.  either.Change in the second place means:Not going out of the gate and the courtyardBrings misfortune.I’m thinking it just means to NOT diverge from my understanding of what that money was for…and to NOT back down to her bullying and possible threats.    Or should I offer to pay an additional $200 since my rent is now $700.  That just doesn't seem right to me.Any advice?"

3484,"Well, I don't like to think I'm obsessing excessively , but after feeling a continued sense of unease and fear around my troubled relationship following the first question I posted here: http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=6306and deciding to go away for just a couple of days to attempt to ground myself, I drew again this morning concerning my long-term partnership. Here were my results: Q: ""Given the current dynamics of the situation, what would be the best approach to take at this time?""A: 33, Retreat, no changing lines. This seemed pretty clear-- withdraw for now. But I found this confusing considering that the YI seemed to have been encouraging me to stay close to my partner and strive for intimacy in my first reading, which drew 31 unchanging. So I asked a second question:""I do yearn to be with her-- would it be unwise to go back tonight? (I had planned to stay away for at least a couple more days)""Answer: 21, Cutting Through, changing to 10, Treading (Conduct). Lines 2 and 5 changing in 21. The Yi now seems to be counseling that I establish firm boundaries and even ""punish"" her, which seems to so radically contradict what I had seen the first time I drew. I have to admit I am very angry with her for vacillating about what she wants and I feel she takes my love for granted. In this sense, part of me does feel like drawing a line. On the other hand, I know that she is deeply confused and I want to be there for her and not run away at the first signs of a crisis. My original intention in going away for a couple of days was to ground myself and find a way to accept the ambiguity of the situation so I could work toward that deeper intimacy counseled by 31. Please help as I don't want to further damage a relationship that I still hope can be salvaged. Thank you for any wisdom you can impart."
3485,"Hello,I am checking this forum very often... it is great! I hope you can help me to understand this reading. I have asked the I Ching what were my possibilities to have a relationship within two months and received 63, with line 3 and 6 changing. I might be seeing the wrong thing, because it seems to me that the book is talking to me like if I already had a relationship. Am I seeing wrong? Thank you in advance for your hep!Siren"
3486,"I've ended up in the middle of some drama lately, and ended up being shunned because of it. Basicly I ended up calling people out on their crap, for lack of a better term. A friend of mine ended up getting sexually assaulted at a party she went to with a guy she was interested in. The guy she was interested in  passed out, her other friend left and the guy who owned the place it happened at sexually assaulted her. So now the story is that I am spreading horrible lies about this guy, who claimed it was consentual.The other rumour was about 2 other people I know, a male friend and another female friend who is engaged to another man. The two of them made out in a bar after the rest of our friends left. Now the story is that I am spreading rumours that they are sleeping together. There are other small rumours in there as well, but those are the major ones. I consulted the I Ching, and it gave me Hexagram 28, unchanging. ""Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary. The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times: the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though it stands alone, and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains undaunted even if it must renounce the world."" Seems pretty self explanitory. I know that what I was saying was true, and if they don't believe it, I shouldn't doubt myself, but stand firm in my assertations. I've done a few readings and it always says the same thing and that the truth will come out eventually. So I asked the Iching ""How will the truth come out?""And it gave me 41.5>61 Change in the fifth place means:Someone does indeed increase him.Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.Supreme good fortune.The fifth line, divided, shows parties adding to the stores of its subject ten pairs of tortoise shells, and accepting no refusal. There will be great good fortune.The great good fortune attached to the fifth line, divided, is due to the blessing from above.From what I gather here fortune will be on my side in this. I am wondering what the line about ""someone does indeed increase him"" means. Does that mean someone else will support what I said? The resulting hexagram 61, inner truth, does that mean the truth will come out, or just that I know the truth inside myself and that's all that matters?"
3487,"Im considering making an offer on house tonight, or first thing tomorrow morning.  I consulted the iching for wisdom on this big move, and of the amount of my offer.  I received 9 changing to 41.Opinions and insight on this outcome would be MUCH appreciated at this moment!Thank you..."
3488,"Hi,There are a couple of readings that I'd appreciate clarification with as to what course the Yi is encouraging me to take.Firstly, there are a group of people who I am aquainted with but unsure of - basically I distrust them although individually I like them, there is often a sense arrogance - perhaps it's the tribal mentality ( I am not a 'fully fledged member of their group' although set to live with some pople that are...)  I have always felt on the periphery of groups - which I think is better - the Yi often comments on the negative aspects of grouping and factionalism! but I find myself often feeling timid and acting out of character around them, like I need to prove my worth when I speak to them (I know it's my problem - there is a quote : 'People can only make you feel inferior if you let them'..)All this wouldn't matter so much, but as I will be living with a couple of people from that group, I know that I will continue to encounter them in the future, and I'm tired of the paranoia they make me feel as I would like to just get on with them, so I asked what do these guys (they are males) think of me?48. 3 - 29(I have received the well before when asking why I sense that certain people don't like me - perhaps they can't see my worth because of some weak or needy vibe I emit?)I then asked what hexagram represents my life?17.2 - 58(17.2 worried me ' He surrounds himself either with good or bad company... throws himself away on unworthy friends...') Is the Yi warning me here about those I am set to live with or just generally? At the moment I feel I can trust them, and we get on, but they are also a part of the above mentioned group in which I wasn't accepted.... this is my worry about the living situation because it could mean mixing more with people I don't think particularly like/ respect me..so I asked should I live with them?39.3,4 - 45Does this mean I am headed for danger or that they are the 'trustworthy companions' of line 4??Thanks a lot "
3489,"i asked what would happen if i continued on the same ""relationship path"" that i am on.

3490,"So, I went out on sunday, with the new guy and met his kids who were very sweet and it's going great! He asked if he could call when he returned from holiday next week (they went last night) He texted me a couple of times yesyerday too! Really sweet stuff!So I'm feeling hopeful and consult the oracle asking 'How will my relationship with ... change when he returns?' I recieved Hexagram 29 lines 2/4/6, changing to 12!!!I'm a bit shocked at this answer, am I correct in 29 being about danger? I've read it as a kind of dark night of the soul situation, about mastering demons and there being a difficult situation looming. The lines seem to say a really testing situation is on the way and it has to be faced bit by bit (2) that wise moves need to be executed (4) but then it says something about a really serious past error needs to be addressed and it will take three years to put right (6) or am I utterly misreading?So then I asked what role am I now playing in .... life? I recieved 7 lines 1/2/3/6 changing to 22, this is about an inner battle unless I am mistaken? and 22 is about attraction on the physical I think?Be grateful for helpxxx"
3491,"I would like some further insight into 6 unchanging if anyone would like to give it. It would be much appreciated.I was asking a series of questions...can't remember exactly how it went but asked a question about a friendship, along the lines of what does X really mean to me (I Think) and I got 18.4. I didn't understand if it was talking about my childhood, things occuring in the friendship or what so I asked for clarification..I got 37 unchanging...series more questions...what is the best way to fix the decay or along those lines ..can't remember exactly or what should I do maybe..anyway I got 5.4,5 and on the other question I got 26.2,3,5 . They were questions trying to figure out what the weakness or decay was..Then I finally asked what I needed to fix within me..or I needed to fix.. because those answers said about fixing a cart while waiting. I can't remember exact wording (if I said within me but pretty sure). It was in line with whatever happened in my past with my family that I was allowing to cause decay in my life now,what did I need to fix in me..and I got 6 unchanging. I am confused a little bit. Is it conflict with myself or how I deal with conflict? I am thinking how I deal with conflict but where does 18.4 play into that? Could it be both, conflict with myself and how I percieve myself and thus how I deal with conflict?Any insights would be much appreciate. You all are so insightful and bright.

3492,"Hello everyone,I'm excited to be joining this community as I've been leaning on this site a lot through a very difficult time with my long-term partner, and I've learned a lot more about the Yi in the process. My partner and I have been together for eight years, six of which we've lived together. In my mind, this is a marriage. This year, though, we've plunged into our first major crisis, mostly because my partner says she has been having doubts about our future, feels cagey on account of us meeting so young (she has never been with anyone else in any serious way), having sexual curiosity and sometimes doubting her feelings for me as of late. This has been devastating as I'm still very much in love, and our relationship started out on an extremely passionate, mutual level and has continued that way for many years. Since she told me this, I have been going through a major upheaval inside, and decided to rent a separate  apartment  for a couple of months to give me some space from the situation and help her clarify what she wants-- recommit or go off and be single?. The problem is that I've only ""succeeded"" in staying at the other place twice, because every time I try to be firm and say I need us to be more or less separate until the situation is clarified, she begs me to stay and says that even though she's currently confused, she knows we can work through this and that all couples go through this. So I stay, but a few days later I hit rock-bottom again, afraid that I'm too vulnerable in this situation, even though she's being very sweet and attentive.Which brings me to my reading this morning. I asked the YI whether it was wrong of me to give in to her insistence that I stay last night, though I was really upset and felt a strong need to remove myself from the madness. I drew 31, Wooing, with no moving lines. Any suggestions as to what this may be trying to convey to me?I've also repeatedly drawn hexagram 24, Return, and Opposition, particularly lines 1, 5 and 6. Thank you for any help in figuring out what I need to do to take care of myself in this confusing situation."
3493,"I have been working on understanding how these two hexagrams relate to each other in a given situation, on questions like ""what do I want with this"" or ""what my intentions are with this"". (44.2.5 to 56)44 is all over the place in the forum, I know. But certainly I see little in regards on moving to 56. Believe me, I am not lazy and I am studying in order to do my readings fully by my own  yet I seem to be stuck here. I would appreciate your insight - the explanation on how 44 and 56 relate to each other. Thank you!"
3494,"Wow.  So I'm having major conflict with my current housemate.  I have told her I'm moving and she is now being VERY nasty and verbally abusive to me through note-writing.  She has called me a ""selfish bi***"" and other things that are not so nice.I gave her the standard 30-days notice but she thinks I have wronged her because I gave notice on the 7th and not the 1st.    I realize many people give notice on the 1st but I did not think I HAD to give notice on the 1st.I feel so tense going to the house.  I have not seen her since she started leaving the nasty notes but I have nowhere else to go and I will eventually have to see her.  I asked the Yi what should I do?I received 52.3 moving to  23Keeping the back unmoving so that one no longer feels one’s body, and walking out into the courtyard without noticing the people there brings no blame. I suppose I just need to continue to take the moral high ground and avoid her.  52 seems to say keep my distance and stay centered. I am not at all good with confrontation. I wonder if I should try to find a friend to stay with for the next 3 weeks.   Does anyone have any advice about line 3?  It refers to sexual desire which really doesn't make a lot of sense in regards to my situation???I know in my heart I have done nothing wrong.    But she is mad at me and also her sister is mad at me too.My heart is heavy even though I did what I had to do because it was a toxic living situation for me."
3495,"I have been consulting the I Ching, off and on again, for about twenty-five years. Until this post, I have only ever told one other person that I consult The Oracle.Although I had not consulted the I Ching in well over a year, events recently transpired to cause me to seek out it’s wisdom and advice, once again, as follows:         I received an unexpected invitation to my 40th High School Reunion, earlier this summer, and it triggered a premonition about my possibly being contacted by my “old high school flame”.I have asked a series of questions, and cast the coins, regarding my premonition, and have received some rather startling answers from The Oracle. The answers I received are so startling (At least to me.), I have been contemplating sharing them with someone.Today, I asked the following question of The Oracle, and cast the coins:“Should I, as the superior man, post this (Initial’s of Old Flame) contact sequence on the I Ching website?”The answer I received was:Hexagram 50 – Ting, with changing lines 2, 4, and 6, changing into Hexagram 15 - ModestyI interpret this answer to be an affirmative, but with warnings, and have decided to begin sharing both my questions to, and my answers from, the I Ching concerning this event in my life.Gary, a.k.a.

No I'm sure like the Bible this book is not the source of all authority and knowledge in the universe (even despite the concept of divination supposedly being this) thus it can be taken with a grain of salt. But I'd thought I'd ask since I was thinking of how offensively different we are from everything else thriving on this planet. Not sure what it's saying here. But fire under the earth seems to signify a close relationship. Of course that's a literal interpretation. Maybe it's saying we crashed here a gazillion years ago and forgot everything and had to grow up as members of this planet? line 1: Seems to talk about how humans are the weird bird on the block. I don't like how the others are viewed as ""dark powers"" like in the traditional interpretation. Although it does hint at a fallen angel kind of deal. Hm... Although my question was only about the species not our souls. I don't want to think of us as worthy of gossip, or as the earth as our enemy and perhaps the animals gossip about us. Line 5: Talks again about how humans are stuck here and have to act like we are members of this situation by acting and not by genuine connection. Strange it also mentions being put in bondage which I know is at least one conspiracy theory creation story. That the Anunaki (God and Nephelim of Bible)  bred us as slaves and then regretted the whole deal - that we are genetically modified organism. Like author Loyd Pie says. This line certainly supports that. It mentions being stuck in a situation. A ugly ugly fate. :bag:39 - Ugh another dark hexagram. Difficulties and obstructions.  Seems as though we are stuck here with great problems. And have to fix our problems before we can escape this situation. Eek looking at this it seems we were forced here and are not members of this planet. This explains our problems - after all if we were from here why would we want to destroy it and build these artificial realities around us to shelter us from the natives? Sooo... thought that would be an interesting throw to try. Suffice to say the result isn't encouraging. Thought it is supported by all i've heard. As the sages say - human beings are unable to ever reach balance with nature unless extraordinary measures are taken.I find this all a big bring down. Seems pointless to follow the Tao and try to ""improve oneself"" if we are doomed and damaged from the outset. What a conundrum."

Which seems to say that, men need to be more sensitive, and not be so dominating - AKA Dominator male. Well i've been sort of cultivating my non-competitive side. And trying to take on the advice of the Taoist teachings (TaoTeChing) And I don't need to point it out at how pitiful my dating record is. just look at this thread:http://www.onlineClarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=6154So I asked the Yijing two questions.I've grown up often hearing from feminist women and others that dominator behavior is bad So i've tried to not be a dominant type (in order to be more attractive), I have also been worried about the Tao Te Chings teaching to ""not compete"". Any advice on this?7 ---7 --- 8 - -8 - -8 - -7 --- Increase (Be the dominator?)Has all my resistance to being the ""alpha male"" been the one reason why I can't have any success with women?6 - - --- 8 - - - - 7 --- ---7 --- ---8 - - - - 7 --- ---Hexagram 55 -> 30I'm hoping not to offend anyone on their views if they are reading this. But I was just curious to see what others had to say about this.Increase seems to point to me to mean that I need to ""go get em"". Be the Alpha male. #1 and all that dogshit.So just to clarify I asked it again. And got 55 -> 30The second reading defiantly talks about being the ""big Kahuna"" but in a negative standpoint to the extent of it being excessive and super arrogant. Possible interpretations:1) Your attitude of non-competition is very isolating. Your seeing clearly now. 2) By being the Alpha male you will be isolating yourself. (doesn't hold up to reality) 3) Generic warning about excessively trying to be the master. Ya'll have any ideas on how to understand these readings? thanks in advance.Last edited: Jul 28, 2008"

3508,"Hi I'm new to this forum, and new to the I-Ching. I took interest in it a while back after watching a documentary about the Mayan Calendar and the I-Ching. I was amazed at its accuracy and how people today still use it with incredible accuracy.I was so glad to find this forum. I've been reading older posts to try to understand some of the readings I've been getting, and its helped somewhat, but I'm hoping to get some input on interpretations from the members here that will be more specific to my situation.I was involved with this man, undoubtedly immature and a few majors issues, but I guess sometimes we can't help who we fall in love with. After a few months of seeng eachother, I discovered he was being deceiptful, and I broke it off. Over the next few months, he kept contacting me every 2 of weeks telling me how much he missed me, how he kicked himself for ruining things, and how he thought of me every day. But every time I responded, I would get no reponse back, which hurt and made me feel that he was being gamey. But I never made first contact. This went on for about 3 months, when he finally responded in a big way...telling me all the things had said before, only this time he told me that he was in trouble and would be going to jail for a while but when he got out he wanted to make a new start with me, that I had been something good in his life.I've consulted the I-Ching several times, but there are a few readings that I don't understand how to interpret. If I could get your opinions on what you think it could mean, it would mean a lot to me. I hope I type these correctly from what I've picked up from here so far.1. What does X feel about me?  17.1.3 > 312. What will happen between he and I?  20.4 >123. What are X's plans regarding he and I?  21.3 >304. What can I expect regarding X persuing a relationship with me?  33.2 > 44The very first casting I did I asked if X was planning on contacting me again, and I got 51, but I didn't keep that paper and can't remember if there were any changing lines, all in all, I've gotten alot of 51's and 17's with other questions.Thank you all so much for any help you can give me."

3511,"I'm sorry but I have a very central pertinent question that could radically change my life. I know I have a billion hexagrams to read, but this one is something pretty important i think gets to the root of the issue.I was thinking today and realized that perhaps i've been doing something to an excessive degree. I've had this realization many times in the past many months. And have been on this path for a long time (perhaps years).I see how there is a subtle contradiction in all this by this very posting. Which is the idea of slaying the ego, or diminishing the ego. I do it so I can fit easier into the circumstances. But it has I think hit a degree that is very dangerous.Please over look my speech as hyperbole is not a effort to be egotistical.

Attempts to reorder one's self are shown to lack perseverance. No matter how hard one tries relief does not come.Thats what it feels like. At times. Like I'm trapped in this and can't escape. Line 1:""Activating one's will through stimulation, beneficial. Great advantage. No harm in this"" [Move upwards]Thats also what it feels like. At times. It feels supreme and energetic. In fact If I don't feel the energy I consider that a reason to try to decrease my ego.Release tension... etc. It seems to have a duality in the answer. The hexagram is Increase but my question involves a notion of decrease.Hexagram 8 Just the title seems to say just by the titleHold yourself togather. So I should stop trying to slay the ego?

3512,"Greetings!So I went for dinner with the man I didn't realise was attracted to me. It went well. He took me to a lovely restaurant and we got on very well and I think he at least finds me attractive! Today he invited me to join him and his two kids for a picnic, this coming Sunday (my daughter will be with her dad till monday or tuesday) I would like to see him again, but really feel it is best to play it cool! I let him kiss me on both cheeks last night but that was ALL!!!So I told him I might have an appointment, but I would let him know by friday! He was quite honest last night and told me he was nervous about taking me out and had been waiting for me to return his call etc!I don't want to mess this up and a friend compared our birthcharts and said there was strong attraction, but in relationships he was a bit of a hunter and really liked the chase and I musn't under any circs give in to easily to him.I consulted the Yi asking 'What role do I now play in .... life?' I recieved Hexagram 6 lines2/3/4/5/6 changing to 15!Now, obviousely this is about conflict and then it is all beautiful and gentle!!Does this mean, my playing hard to get is causing him conflict? Or is it having the opposite affect to what I desire for the eventual outcome?Pleas. please help and give input!Thank Youxxxx"

3514,"Hi there. I've picked up the I Ching after a very long hiatus and am delighted to rediscover its wisdom and usefulness. I've turned to quite a few of the readings on this site to aid my understanding and am impressed by this forum, so thanks to Hilary for establishing it, and thanks to all of you for contributing.So ... there is a line of I Ching questioning I've done that troubles me. It has to do with my son, who's only five years old, and I'm quite sure I lack objectivity where he's concerned. In brief, a few months ago I looked at his astrological chart, and I was very surprised to see what appears to be the chart of a leader of some kind of group, but possibly a very ... unusual group--I dunno, a punk rock band? A group of renegade fighters? A computer company that is somehow mixed up in dark stuff? To me this sounds kind of crazy, and it certainly is the kind of stuff that is worlds apart from what I am involved in, so I am just not sure.I hadn't thought about that in a while, but tonight I asked the I Ching, ""What kind of adult will my son be?"" I received this answer:13 Fellowship with Menlines 4, 5, and 6 movingbecomes36 Darkening of the LightThis reading reminded me of the astrological chart. I might also mention that these are not hexagrams I normally receive for readings regarding my own circumstances.I also asked, as a follow-up, ""What of this idea that my son might be leading something? What is the nature of what he will be leading?""I received: 51 Shock, with line 6 movingbecomes21 Biting ThroughOf course my son's fate and karma are his own, and I cannot control his destiny; I can only help him to develop himself to grow up prepared to meet that destiny. But I am his mother, and these images and ideas disturb me. Am I overreacting? I would be interested in knowing what any of you might think about the nature of these hexagrams and what they might mean to you in light of asking about a child's future.Thanks very much,Angela"
3515,"Hello  friends, I wanted your opinion on the following: I have been waiting for long time to get together with a group of people but there is something going on at the same time that might require that I cancel... I don't know when I will be able to meet with this people again and I don't know what to do.I asked the Yi and got these answers:1. what should I do about my meeting? 2.2.6 to 42. what if I cancel? 64.6 to 403. what if I just leave everything as is (not canceling and just see)? 10.3.5 to 14For me, clear as mud.  ...

3516,"This is my first post to the forum, I've been a lurker as I consume and digest what I can and when I can.  It's very slow work as the meal is very rich and diverse with a feast of nuances to savor.This year I experienced the trials and tribulations of Hexagram 47, and think I have come through the 'other side', and am now moving forward with my life plans.  There are some circumstances surrounding me that are coming emerging, beyond my control, which threaten to 'steal' [steal is probably not the correct description here as much as divert could be easily used but I see it as a theft so use the word steal]  my attention and time away from what I really want, and feel is the best for me to be doing at this moment of time.So seeking the best advice I could think of I consulted the I Ching the following:Q1: Is there anything I should know about my immediate situation?    22.1.6 Making Beautiful > 15 IntegrityQ2: What to be aware of? 32.3.4 Persevering > 7 The ArmyThe next day - repeated images/words Unite.  Upon revisiting the Integrity reading  music was playing in the background and the female singing the song had a chorus with words containing 'Unite'. Hilary has stated in her writings that: ""The core of the Chinese word for 'humility' or 'integrity' is uniting, in the sense not of merging into one, but of holding two things closely together.""Sensing that The Mystery was trying to tell me something of great importance (over and over and over - sometimes I can be quite dim) and just not seeing my 'nose so clearly on my face' I asked the following:Q: Please advise on some vitally important role it seems I am playing.16, Enthusiasm - no moving linesI think I have a pretty good idea of the meaning here.  And I am dreading that the outcome will require me to unite the [seemingly] conflicting circumstances with enthusiasm and grace/humility without being swept away by one or the other.  I feel as though my capacity for balancing these two circumstances is at odds with my constitution and abilities to cope with the juggling act that will be required in the near future. Or am I make a mountain out of a mole hill?But would like more perspective, some times the forest is difficult to see due to all the trees.I will appreciate hearing [reading] what anyone else has to say about these readings.ThanksZoe"
3517,"Hello,I would love your opinion about the readings I've been doing in relation to a meeting with a friend  that have been postponed a few times. We would normally meet once a week but for some reason, this month we have only met once so far, due to his availability. After a week of  were supposed to meet last week on Tuesday, but he called to cancel because of a working situation that demanded his time, so he rescheduled for Friday (today). Today her secretary called me to cancel because he got a little sick and had to go to the doctor. We have reschedule for next Wednesday. This is an unusual situation between us and I have two different feelings about it: one is that ""oh well, this is how it is..., we just are not supposed to meet these days"". At the same time, each time we had to reschedule -even when I was disappointed- it was appropriate as it helped to my own schedule. However, I am also a bit afraid of him trying to avoid me for some reason... and the thought has been following all day. So I asked the I Ching a few questions and got repeatedly hex. 32. 1 - why he has moved our appointed from last Tuesday to Friday, and not earlier? (I asked this on Tuesday after the call)Hex. 32.2.5.6 to 332. Is he laying to me? (I got very insecure and even I know it is not good to ask ""yes/no"" questions, I couldn't help it...)Hex. 47.3.5 to 323. why he is canceling our appointments lately (asked today after the second cancellation)Hex. 32.2.4 to 15I need your help with this reading because I am not understanding what they are telling me, although I recognize that there is a strong message delivered by the I Ching as Hex 32 is being all around. I trust in this friend and I know he has a lot of things going on and he has also being very gentle and apologizing for the cancellations, but I cannot avoid feeling a bit paranoid...  Please help.Sotrix"
3518,"Hi!I've been invited out by a man I know vaguely. He is divorced and a father of two. He invited me in a birthday card he gave me and made a point of saying he'd like to meet me with or without my daughter, whatever I was comfortable with. Yesterday by chance he met my daughter when we were amongst the same large group having coffee. He made an effort talking to her and later texted me suggesting we met up with him and his kids when they come to stay with him next week. I feel it's better to get to know him a little first before we bring all the children into the situation. especially since I don't want to introduce someone into my childs life only for them to dissappear again.I am quite confused about him as I had no idea he liked me.I was quite badly hurt a while back by a man and this has left me wary but I am not sure if he is all he seems. I asked the Yi  'Please tell me clearly what his motive is in asking me out?I recieved Hexagram 15 lines 3/5/6 changing to Hexagram 20This seems positive in some ways and a bit scary in others.Then I asked 'Please tell me clearly what he ultimately wants from me?'I recieved Hexagram 44 lines 1/2/3/4/5/6 changing to 24.There seems to be so many conflicting messages and opinions in this. Does it mean that his intentions are not honourable and he only wants to sleep with me?

3522,I currently rent a house that the owners want to sell.I have tried to be cooperative with them but they just keep getting more pushy with their demands.They have disrupted my life for the past month and it looks like i have another month to put up with it. Phone calls at work pestering me and several times a week having to leave early from work or something to unlock something for them. or let people in the house A property management place is supposed to be handling things but these owners just think they can come over whenever they feel like it. They really are supposed to give advanced notice but lately they just call the day before and tell me they are coming  and not bothering to ask.  I asked out of my lease and they said no as they need the money.It got so bad with the phone calls today I called the property manager and asked her to talk to them to quit pestering me. They had the nerve to ask me to take off work so they could send people over to photograph the house.I asked the yi what I should do about the owners of the houseI got 6.2.5Line 2 seems to say to back down from the conflict as I won't win against themLine 5 seems to say get a third party involved.I have another house to move to and I can have it a month early but I really don't want to pay double rent for a month. I asked the yi about just moving out early and being done with itI got 22.3 to 27Line 3 seems to say it would be a good idea
3523,"Hello!I am conscious that someone I care about is attracted to me mainly because of superficial reasons and is unable to penentrate and embrace the qualities I have within on a deeper level, despite a year of learning about each other (hope this makes sense). A does tend to tell me that i am intelligent and kind and caring etc and all the rest, but tells me I am beautiful much more. I probably read like a spoilt ungrateful woman that can never be pleased! Yes, it's lovely but the thought of being loved for appearance is an empty feeling and not permanent.  Beauty doesnt last forever, solid bonds need something more substantial to last. I think my mind and heart is far superior and enriching than what is on the surface, although what is on the surface is striking too to many others. This is frustrating but I am guilty for feeding this by taking pride in my appearance.   I tend to enjoy making an effort with my appearance I asked IC what is x's view of me, I received 22. unchanging.I think then my judgement on A was correct.I then asked what action would be needed to bring our relationship to a deeper level i.e  marraige! I received 22.6. > 36Would IC be trying to tell me to darken my light, be plain and simple, forgo makeup and frills, get out the flats and the frumpy attire and hide my attactiveness?or maybe it is saying I dont need to do anything at all, but to try and deepen the relationship would mean my light inside would be darkened because i'd just be a surface beauty and nothing else?!Maybe I can chop off my nose to spite my face...?!"

However, she's currently in this on and off relationship with this other guy and, as a result, I can't help but be disappointed. I'm aware that it may be a selfish notion but it's been so long since I've felt anything like this and to let it go seems so undesirable.

3529,"I have some aspects of my health which are not good, from my point of view.  They are not of the type that would kill me and they are not even particularly noticeable to people who don't know me very well, but they diminish the quality of my life and my appreciation of and joy in life.  I spend some time in meditation and at times pray.  At times I have prayed to be healed--or I have asked if it is possible for me to be healed--but with no observable result or answer at this time.  At times in the last 2 years, I have asked by the i ching if praying to be healed does any good, or if that is something that accomplishes nothing and God or the universe ignores it.  I have asked the question in somewhat different ways.  For the most part, the answers have suggested to me that it is good to so pray.(Obviously, I could ""give up"" praying in this way and ""accept"" that I will have these health problems for the rest of my life.)Here is the answer of today's reading, Sunday, July 20th, 2008:When I pray to be healed, does that accomplish anything? 32. Hêng / Duration above Chên The Arousing, Thunder  below Sun The Gentle, Wind The JudgementDuration. Success. No blame.Perseverance furthers.It furthers one to have somewhere to go.The ImageThunder and wind: the image of Duration.Thus the superior man stands firmAnd does not change his direction.with changing line 3: Change in the third place means:He who does not give duration to his characterMeets with disgrace.Persistent humiliation. and relating hexagram:40. Hsieh / Deliverance***In this case, the judgment and image of 32 seem to suggest continuation of my praying for healing.  The changing line 3 also seems to suggest that not continuing would be a mistake, at least in the Wilhelm translation.  In this case, as in many others, I read both the Wilhelm translation and the Legge translation.  The Legge translation seems to give an opposite implication:""However firm he may be, there will be ground for regret.""  Although the Wilhelm and Legge translations for line 3 seem to have opposite implications, I am taking this reading as encouraging me to continue to pray for healing.This reading is one of about 10 in the last 2 years on this same subject."

Here's the situation - I've been attracted to someone in a higher position than me at work for almost two years. Some of you may have helped me sort this out in previous posts. The tension/attraction dynamic between us has been ""noticed"" by other coworkers, etc. BUT two weeks ago, he found out I was 7 years older, and now I sense he is distancing himself from me. Now the talk is about our age difference and I sense he has distanced himself from me as a result. I am devastated and am in my cave trying to sort it all out while understanding there is learning here. From my limited vantage point, I read 49.3 as the point of confusion, which is where I am right now.As W/B puts it - ""When talk of change has come to one's ears 3X, ...he will believe.But then 49.4 gives me hope that we will rise from the occasion better for knowing the truth (my age) from the situation and 49.5 ""the great man changes like a tiger/even before he questions the oracle/he will be believed"".Does this mean the truth will set me free? Karcher says of this line that it is a time of great abundance. Lastly - I would welcome feedback on the resulting Hex 24 Inner Truth. Of course, I would like us to be able to transcend the age factor and live happily ever after."

I am scared of surgery of course but I suspect it will be warranted as either a ligament or cartilage must have been torn from all the symptoms (clicking, instability, pain etc)"
3534,"On my I Ching blog, I made this post a few days ago. I'm sharing with the community to get some additional insight....--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Relationships, nos. 6, 7With respect to relationships, there is an interesting line in the text of hexagram #7 in Wing's version of the I Ching:""A more philosophical perspective can do wonders at this time, whereas a focus on the more eccentric aspects of your relationships can lead you astray.""So, I asked the oracle: What is the proper ""philosophical perspective"" I should have on relationships?The answer I received was hexagram #6, CONFLICT. This answer matches my feelings of disillusionment about relationships. I made a note underneath the hexagram which encapsulates my current feeling:""Relationships eventuate conflict.""I suppose there's no way around this axiom. It has proven itself true, time and again, in my personal relationships. It reminds me of Sartre's claim that ""Hell is other people."" So, I'm trying to find this ""philosophical perspective"" on relationships, this perspective that offers hope of freeing me from my disillusionment and isolation and of finding the kind of relationship intimacy I desire."

3537,I've been so depressed lately for weeks.i asked the yiWhy am I so depressed?Answer38.2 to 21I am thinking this means I am not living my own life and I need to bite through opposition. But I really don't know what that could be?

I am following sessions  of Taoist massage where I am learning a lot, however, I was feeling that I still need to do something in order to get the most of it. Thus, my question was: ""what do I need to do in order to get the most of my sessions? The response was 43.3.5. to 54.For what I understand, the Yi is telling me that (42.3) I need to be myself and find my uniqueness, regardless what others might think. And 43.5 tells me that -even when I see old habits coming back, I should keep my course. Now... the change to 54, I don't understand it.Could you please give me a hand with this? Thank you,Samgirl"

3541,"I asked the yi about an encounter I had last night with my friend.  It was very confusing.  It made me think this guy is a little not right in the head.  It’s obvious he’s trying to stay in my orbit but cannot for the life of him do it in a direct way, which is very frustrating.   He’s gotten in to the pattern of pulling me toward him and then pushing me away.  The details of the encounter are too many but my assessment of last night is that he devised a plan to see me and then when he did see me he got too flustered to follow through with his plan (to give me a ride home).I prefer to not take the lead in this situation and pursue him because he’s already pushed me away once when I attempted this.  He grew up in a dysfunctional alcoholic family.  He’s told me he’s afraid of women and that when he likes someone he runs away from them.  I also come from a dysfunctional alcoholic family and I see lots of red flags here.  I’m drawn to him but I don’t want to get in to a co-dependent relationship so I’m pulling out.  Anyway, I asked the yi “what did he want from me last night”?I received Hex 1 with moving lines 1,2 & 6 changing to Hex 31 “wooing”.Hex 1 is the yang, masculine force.  I’m wondering if he’s looking for me to be the leader here, or if he’s trying to be the leader and isn’t very good at it…or is he just trying to get creative with his “wooing” process since he’s afraid of doing it in a direct way.  I’m never sure how to make a story out of so many moving lines.Does anybody have any thoughts?Last edited: Jul 16, 2008"
3542,"I am not a very high energy person although I am social and I have a lot of friends.But usually my energy level is not very high and I tend to drift toward laziness and even lethargy.

And what would 13 as friendship suggest? I have good friends, not too many, but some of big quality. I don't understand the message...could someone help clear it up for me, please?Thank you!"
3543,"Hello every one,I asked a very simple down to earth question and got a quite complex answer which is confusing to me. I asked the Yi what it thought about the idea of me going to someone for a relooking (meaning these places you can go to for getting advices on the best way to get your hair cut, the colours that suits you best, how to dress to bring out your qualities, best make up for you etc.) And the answer was 10 with moving lines 1, 2 and 5 becoming 8.From some interpretations the answer looks like a yes, it's a good idea and in some other interpretations it's more looking like a no, there are dangers everywhere! The question is quite superficial and while I am person who have spent my life looking inwards I was thinking that for once I will look outside! Do I risk stepping on the Tigers tail if I stick my head outside? Shall I only work on the inside? Myself I feel it's a good idea to go for a relook because when things refuse to change on the outside despite my hard work on my inside I could as well try to change the outside by some outside action. What do you think?Thank you very much."
3544,"Hi,I asked one of those general (heartfelt) questions (with no one I know at the moment in mind):'How can I draw the love of another to me?' I received 44.1 Coming to Meet changing to 1 The CreativePut me in mind of a post on here, with the question How do I meet my destiny/ life partner!Initially the combination of hexagrams seemed odd - as I didn't have anyone particularly in mind - but maybe it's saying that in order for someone to be attracted to me I need to be strong and stable in myself first? or predictive - I will meet someone soon which will turn into something positive and strong?What do you think?Thanks :bows:Last edited: Jul 15, 2008"

3546,"I've seen that 44 is a hot topic on Shared Divinations and I've been readig and learnign a lot from those posts. I've intrigued with this combination, as it seems to me they are somehow sharing the same topic (44 and 31) but from totally different approaches. With novel (and roughly) attempts to understand them, I see that the ""temptation"" from 44 is hold on (44.2), risking humiliation although without fault (44.6). The change to 31, does it say that this leads to real influence? I see that 44 talks about this force that goes blindly towards all yang lines while 31 is the natural influence that does not require induction. What are your thoughts about this?"
3547,"Hi,I'm applying for a job by tender an asked Yi  how will it work out.  I got 45.6>2.  Hex is very positive but Stephen Karcher, line 6 says, You are paying for this connection with sighs, tears and sorrows.  It is not your fault.  You are surrounded by the wrong people.  I'm not sure if its advising me that i will get the job but it will encounter difficulty from other people, or if I shouldn't bother putting in the tender.All advice appreciatedThanks"
3548,"Hi,Second one I'm posting today, hope that's ok.Anyway, you'll see from previous post I got a reprieve on my rent from my very lovely understanding landlord.  Its due end next week and I really don't want to let him down and he's put so much trust in me.  Although I'm looking for work it'll take a while for me to find a job so I'm still in the same postion of needing money to pay my rent and not knowing where it'll come from.I asked Yi, what about money to pay my rent next week?  I got 44.2.6>49, hidden Hex is 1.  I can see from past posts that there's lots of uncertainty around Hex 44.  I use Stephen Karcher who seems to have a different take on it than Wilhelm who is quoted on past threads (will need to get Wilhelm so I'm in sync with what most of you are saying).  Karcher says:A time to welcome what comes to you.  Acting through the woman and the yin brings invigorating strength.  Welcome what comes.  Do not try to impose your will.  This is a time of meetings, brief, intense encounters, that involve universal forces.  Do not try to control things directly, but realise what happens to you  reflects the union of these powers.  Great things are moving in these events.  The spirit spreads throughout the world.  You are coupled with a creative force. It brings unexpected encounters, lucky coincidences and enjoyable happenings. Do not try to hold on to things.  These contacts will come and go.  When Heaven and Earth meet, all the beings join in a brief radiant display.  The time of welcoming and coupling is truly great.2: A womb preganant with coming abundance.  Do not be or accept  a guest.6: You are making an encounter into a trial of strength.  Become aware of it and turn back to the way.  Then you will be without fault.Can anyone give me an insight into what this is telling me?ThanksMuch appreciatedLast edited: Jul 12, 2008"
3549,"I have been a bit unsure about my living prospects/ housemates next year though I am relatively confident about it all now and kind of excited! I am going to be living with 3 others who you could say are a more concecrated group/ firmer friends, and I have been a bit worried that I will feel like an outsider (although that may be my nature anyway which ain't neccessarily a bad thing I don't think!  Anyway I asked:Will it be good?64.1,2,5 Before Completion - 25 InnocenceNow I feel pretty sure of the interpretation - 64 saying you cannot now tell whether you will get on or not - time is ever evolving? (Fitting as it is the final hexagram - suggesting the circularity of life?)Then Innocence speaks of going with the flow basically doesn't it? and respecting those around you.. ie my friends who are good people and I shouldn't be so suspicious?  Also not trying to second guess things which cannot have a definitive yes or no/ positive or negative answer?  I guess 25 could be viewed as very positive? saying that there is no need for great action now, either to encourage a particular movement or oppose it, just go with the flow - you are on the right course and there is no need to think about it - just let it take you along - ie there is no big crisis to act on here?Does 64 Before completion suggest also that my relationships with these people are at the early stages and will develop to closer friendship/ the prospective group dynamic can only be revealed in time?Thanks,I think I'm pretty clear on the message given here but if anyone has any thoughts to chip in as always I'd be very appreciative :bows:"
3550,"Hi allI really needed some clarity on the circus situation so I asked 3 questions today.  Without going into details, myself and the ex met about a week and a half ago.  Lots of things were said, including him saying that he didn't know what he was doing, he's a mess and the long-term potential he saw in us was how well we got on day-to-day.  He also has regrets about some choices he made while in the relationship.  I was just left very sad after it.  Acceptance is coming in fits and starts, but I can't shake the belief in us.  My reading where Jesed mapped out the calendrical time for that question is still ongoing, and that is pointing to a transitory situation that will be ending at the end of July.  So here is what I asked today:What impact did our last meeting have on X? 3 unchangingOk so the meeting caused him difficulty and confusion (Eh, sorry about that Mr X ).   He admitted to being confused anyway so I agree that this reflects his somewhat chaotic state of mind.  What impact did our last meeting have on me and X's relationship? 45 unchangingThis has me a little stumped because the way it is now is that I really can't be around him because I feel too much for him.  I told him at our last meeting that every time we meet and we get on so well is just a reminder to me of how compatible we are, and that nothing could convince me that we couldn't have made it.  So I said that meeting is too painful because we're not together, so I feel that I need to limit our contact now.  Yet this suggests a gathering together.  I don't understand how what transpired at our last meeting could have the effect of any gathering together, yet it sounds to my hopeful heart that there is an air of regrouping and gathering together again.  Any perspective on this would be really helpful because I'm not sure I can see this for what it is.So, finally, on that note of my belief and conviction, I asked the iChing 'I still have belief in a future relationship with X.  Please tell me something I need to know about this belief'.  39.3 -> 8Well my interpretation is that my belief is obstructed.  Wilhelm talks about a retreat, but the retreat is in preparation for overcoming the obstructions.  It also talks about unswerving inner purpose bringing good fortune in the end.  39.3 validates this for me, I think it's saying that it's not the time to persist with furthering this belief, but giving up on it would be a mistake, just retreat for now.  The relating hexagram about union again suggests groups of people coming together for a united purpose.  However the Wilhelm translation also mentions about inquiring again, which I haven't done yet.  My intuition is to unravel these readings a little first.  I might try inquiring again tomorrow.So, what on earth is all that about  ?!!  What with the dynamic of it being a transitory situation, there being an obstacle but to perservere, and then the theme of group interaction and coming together.  By the way, my calendrical reading suggested unexpected visitors - 3 of them.Thanks in advance for any perspectiveApplegirl  "
3551,"I understand this hex reading has been addressed here before, but I want to share my question with you all, anyway.The school year for us will begin a month from now, and I want to get my head on straight about it because in my heart I would like to be closer to my brother in california, but without the cooperation of my soon-to-be-ex, that's out. This is weighing on my mind because we will be soon visiting my brother, mostly because our daughter is crazy about him.So I asked, ""What is the reality of staying in X for this coming school year?"" Got 61.2,6--3. The difficult beginnings must reflect the changing form of our family because we have been here already for three years. And the contradicting lines! Could it be that this works well for our daughter, but not as well for us?7.1,3,5,6-->9 What is my part in this reality?8.3,4-->31 What is my daughter's part?28.2,5-->62 What is R's part?The ""not associating"" line 3 on hex 8 has me stumped. What on earth? I need a fresh eyes here because the reason we're hanging together is for her benefit. And she's too young to demand that she not see one of her parents; besides, she adores us both.Anyone want to take a crack at these?The Yi (and my own observation) clearly says her dad is not ready for such a big move, but neither is his situation at work a good fit for him. So he's stuck, and until he's unstuck, I'm stuck. Which, considering my penchant for enthusiastically jumping into new situations, could be a good thing for all of us. Any wisdom would be welcome!"

3555,"So, I'm just finishing my master thesis and have decided to further pursue research on calligraphy. My financial status does not allow me big gestures but I have found an organization that funds research projects in Japan so i was thinking of applying to go and start calligraphy classes there. In the meantime I am trying to forge alliances with institutions here in Europe (the Netherlands, UK or Germany) so as to get accepted in their funded research programs. I asked the I-ching ""How should I proceed in order to attract good fortune and support with regard to my endeavors"" and got 63.1 to 39. It sounds very ominous to me but deep down i have almost made my decision. Calligraphy has had its charm on me ever since I started playing around with letters and I feel that this is my chance to bring it in my life in a major way, but the I ching seems to be negative about it . .

3557,"There is a guy I know who I felt I had an immediate connection with - ease in communication (which is fairly rare for me) able to be myself with him and things in common.  There was a brief romance which fell through because he wasn't over his ex etc but we remained friends, I didn't want to lose someone who I was able to talk to!Anyway didn't see him for a while, then recently came back into proximity with him - and I asked about a week ago - what will become of my move here - and got 13 Fellowship with men to 44 Coming to meet.  That came true as we spoke quite intimately again etc, although as I was at a low ebb and I was less articulate and confident and not as comfortable with him as before which may have changed things..  Anyway he has now left and is going travelling etc and said we should meet up when back.Now I don't think there's a proper romantic attraction here, I feel I moved on from those ideas a while ago, but I keep thinking about him now which is annoying and I think it's because I would like to retain contact with him as he's interesting and I want to keep the connection alive, but I'm not sure if I was at my best last time we spoke and that perhaps he's not that bothered, as I fear I may have said some dull things due to recent 'brain fog', and that maybe the friendship means more to me than it does to him.So I asked a phew q's;What will become of this relationship:32.4,5 Duration to 48 The well This seems encouraging but I don't really understand the meaning of the Well applied to relationships?Since he's left I have also sent a couple of messages and maybe have come across now as too eager, and perhaps he thinks I'm reading more into the friendship.  He replied to one but not to another which makes me think perhaps he doesn't want to encourage it, so I asked:What was his response to the messages?53.6 Gradual progress to 39 ObstructionIs this saying he is keeping a reserve and is not too enthusiastic about retaining communications or that he is physically obstructed and can't reply at the mo?I then asked were the messages too much/ have I put him off in some way?5.1 Waiting to 48 The wellWhich speaks for itself with regards to perhaps needing more patience for a reply but again not sure about The well?Finally, I asked my worst thought: Has he has lost interest in me/ in hindsight realised that he doesn't particularly want me as a friend (in light of our last encounter though we talked a lot I was not quite myself and was perhaps a bit difficult and too honest about certain things) and got:40.4,5,6 Delieverance to 59 Dispersion(Less encouraging)What do you think?I hope it isn't a case of we have learnt all we can from eachother and the friendship has nowhere further to go? I think I'm probably over thinking this - but I'd be intereseted to hear interpretations of my answers - especially The Well as it came up a couple of times...Thanks"

I had friends who at some point gave up because it is so much work to go into all the different translations/commentaries and so often it takes time that we might not be able to offer. The discussions going on here make up for all the missing joints. It got me into thinking though if perhaps I am being lazy and untrue by relying more on other people's study rather than doing my own homework.

I feel stagnating.Now, I have been thinking a change for a while, but always thought situation might change, I could go on with doing my job properly despite the others, I should be satisfied with the money, etc. Now I'm offerd another job which would include: creative, stimulating, fast-paced work, cooperating with interesting, new (very important) people in the field which doesn't allow any kind of routine.

Now this brings up the new hexagram 22 which is pretty good. My question is what am I to make of this presentation of 24 (Return) with 3 and especially 6?Thanx!"
3567,"So while I'm going through a difficult time (which I ususally refer to as 'the circus' because there have been lots of huge upheavels in the past 6 months, not just the rship) I already got clarity on the current situation with my ex, but as I mentioned this whole time has brought up huge questions for me.  This morning I explained to the iChing that I'm a little worried about myself (you can only go for so long being upset every day, panicking about the future, all that kind of stuff) and I asked what I can do to help myself.  So the answer is 2, unchanging.I interpret this as having to address the feminine more.  I've been trying to 'do' lots to try and negotiate this time, been trying to deconstruct, reconstruct, analyse, fight and be brave and independent which I guess are all yang in energy.  I think this hexagram is telling me to bring in the yin side of myself to balance things up more.The funny thing is that my last rship had started to bring that home to me in a very profound way.  The ways in which I started growing in the rship were very much around my identity as a woman as opposed to a person, if that makes sense.  It did introduce me to aspects of myself I didn't know were present to the extent they were.Where I'm a little stuck on this today is the implementation of the advice.  In one of my last readings I asked the iChing to tell me something of myself, and I got 46 - pushing upward.  Again, I see this aspect of my nature as being quite yang.  How do I harmonise pushing upward and the striving and searching that I associate that with, with the wholly yin aspect of 2, being receptive, following, accepting, yielding?  I must admit that it is against my nature not to be striving for something, so I don't want to 'mood make' that I'm somehow this gentle, accepting girlie when I'm quite a feisty lady  .  Yet I get the sense of needing to develop the feminine in a balanced way.As always, any of your insights would be very much appreciated.Applegirl "
3568,"Hi again All! I asked earlier about contacting a friend and I got 2 different responses. I became confused so I kept asking questions different ways. I am having alot of trouble learning to read this or adapt it to my situation. Anyway I did go ahead and call my friend, they didn't answer (given the time that doesn't mean anything). He hasn't called back yet either but again given his personality that doesn't mean much either.   So the lowdown is I am the one that said the mean hateful things and we weren't friends anymore. I came back and apologized sorta but at that time my apology didn't seem to be accepted. I didn't make sure there was any understanding of what was being said and all interaction during this disagreement took place online.  The point is I have been reading through these forums and people's suggestions to others on what questions to ask so I decided to try a different approach and asked ""Where mine and my friend's friendship was at now?"" It answered 1.5>14 . I have been getting alot of resulting 14s in my questions about my friendship with this person and some primary 14sso I asked ""Why I was getting so many 14s"" and the answer was 50.1,6>34Does this mean anything to anybody? I asked other questions but I have such a hard time figuring out the answer..I keep asking in hopes I will understand eventually lolI want to thank Steve and Twilight for answering my last post. Thanks so much for taking the time to read and answer Last edited: Jul 6, 2008"

3572,"Hello everybody,I just joined this wonderful site and I am very happy for what we can learn from this forum... I have been reading the postings about this line of Hex 54 and found it quite interesting, starting with Hilary's comments:Receiving Hexagram 54 often reflects a very insecure, frustrating situation. But although this is change you didn't ask for and can't control, it could still be bringing you something of value. 'Marriage' can also mean finding your own place and fulfilling your destiny. The moving lines will show where you find yourself in this new situation: if line 5 is among them, then great things can grow from here.My question for the reading was: what happens to me in regards to X. The line says: The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.The embroidered garments of the princessWere not as gorgeousAs those of the servingmaid.The moon that is nearly fullBrings good fortune.I understand that is about being humble, finding the joy in the place we are in. Finding contentment because we accept the situation -which is out of our control.Any input about how to interpret this line? Merci beaucoup!Sotrix"
3573,"Hi guys, I'm back!I've been doing meditation and feeling pretty good lately.  I've realized that the depressed feeling I've been having came from the rejection of the present...not living in the ""now"" so to speak.

The performance went well and we had a nice encounter.I asked the yi ""how did he feel about seeing me tonight?""I got 30 unchanging.There seem to be mixed feelings about 30.

3574,"One of the several significant changes in my life is how I'll be making an income for myself. I will not return to teaching at a public institution next school year, and because I'm divorcing, I can't return to the stay-at-home mom role either. So I'm exploring new opportunities for income. I need flexibility and I need to be my own boss (and florescent lighting drives me bonkers), so I won't work well in yet another institutional type setting. I've been discussing one avenue with an EFT practitioner/instructor--she'd like to have another EFT practitioner/instructor for consults and she believes the job may be a good fit for me. I like the idea, too, and I've been kicking it around for a few weeks. I like this work because it's very portable and it appeals to my empathic and communication skills. And, of course, because I'd be my own boss.  Some training opportunities are coming up this summer and I'm consider what to do about them. Today I asked the Yi what she thinks. ""What can I expect if I pursue a EFT practice as a source of income?"" 54.3,4-->11Is this a ""better late than never"" message? I get a strong feeling that it will be a worthy secondary source of income and valuable to myself and others as healing tool. Ultimately good for everyone.Did I read this correctly?"

3579,"Hello,Firstly - when a line is moving does it mean that the meaning of the line is more emphasised and relevant to your situation, or less of an aspect relating to your question as the line is moving away from its meaning to something else in another hex?Secondly I have a bad habit of ""divining"" and I don't mean the I-ching - I constantly torment myself by looking for certain signs and signals usually to confirm my worst thoughts/ fears or if I'm undecided about a course of action.  It's stripping me of my individuality - I constantly doubt my whims actions inclinations thoughts even! And look for outside 'signs' that I'm 'the right track'.I often do it for yes and no anwers which i ridiculous! The common sense part of me know that a) there are positive and negative aspects to most situations and b) it is very arbitrary and I disrespect myself - undermine my years of accumulated knowledge on this planet - living a sort of toss a coin existence from a weak sense of self and conviction! I know it's v unhealthy, but usually the 'signs' I choose confirm my thoughts (usually bad) and I can't help but wonder maybe I am being 'guided' or maybe I just subconsiously pick up on the signs before I see them and they just happen to reiterate anxious or deluded thoughts because I ask...I got 9 'preponderance of the small' unchanging when I asked 'How can I stop asking for outside guidance'?Here I am doing it again - I suppose it's an addiction..Well I think hex 9 says little by little I will stop doing it and maybe ultimately realise properly that I am not being guided by signs that often increase my anxiety anyway.. and that this uncertainty is the weak element in myself stopping me from reaching my 'full potential?... but it can't be eradicated over night ie confidence takes years for some people to develop?I think I'm pretty clear on the theory it's just putting it into practice is so hard! as you may have gathered from my previous posts - my journey to 'self discovery' (and acceptance) keeps suffering setbacks! And I am at the core of these... my own worst enemy... Anyway clarification on my fist question would be much appreciated, and any thoughts on Hex 9... I just can't seem to stop doing it cause often what I think of I will see ( to answer a stupid question) and its been going on for long I can't accept it as just coincidence! It's a great waste of energy though - how will I ever be myself and thus a useful memebr of society!Sorry to rattle on again  with the same old same old - I know I need to get a grip and some self belief, that isn't dependant so much on external confirmation and gratification..  but stability and inner strength does not seem to be readily available to me at the mo..Thanks :bows:"
3580,"I've noticed when using the free reading generator on here, if your internet disconnects without warning, a new hexagram still appears when the reading button is clicked on....so, that got me thinking, that the hexagram can't be generated in response to the question (ie when you decide to click the button), the next hexagram must always be sitting there waiting.  So for eample,if you do one reading, your internet disconnects without you realising then you ask something else, a hexagram appears, but it can only do that if it was already there queing, before your connection terminated and before you thought of your question - so, can this be a valid method for consulting the oracle??I cant see how it can be, unless the oracle can predict what you are going to ask next before you've decided on anything, or; if the first hex had already been generated before you asked the question and clicked the button,  to get the hex that really related to your question, you'd have to click for a reading again......hmmm.  Any thoughts?????"
3581,"Hi allI've been away a while so missing the board but I'd just like to update you on the situation that I asked about in this thread, http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=5828  in the spirit of this board being about shared readings.  I feel that it's important for us to share the answers and insights as well as just asking the questions.  Jesed kindly did a time-based interpretation of my reading and one of the predictions was:3.- From June 16 to June 30, the relation may find a serious dificult time; like someone waiting in the blood. There is a risk of emotional hurts. To avoid that, you need to act with calmness, clarity but energy. Being humble is the best aproach to take.Well that has panned out more accurately and sadly than I could ever have imagined.  I found out on Friday that my ex is back with the girl he was seeing before me.  I guess someone was waiting in the blood and it's me that is having the emotional hurt over it.  I just feel like I was a prop for him, a substitute for her and it's like the man I thought he was just doesn't exist.  I even had the indignity of having to ask him was he back with her because I saw mails from her in his inbox.  He didn't even have the respect for me as a friend to be straight with me, he had told me he couldn't be involved with anyone while going through his personal problems but yet he got back with the person he had nothing but derogatory comments for.  He even told me previously how there was no way he'd get back with her but he felt so vulnerable with me because I wasn't out of a longer-term rship and he felt that I could change my mind and go back.  I feel like an idiot for believing that he was sincere about working his stuff out and how important I was to him.  I really believed he was an honest, decent guy who was bravely tackling his issues.  Now I just see him as a coward and a snake.  I even saw in the preview of the mail that he refers to her with the same affectionate name as he did with me - she was with him before me so I feel like he just transferred the name to me and it makes my skin crawl.  It makes lies of all he said to me.  I feel like I was the other woman, the blip in the middle of their relationship when he had been telling me he could see us being long-term.  I trusted him because I knew him previously and he seemed so genuine.The really sad thing is that the previous week we had to go away with work and he even said himself how people thought we were acting like a married couple.  My other friend who was away with us thought she could see us getting back together because of how well we got on and how obviously close we were. It all just feels like an illusion now though.I'll be honest and say that I'm full of anger at the moment.  I have 2 full days scheduled with him to work on a project this week.  I can't get out of it.  The other girl works here too, albeit in a different department, and apparently she knows we had a thing.  I feel sorry for her, taking on that, but nonetheless it's going to be so hard to go through this time.  I do know who she is and I see her around sometimes.  Now she knows who I am and what happened too.Anyway, Jesed's next prediction was that for the next 2 weeks our rship might face a better time - well he's going away for 2 weeks next week so it's better that he's out of here.  I can't possibly see how the relationship itself could face a better time though, it feels like the man I thought he was is just an illusion, like he's dead to me or never existed. I'm a little shocked and confused at the moment and feeling very vulnerable.  I'm not sure if I should ask the iChing anything or if I could handle any answers without more confusion.  Maybe someone could advise me what you think would be best to do, or even what to ask.  I just wanted to share with you how accurate this seems to be and to once again thank Jesed and everyone else who contributed to my previous thread.Sorry this isn't a happy tale, but if nothing else I hope it strengthens your confidence in the iChing.Applegirl"

3586,"I asked IC ""how might I get a pay rise"". answer is 4 (MENG) youthful Folly with lines moving at 4 and 6 changing to 40.BACKGROUNDI have been in the same part time position for near 4 years, I work for a charity.Funding for the organisation is diminishing, the future looks bleak. For the last 2.5 years I have assumed a supervisory role. Yey my pay grade and job title does not reflect this. I have also obtained other relevent experience, knowledge and skills which extend my input even more and enable others to do their job more efficiently. My role ineffect has extended. I asked my manager for a pay rise and formal job evaluation. The Trade Union rep, my colleague, since, told me not to bother because it could mean others will lose their jobs and/or there was no more money in the pot for manouever. The CEO now wants me to put in writing how my role has changed (it has -substantially). I will not go ahead if it will affect the company and my colleagues adversly. I would be happy to accept a title which better reflects my role so that when I finally do move on It will be easier to transist in an appropriate role. I am not ready to move on yet because the position suits my current life and the other things (volunteer and study). My manager greatly appreciates my input. But, there is a lot going on with the company at the minute.I think the IC is advising me to grow up and stop being selfish - but be realistic, I am wondering if is also telling me to cut back on what I do for the company - hex 40?I would appreciate any opinions you have to offer on this!

3588,"Hello!I wondered if someone would help me with a decision I have to take. There is somewhere I am expected to go that is important to another. I'd prefer not reveal too much detail on this occasion, except that it is a complicated scenario and past events, partly my fault, have made the event awkward. I know that if I don't go this will be difficult and awkward in the future for lots of parties concerned. I also know that if I do go, this will also be awkward and difficult, as above, and for the person who it is important to and I will be scrutinised and will have to be very careful what I do and say. The consequence of not being careful and behaving according to what is expected, i think, would not be helpful in the future. I want to make the best decision but I am not sure which will have the best outcome.I asked IC the outcome if I dont attend, I received 60.1.3.5> 46and if I do, I received: 47.5> 40They both seem to bring an imprived scenario eventually but in different ways. Not attending seems to suggest ok, but it would be good to try and make up for it with the person concerned, whereas attending seems to suggest to remember what I am there for and to concentrate on that and be myself and try to keep my head down and avoid the people who I may have troubles with...Actually I dont think I have a clue what to do...Id really appreciate your ideas.Thank you"

3594,"Dear People,this is my first post on this forum. Not every, but many days I ask an hexagram for the day. Today was hex 52, Keeping still.There is much to say for it in my condition. Firstly it is not very wise to move, speak before you know the situation you are in. Second, my neck hurts (sorry, don't know the english term for it). There are many reasons for that, and I am not going to unveil them now.Don't even move your toes. First look around in the garden (this forum), then reflect. Beware of your ambitions, don't get yourself involved in cockfights and ratrace.But neither suppres your affections or needs, else good things will express through other channels  like poison: recognize your hopes and fears.Because, in the end it can only be your heart that makes the descision, not your hopes not your fears, not your ambitions.Then, when speech is neccesary, speak.Taking a deep breath, counting to ten, concentrate on your heart before you move, can save any situation Some time ago I I wanted to change my social behaviour. I had the feeling my timing in exchanges was very bad. Then I asked the I what to do, came this hex with the first line. Since that time, when in serious situations, I put both my feet firmly on the ground, and when my toes move, itch, I don't move. I wait till they are calm. When doing so I am taken much more serious, my speech is much more self assured, my actions are much more balanced. It took me 30 years to understand that I only needed a very simple action to get rid of that unbalance. :bows:By the way, full name: Bert Dalmolen, try www.bertdalmolen.comwarm regards to all,bert."
3595,"Hello everyone,Very new here, even though not so new with the i-ching . . It's been 6 years that i'm using it (with long intervals in between) but often held back from totally embracing the answers. I usually tend to see various ways of interpreting the hexagrams thus not recognizing which one is the most correspondent to my situation.This time it is a romantic issue that got me into making questions. Two weeks ago went to a concert with some friends and by the end of the night ended up exchanging phone numbers with the singer. I had no intention of getting involved, recently broke up from an important 4 year long relationship so didn't really think about the next guy. This was a pleasant surprise then, mostly since it came about so harmoniously (almost like getting into a kind of dance) but since then has turned complicated.The first thing was that it took us some time to actually arrange a meeting (like both of us  really resisted but still wanted to meet). We went out to a place called ""The Green Elephant"", were a bit awkward, i turned it into enthusiastic talk, he got looser after a while. laughed a lot but kept distances. We left saying we would meet again.The next day we exchanged messages, caring but still distant. The weirdness really begun the following night when one of my flatmates met him (accidentally? so she says) in a club, danced, drank and ended up sleeping over at his place (not with him though) because she couldn't get back. The same morning, still ignorant of the situation, sent him a message with info he might be interested in but got no response. Since then neither me nor her have heard from him (she is in a relationship but not sure where it's heading and really into this singer). Tomorrow night (exactly 2 weeks after the 1st concert) they are playing again. We all got emails about it from their mailing list but no personal invitations.All this set me off in a series of questions:1) Why did this turn into such a knotty situation? 16.4 to 22)Will he call me? 163)What is the dynamics between us? 55.1.6 to 564)is it wiser to not go in the concert? 55.2.4.5 to 5 (note: I have a thing with 5, i think it is a wining number for me)5)What will happen if i go? 20.6 to 8 6)Would an involvement with him be positive in my life? 16.1.3 to 55the first 2 questions I couldn't really grasp, the 3rd for me showed that if i wanted sth i had to move, 4th that i had to let him make the 1st move, 5th was clear that if i moved we would get together emotionally, but the 6th really got me confused:Obviously i am excited and enthusiastic about him but if i keep on with this approach no good is coming in any way (1) but at the same time, (line 3) that I should be inspired, show initiative and not be slow in going on. The 2 changing lines seem completely contradictory to me, whereas the relating 55 could be both positive (no fear) but also negative (decline to come).(also in asking 'what will happen if i go to the concert but not with my flatmates' i got 1.4.5.6 to 11)Sorry if i tired you with my long post but I really need to hear sth coming from a different point of view on all this!!Thnx for your patience . .rodaki"

3597,"Hello dear YI divers...I'm an studying a lot these days to understand better the Yi. I have been getting great insights about myself lately. I do have some questions when I am asking about someone else...  How do you approach a reading when you would like to understand the other's person views, attitudes, etc. ?  I think I need to understand how to read the Yi when the answer is based in a question about someone that is not yourself and that is not present either? For example, I made this question ""what he feels for me?"" and got 44.5.6 to 32. This is a real question about a guy but we are not friends so far -he's a sort of trainer for em . If the reading was about myself, I can relate easily with the answer that the Yi gives me... so, how should I look at it when I want to understand someone else's attitude, or feelings, without putting my own hopes/fears/as a filter of what the Yi is responding? Thank you in advance...!Samantha"
3598,"Why has Mr. (or Ms) willowfox disappeared? Nonetheless, I didn't throw a hexagram for this "

There are reasons I am hesitant, one of which is I am having to let go of other commitments for it, not to mention it may be a little over my head. On the other hand, the opportunity is good. I received:Limitation 60.2.4 > 17 Folowing.Would I be right to read that I need to put limits around what I can do from what I can't - before success can be attained. The result 17 indicates that success can be attained if I define my boundaries. Can I conclude from this reading to stick it out, define my boundaries and success can be attained?"
3602,"Hello allI'd like some help with a situation.I have a meeting in a few days time and I asked the Yi what I could do to serve my long-term goal re. the situation. The answer was 14.3, relating hexagram 38. I'm still figuring this out but the answer seems positive (as in there's great potential here if only I behave modestly?).Still not knowing what to do exactly, and considering it is very likely that I might get an offer, I asked, first, what will be the consequences re. my goal if I refuse the offer and got 29 unchanging.Then I asked about the consequences if I accept the offer (which is tempting in the short term but I have the feeling it might set me back) and got 52.1,2,4,5,6.Now, I think that I should not accept the offer (well if I get it in the meeting). I'm not quite sure how to interpret 29 unchanging but I think 52 is telling me to just be still and stop thinking about the issue (although all those changing lines puzzle me). I have to add that I have received 52 with different changing lines each time twice when I asked about the overall situation (but not that meeting or that offer specifically). Is it time I got the message and just let things unfold? I wouldn't like to make any mistaken moves though. I'm confused. Any help would be appreciated. el_2"

3604,"Hi guys, I haven't been around for ages!  I have recently taken advantage of Hilary's mentoring program, which was absolutely fab! Out of funds at the moment though so I need your urgent advice regarding 10.3.I have asked for advice regarding my current situation (What is the best course of action regarding my ex partner to achieve a stability in life) and I got hexagram 10.3 moving to 1.  My situation briefly is that we split up a few months ago and there is an outstanding issue of sorting out my ex-partner's access to our son.  At the moment my ex is trying to convince me to get back with him and making all sorts of efforts but if this fails he keeps threatening with legal action to fight for our son.  I have a feeling that despite his recent good behaviour and efforts to wow me back he is secretly planning how best to fight me in court (possibly collecting information against me???).  Line 10.3 worries me a little, as it indicates that I am being too trusting/naive in this situation??  I thought I was being cautious but perhaps I am spending too much time with my ex (for the sake of our son) and exposing myself to danger?The hexagram 10 speaks of treading on the tail of the tiger but not getting bitten whereas line 3 warns of the danger of actually getting bitten but I don't know quite how to prevent it.  Please let me have your thoughts!Many thanks!"
3605,"Dear friends, I am learning to analyze readings and would like your input in regards thisspecific reading. First I asked why I am drepressed and got 29.2.4.6 moving to 12... As per my interpretation I saw that my depression might be caused for something I might be overlooking, something wrong that I am doing, I have been unable to deal with so I've lost my way, and stagnant. Then I asked to the I Ching what is making me feel depressed and  I've got 58.1.5 moving to 40.It has been quite confusing to me interpret this reading -perhaps because of I am totally lost -as 29.6 seems to tell me... My interpretation is quite negative in any case. Would you be able to shed some light on this? I would really like to understand what is happening to me so I can free myself from this low feelings. Thank you so much in advance."
3606,"Sigh.  I’ve been depressed lately.  I will admit it is partly due to the seeming loss of my friendship with the man who I also developed a physical/emotional attachment to.  But it’s more than that.  It’s my life in general that feels a bit empty at the moment.  Things do not seem to be clicking in to place in regards to most areas of my life.  It all seems like an uphill struggle.   And despite my efforts and doing the inner work, nothing seems to change. I asked the yi “how can I get out of this rut?”I received Hex 39 (obstruction) with moving line three changing to Hex 8(union)Coincidentally I received this same hex  about a week ago when asking about my friend.   The question I asked before was “will our friendship survive”Is the fact that this is the same hex as before (when asking of friend) telling me the rut will improve when I let go of HIM?  From what I understand of line 39.3 it means not to pursue your interest at this time.  In my last attempt at reading this hex I wanted it to mean that if I stopped chasing after him (line 3)  that this might lead to a union (hex 8).  But, since things have not changed (and I’ve not been chasing) I’m feeling more skeptical about that interpretation.  Now I’m reading it as the fact that my expectation and hope of hex 8 is the obstruction (39) to my happiness.  But I dunno…seems we can glean whatever we want from the readings.  Any encouraging words would be appreciated."
3607,"Hi there,my life is kind of ""stuck"" right now, i'm currently working in a dislocated place for almost a year and a half. i'm quite sociable and opened minded but never found anyone that i felt comfortable to be friend's. Summing it up, I'm not feeling happy where i am, what i'm doing, anyway i always ask the Yi for answers, i found an add for a new job and my resume really fits in, so i've asked the Yi if i should send an application for the job, which we repliesd with Hex 46-Advancing, line 1,6 changing to 26-Major restraint. The line one point to advance but six points to imature advance and changinto 26 wich says that are obstacules to overcome. don't really know if i should advance with precautions and solve unfinished bussiness or if i should wait to get more mature professionally but keep looking for a better job?Clear insights would be very apreciatedkiss candy ross"
3608,"Hi,Just a quick one - I'm thinking of messaging someone who is going away anyway (as am I) and so good chance never see him again in my life - and so I thought I'd ask the Iching basically whether I should attempt at maintaining some kind of connection (that is if he replied) or just leave it up to 'fate' as it were.. or accept that it would be futile.I got 23.1, 5, 6 to 3 Getting 'Splitting Apart' I've always taken as literal ie that person isn't meant to be a part of your life, but as it changed to 3 'Difficulty at beginning' I thought maybe that could mean that we could maintain a connection (if he's interested which I don't know) but there will be a physical split (both travelling etc) but that this is a difficulty at the beginning of something...? thus maybe I should send a message to keep a connection up (again if he replies).It'd just be a friendly general one anyway and if he didn't reply then it really wouldn't matter ie no embarrassment as could potentially never see him again in my life! but I don't want to do something that deep down I know is my naiivety or flight of fancy..Anyways, if you were contemplating contacting someone and got this answer, would you bother??  There was a bit in the Wilhelm description of 23 that could be encouraging if I've read it right : "" favour comes through the court of ladies""... ?Thanks "
3609,"I have a friend who I really enjoy when we talk or get together, but making the connection can be challenging. We talked last week and it was great, then made plans for the other day. The day came and went with an odd excuse about something coming up. It was probably true, the thing that came up, but there is a pattern I really don't like where this friend lacks some empathy and doesn't get impact on others. Why did this blow-off happen?62.3 to 16What if I just walk away from this friendship?34.3 to 54What if I continue to pursue this friendship and getting together?55.1 to 62Then today, I asked another questions which I perhaps should not have asked since Yi really already answered me: What is the best approach to take with this situation?12.1.2.4 to 61It sounds to me as though walking away would be like hitting my head against the wall, wouldn't get me anywhere, and I should definitely pursue the friendship for what it intended to be, even though it may a time-limited situation. It also sounds like there was some reason it would have been dangerous to get together the other day. I am not sure about the meaning of today's reading, the 12 to 61? Perhaps it's just reinforcing what I already know, to move forward with this friendship for what it is? I enjoy this friend and can't help but believe there is some reason we are in each other's lives.Last edited: Jun 24, 2008"
3610,"My situation in relation with my beloved is somehow complicated. It is about 9 month that I asked her for friendship. First, everything went on good. But I didn’t know that she was recently with her bf finished and she was still uncertain. It took no much time for her to resume that relation and therefore our relation was cut. We have had for about 3 month no relation and after that I again asked her if she is alone, we can start ours. She told me that that relationship still goes on, but she is not confident in it. She stressed that she will cut that relation, but not knows when, and if she cut it, I will be the candidate for the new relationship. In that time I consulted Yi, what should I do now and got 5.2 to 63. Obviously, I decided to wait, not know till when.. Yesterday I called her again (after about 2-3 month). She told me that her relation with the guy continues, and she, normally, will not end it very soon. Because she is now thinking about some other objects as her PhD Exam (in next year) and immigrating abroad and so on. You see, she prefers not to think for the new relationship now and it is better for her to continue the friendship with the guy till the time she will get on a stable situation (as a PhD student or immigrated) and then decide for the future. However, she told me that if everything continues on normally, in the stability, she will choose me for the enduring relation. But who knows how things will go on? I was really depressed by that answer. Seemingly, it takes at least 1 year for her to gain that stability, and then, she might like me as a bf. However, she might not. What should I do? Whether wait or end it? If it really takes that time and everything is so unreliable, I prefer not to continue. But if there is something different on the way, that I am not aware of (maybe something divine), I will wait. I asked Yi: what should I do now? And got Hex. 32. 2, 4 to 15. I think it suggest me to preserve. But I could not understand the 4th line: no game in the field. Also, have no idea about the Hex. 15. whether if there is no gain? Or should I take the project easy and go on my own way (hex 15 says that?). I don’t know. I’m confused. Preserve or cut it off? Anybody can help me here?"

I then asked what is the obstruction, received 14.3 to 38and finally how can the obstruction be overcome received 8.2,3,4,5 to 4.I'm trying to figure out what this is telling me as far as the closer bit goes. Have I already done all that I can and won't go any farther or am I being told that if I choose this route I best be prepared to do so slowly and with purpose? 39 depending who one reads is either find allies or be ready to go it alone or maybe means that my next plan ought to involve more than just her and I. Woo..getting insight mid typing is an interesting feeling. 14 has me a bit confused, the changing line makes me think that I shouldn't make an offer unless I'm VERY serious about doing so. However 14 makes me think of my current project(s). I consistently find something new to do and every time swear it will be the last thing. The 'great possession' if you will. Only when I'm finished with my project can I move onto something new? I can also dare to suggest that her affections would be the great possession? 38 just confuses the crap out of me. Is the entire answer suggesting that I need to dedicate my time and efforts to one thing?Finally to 8 and 4. 8 being union/unity gives me the idea that I have to bring people together in some way and form. 4 being childhood/youthful folly/ignorance has me lost. She is quite a bit younger but 4 also suggests being able to be taught by the young. Am I onto anything or more lost now than before? "

3618,"A Spanish-speaking penpal who knows I'm interested in the Yi sent me the following email:  ""Estoy triste y confundido.

Things are going badly in his life and he doesn't understand why, but he has his suspicions that someone has put a curse on him through witchcraft.  (This is a loose translation that summarizes several emails).  I asked the Yi, ""what does my penpal need to understand about his situation?""  The response was 29 with no changing lines.It seems clear that he is in a difficult situation and going through a period of crisis, as 29 suggests.  I don't particularly believe in witchcraft, though for my penpal it is an accepted cultural explanation for his difficulties.  Any advice on what else 29 might mean for him?   Thanks,Tony"

3620,"Hi, My name is Carl, I am new here.I have learned the Yi for a couple of years, from some I-Ching master in China.I'd like to make some friends here, and if you need my help, I can help interprete your hexagrams or even read your ""4 pillars"".Information needed from you:1) Your gender;2) The hexagram you have, together with the question, as well as the date of the hexagram is generated;3) The qestion that you ask. It better be as simple and short to make it easier for the interpretation. E.g. ""Will I (or my son/daughter) pass the exam?"", ""When will I meet a lover?"", ""Should I go change my job and when will I be likely to find it?"", ""Will my travel be a safe one?""If you want to me read your overall life, I will use ""4 pillars"", which is a sub-branch of the Yi. Your gender, together with the date,time, and place of your birth (best if you know the longitude of the place you were born) are needed. Please be reminded, that I am only doing this for fun and practice, and if I do poorly, please bear with me, it will not the Yi to be blamed. I need your feedback. I need to know how I do, and I need your feedback to help me improve.If you have questions, please let me know Carl"
3621,"Hi,I'm still looking for another job. And I haven't been very lucky so far . 2 weeks ago I applied for another one. And I asked the IC :What if I keeping hoping for a positive response for this job? I received 8.6> 20. At that same I thought . But I thought this was clearly reflecting the situation: I applied at the last minute and I had little time to prepare my application. In the book I have it says that there won't be "" a gathering if I arrived too late"". (But I think Karcher's translation is different (A group without a head) which loses me totally  ). And the relating hex. 20 is contemplating. So I guess I just have to wait and maybe reflect on myself.Still, I casted again the IC with the same question 2/3 days ago ( Iknow I shouldn't) and I received : Hex.21 (Bitting through) I'm not sure the IC amnswered my question but maybe the question behind the question : what should I do to get better? Bitting through maybe...Take difficult decisions about my job (leaving it). Any insights ? Thank you for your help.Mousse"

3628,"Hi,I just joined today after I was puzzled an looking for an answer. I am not too sure how to interprete the reading I got. I am too involved and i dont want to make it into something it is not (i hope this makes sense to you all...). The short, very short story....About 2 years ago I met a wonderful man. but we were both in a relationship and although I felt something, this was not meant to be.I also know he felt the same about me. We kept in contact, mainly by mails. I got a bit of a shock early this year when we met up again and we basically told eachother we were both getting out of our former relationships.I don't see him too often, we both have different lives but there is something about our friendship that seems to be special. It just makes me wonder if I met the right man, but at the wong time.  The first question I asked was if he indeed is Mr right. I received 35 unchanging.Then i asked how he feels about me now.I received 16.3 -> 62The last question was how the status of our friendship is. I received 49.4 ->63I would appreciate a bit of help. im just a newbee here.Thanx,"
3629,"So last April I posted asking about getting a GTI vs a Rabbit and the month of June. Dear Willowfox posted in reply: GTI Hex 53.2,4, 5 > 50 . Hex 53.2 this car is calling you, it is a symbol of peace and concord, but again you should share it with others, giving rides etc but not quite the same idea of public as in Hex 14.3. Hex 53.4 says you are not sure about this car but soon you will make up your mind to get this one. Hex 53.5 suggests that as you get down to the business of buying this one there could be some last minute problems that will need to be resolved, but don't worry after some minor hassles everything will come out right. Hex 50 the Cauldron, the GTI, it is about nourishing you both physically and spiritually, it signifies great success.Click to expand...I made the mistake of not following up, it was the weekend following the fourth of July and the GTI I wanted was where it should be. Now it's in my drive way, thank you for the assistance Willowfox. I also think that the changing line 5 is starting to kick in, my beloved car is having some minor electrical issues, one being an airbag fault light (the MK5 is famous for it) the other being my steering wheel controls (paddle shifters and audio controls) are not receiving power. I also thank the rest of you folks who've helped me in the past. I've done a bit of research on our beloved 44 in regards to many things and even found a relation question that fit my 44 changing line 2 to 33. The question I found was about trying to recover a relation, mine is about starting. I recently found a *shudder* coworker who I get along with pretty well and who is into a number of the same things I am including: Cars, car audio, and motorcycles. I am seriously considering being in love....eventually. However 44 and especially line 2 seems to be very negative and 33 being retreat or otherwise hide isn't very positive either. Given that I asked 'How do I get closer to X' is this a statement of if you choose to do this, be warned she is a strong woman and there will be a number of people against the situation so be wary of them and retreat from those who are negative? Or is this saying that she'll be a nag and that I'll want to run away in the end anyway. There could also be the fact she is 99.9% sure she's moving in Jan/Feb of next year to AZ. She (possibly) jokingly made the comment of my going to AZ as I dislike where I live. Whether as a roomie or something more would be peachy by me, she's just plain a cool chick. Reading this http://www.yijing.nl/i_ching/hex_33-48/hex_e_44.htm has influenced my decision as well. Line 2 goes into not allowing people who are not essential to me to influence my future as it is MY future. I make the following statements of fact and these are known to her and many others as well: I dislike where I live. I want to live somewhere warm, with a race track, and with the ability to get back into martial arts if time permits. Phoenix AZ just happens to have a race track as well as the three martial arts I'm interested in getting into. Also..it's rather warm there. At this point I supposed I ought to be asking myself who's essential to me and who is not. Family of course is but where do I draw the line between friends and potential relation. I know a number of my friends would accept my decision without question, others would tell me I'm a bonehead for trying to see her, and still others would think I'm a bonehead for trying to go to AZ. Have I taken in every angle yet..or am I missing a few? I decided to examine a more individual situation and asked: ""How would it benefit me to move to Phoenix, AZ?"" I received 32 unchanging. I tossed in after that ""with X"" and realized after getting 52 I should have been more specific in my time frame. 52 is keeping still (Huang) and the last statement before explaining changing lines is ""Keeping still is meant to prepare one's mind and spirit to progress when the time comes."" Referring back to a conversation at lunch a couple days ago I joked that she should go first, scope out the area then call me in 'a couple months.' The time frame would be around when my father would return to the area to retire. I moved back home to help my mother who has an occasional nasty case of arthritis in both hands as well as to acquire some new skills for my job. The person who was supposed to be my trainer left so that made one less reason for me to be here, however I do serve many functions around the house.Last edited: Jun 13, 2008"

3631,"I asked how a guy I have been chatting with online is feeling about me after these exchanges.  I've never quite understood 43 well.  Any ideas? Me:  That last pic of you is beautiful BTW.. sorry for the inconvenient second thought....Him:  Thank you for compliment...but ""inconvenient""?Me:  Inconvenient... because I bombarded you with numerous emails....Him:  Oh...I thought it was because you might have been aroused at work or  something.Me: I believe the word I used was beautiful.  Not typically the word I use to describe something I find arousing... although, I do find the hair around your navel a turn on.   There.. you finally got one out of me!  God you are tenacious!  Via a compliment even!Him:  I wouldn't say ""tenacious""...just frequently flip or glib. I was referring not to ""beautiful"" but ""inconvenient"", anyway.   You sure that's hair?Me:  Yes I know you were referring to ""inconvenient"". I was trying to make a point. however, and using ""beautiful"" as my reference.  Not hair?? Well, were you maybe wearing a sweater and eating honey just before that pic was taken?  Do you currently see hair around your navel area when you look down?"
3632,"and I thought of asking myself by asking the IC.What wants life from me?Hex 3.3.5 > hex 11It is a big question that's for sure.

3633,"Hello Everyone,I am, as some of you know, working a 12 step programme of recovery. I am now 2 years sober. As a single parent, my mum and dad have been amazingly supportive in babysitting my daughter in the evening when I need to attend meetings. They generally do it about 2 nights a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. Depemds on lots of things. I have today spoken at length with them and they have in no uncertain terms told me they are happy to do it and they like to be with there grandchild who is no trouble. I have noticed an atmosphere from my two older sisters, and today my parents told me that they have been saying I shouldn't go to meetings at night and should go in the day and that my parents should not babysit. This sort of thing is nothing new, they are weird when it come to me, childless and controlling as hell.I am fine as I have spoken clearly to my mum and dad, but wanted to know how should I proceed with my sisters?

3634,"""How will I meet my future husband?""Answer: Hexagram 59, changing lines 2, 5 and 6. Then Hexagram 2.My interpretation, based on other threads in this database/forum:Hexagram 59 - make things clear through dispelling illusions (and through eradication of selfishness). Involves the concept of trust and penetrating defenses leading to the ability to clear things away - to dispell illusions. The following comments from Pedro's post at http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=2862...   One of LiSe's beautifully rendered phrases gives another clue: ""Having to save one's life puts many other things back in the place where they belong, often even completely out of sight"". So there you have it, we're back to the eradication of selfishness, that once again comes naturally when one has to run for his life, be it menaced by a flood, or our own negative emotions.Click to expand...Actually I see saving oné's life as the EPITOMY of selfishness -- you put yourself first, your life above all else... so I am not sure about this note. The issue of ""illusions"", and the very term itself, strikes me however. I'm living in a foreign country and often wonder if my future husband is elsewhere in the world (ie I am in the wrong place). My illusions about this country have long since been dispelled. I do not know if that is waht the Yi refers to here. Pedro's post continues: What I cant find in the text is a clue as to how we can develop the necessary strength to achieve this ego deflation, being it the hardest task one can endeavor. The solution obviously comes from an act of will (#46), but the Yi has also given me some clues. One of the best I got was #59 -> #52. Meditation, calmness, settling of emotions, that is how to get there (no surprise here, there is no other way to tame the ego, not since Buddha). This mutation also involves all the lines I feel important: 2, 3 and 5. At another time, it told me that in order to be able to win this battle, I needed to have the perseverance of a warrior (57, line 1).Click to expand...So: persevere, be strong, but meditate, be calm and settled and centered.... By taking the nuclear hexagram, #27 Nurturing, we see another way to approach the hidden depth of #59. You have to nurture yourself as well as others correctly, something that obviously one's ego is not always willing to remember. Finally, one last clue from the preceding hexagram, #58 Joy, or Exchange. If you read the lines, there is a whole lot of ways in which we can wrong in our search for happiness. It is imperative to realize that the real joy can only come from within, and that we already have all we need. That realization shatters the ego immediately, cause you basically don't need it to fulfill your desires any more. You have it all, so what need is there to want anything else? If only we can understand this, we will have no trouble following the advice of hexagram #59.Click to expand...Again, I see nurturing oneself as a slightly selfish endeavor, so this hexagram is confusing me in its overall message. But Pedro's final comments above ring true and these are themes I've heard from the Yi a lot recently. ie Dont go searching elsewhere for happiness. But I'm not... i asked about how i would meet my future husband. LiSe wrote: 59 Don't hope for a distant future where all roads will come together. It is the illusion of perspective: when you walk towards it, the point recedes. Make your place here, where you are, and be aware of all these different roads, all opening possibilities. At least if you allow them to be open. That is why in your life right here you should create temples, where rational and restricted thoughts do not exist. Rational you will not be able to cross the stream, for that you need your soul, or the support of the gods. Remove the quais from your soul, like a river with washlands. It will never flood, but it will flow wide or narrow, according to what it needs. And it can be crossed whenever necessary, because it stays shallow enough, without dangerous rapids. As long as waters can move freely, they move gently.Click to expand...ie live in the present. It's not *where* you are, it is *how you are* in that place: present, and open to possiblity. OK I can deal with that.So with that, moving to the lines. Line 2: At the dissolution He hurries to that which supports him. Remorse disappears.""The symbolism of the upper trigram is of a temple in which one can find shelter from the dangers of the pit below. The implication is that one should find some spiritual means of protection from the evil. The altar represents the means that one has established to protect oneself.""=Avoid evil? Protect oneself? So if I have to be careful... maybe this means filter through the situation or potential meetings?Line 5: Line 5: His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat. Dissolution! A king abides without blame.[If one's way is blocked, one goes around]""Just as a high fever is dispersed in perspiration, so the king may relieve his anxieties by dispersing his possessions among the needy. Great and generous ideas are necessary for success at this time.""Line 5 another interpretation: In times of general dispersion and separation, a great idea provides a focal point for the organization of recovery. Just as an illness reaches its crisis in dissolving sweat, so a great and stimulating idea is a true salvation in times of general deadlock. It gives the people a rallying point - a man in a ruling position who can dispel misunderstandings.More on LINE 5: the self (the king) discovers that dispersion is what he or she really wants or that dispersing is the best thing to do in this situation. It becomes his or her decision instead of something that more or less just happens to him or her. Consequently the self assumes full responsibility for the dispersion, makes it his or her 'cause', and takes the lead in the process. This is a change of attitude. I have to say the dispersion implies movement to me. To antoher country? What else could this mean? Dispel misunderstandings about...what?Line 6: He dissolves his blood. Departing, keeping at a distance, going out, Is without blame.[To overcome dangers dispersing assets helps] )All the commentaries upon this text disagree upon the precise meaning of the words. But it seems clear that ‘dispersing bloodiness’ means the avoidance of bloodshed and removing oneself from the danger of injury.LiSe wrote: 59.6 Not the things that happen to you shape your life, but your reaction to them. Even a dreadful experience left behind will not affect the quality of your being, but even a small annoyance, rekindled day after day, will thoroughly spoil it.Click to expand...LINE 6 = Leaving behind the habits of self, the pinching shoes, the old ways or the passions which do not serve to further,  in favor of freedom from self obsession.“Act now and think about it later...just get out of there! (wherever that may be) and get as far as you can. NO one can blame you for running from this!”If that last interpretation is correct, it can't be talkinga bout husbands but about locations.And of course Hex 2, the Receptive...Can anyone else help me view this reading more clearly? Many thanks in advance. -e."
3635,"I’m still waiting to see if anything pan’s out romantically with the ""friend"".  Neither of us has made any effort to do anything to address the “situation” which was that we kissed a couple of times and then both did a pull-back (I kept getting hex 33 for a while but not getting that one any longer).  I’m not sure if we’re both just being stubborn, if there’s just no interest on his part, or what.So I asked the yi “what do I need to know about my relationship with X?”5.4,5,6 to 14Hex 5 WaitingWaiting for what?The fourth and fifth lines seem ominous.

3642,"Hi,Well, a couple of weeks ago I wrote about how I was pretty lonely (see thread ""lonely and hex 55"").  I'm 26 and have never had much of anything until just recently (no boyfriends, dates, nada, though I think I'm a pretty okay person, maybe even a catch.  There's more of a description in the other thread.  Anyway, a couple of crisis points happened recently, I lost work, went on a couple of dates with this one guy in particular.  I asked a couple of guys on friendly dates, there was one that I really really liked- theoretically, a very good match for me.  We had deep conversations about philosophy, spirituality, biology, economics, childhood experiences, anything!  He is someone who is super charming and somewhat of a ladies' man, but not in a gross way (example: at a wedding this weekend, he made sure to dance with all of the girls, even ones who were not good dancers, or not good-looking, etc.  Some of the ones who weren't so proficient he tried to help and spent extra time with.)  He never ignores anyone, male or female, and is honestly interested and curious about what everyone has to say, whether it be the kids next door, some random person at an art show, or the homeless guy in the subway station.Anyway, about a month ago when we were hanging out he brought up the subject of us, and said that I was someone he had fantasized about making love to, and never really thought it would happen, but that he did not think we should pursue things.  The problems are several: he is moving home to Europe most likely in a couple of months, when his job ends in the US.  He does not have another job lined up, nothing really seems to pique his interest.  He is considering quitting his career as a research scientist completely, and pursuing music or teaching, or even going to live and work on his family's farm.  I asked him to think about it and he said it just did not feel right, and that he was leaving, and I have not heard from him other than rehearsals or performances we've had together.  This weekend we ended up making out quite passionately at a wedding we attended/played at, although we decided not to have sex.  He again reiterated the fact that he felt that he was not the right guy for me, and that he was interested in a physical relationship only.I was surprised that anything at all happened, quite frankly, and feel strange about the fact that afterwards I feel less naive and idealistic about this whole thing.  Obviously, if he wanted to be in a relationship, he'd pursue things.  I sort of feel indifferent in a way, having realized that we are in two COMPLETELY different places (from what I gather, he's quite experienced, in both relationships and general life experiences).  Part of medoesn't care either way what happens, just taking it as a pleasant experience, part of me thinks I should just stop the physical part of things, part of me thinks I should see how he feels about doing this as a sort of learning experience for me to learn the ropes, if you will, part of me has no idea what's going on.  I have decided that sex is out of the question for me at this point, although I feel as though anything else would be fine.  I am working a lot and quite frankly am used to being independent, I don't know that a conventional relationship arrangement is right for me right now anyway.The whole thing has recently had another loop thrown in, as I overheard him say (he didn't know I was there) that he was very frustrated by not having a girlfriend, and even was ready for marriage (he is in his early 30s).  A friend of his also mentioned to me that he was really depressed by not having a girlfriend and couldn't find anyone.  None of our mutual friends know anything about us hanging out at all.I asked YJ, since I have to see him several times in the coming week, Please give me a hint on how to act around x in a manner that won't mess me up emotionallyand received28.1->43This seems to me to indicate a change in the situation, for sure.  With line 1, perhaps we were not cautious in the beginnings of this, although neither of us was at fault, it's just what happened.  I should remain confident in myself, even if I decide to renounce the relationship (in romantic/sexual terms).  The whole situation perhaps is a turning point for me in having relationships.  43 again seems to show change, a break-through.  I guess there's still part of me that is into him, I'm having a problem resolving the attraction with the reality that he says/seems to act like he does not want to be with me.  Pursuing my own interests can help with this.  Not really sure, thoughts?I also asked:What is the most likely outcome of a relationship between x and i if things remain how they are now?and received50 unchanging.I'm not quite sure what to think, although I see a lot of threads that point to this as promoting a spiritual transformation in one or both of us.  Figure out what I want?  Just give it time?  It will be transformative anyway, really, all experiences are, right?I guess I really am not sure what I think about all of this.  The one thing that's pretty good is that we both have been pretty honest with each other so far about where our heads are at, I don't have any regrets.  Does anyone have any ideas about the interpretation or questions to ask YJ?  I think some sort of change is indicated but I'm not really sure what that would be, or what questions I should ask myself or the YJ to figure it out.Thanks, and sorry this is so long!"

3646,"Hi all,I got back an assignment, for an essay and did really badly in. I put in alot of effort, but previous harsh assessment and blurry guidelines did not give me much confidence. So, I asked, what about this assignment? Is there hope that I can appeal or etc? (54.2>51)I feel the teacher is pretty strict with her marking, and since it was largely an abstract essay, she marked according to her fixed ideas. I was wondering if I could send an appeal explaining myself and my POV of my essay content. So I asked another question, what will be the result of my module grade? 52.2>18It kind of looks bad?Can I still achieve the final culminative grade that I want (if this appeal for a better grade is unsuccessful?) 21.1.2>64What are my chances of being accepted or being able to go further educationally, in an institution?15.1.5>63(it means I must be modest? what does this refer to?)Thank you for your help."

3655,"We are considering selling our property to our son with the intention of staying here a bit longer but eventually moving into a senior village in town which would give us a more active social life and possibilities of travel Trying to avoid the dreaded ""Yes or No?"" format, I simply asked the I Ching for a comment on our idea to sell and received 50.2 > 56.Our reasons for considering selling are that while this land is a glorious mountain hideaway, it's 10 miles out of town with no neighbors and in winter it's as cold as the tomb. I see 50.2 as refering to what a wonderful piece of property this is and 56 The Wanderer could be saying we simply feel it's time to move on, travel etc. This way of interpreting the hexagrams seems to be saying selling would be a positive, a natural evolution. However, I can also read these hexagrams as meaning we have something wonderful here and to beware of letting anything lure us away.Any ideas?Last edited: Jun 4, 2008"
3656,"Hello- I asked the iching recently- I had a relationship recently that didnt go anywhere, I sort of blamed myself-- I asked what can I make of this and received 44- I have received this before in regards to this relationship- I feel like I am to blame, for being overly aggressive maybe, as I never know what to make of that hexagram. So I asked, is there a way to look at this differently so that I can feel more positive about it- and received 56- 31- I dont know but I think maybe this says that I was traveling through- just briefly though-  Can anyone help with interpretation? thanks"

3658,"Hi ,I’ld like to hear  your thoughts about a reading.There is a hot situation in office and I have a part of responsibility of it. I failed to finish something and it became a big problem. The other’s side responsibility is that although I had discuss with them a personal health problem (fatigue, probable chronic)  they didn’t move quickly to prevent it. But this is just my point of view, we don’t agree on that.  Q, how to handle this situation with them (them-people we work together)A : 39.3 > 8There is an ethical responsibility to work harder but the reality is that I have to rest (doctors order) for a while. What it stroke me in Wilhelm’s comments was the phrase : “this line shows the man who must act as father of a family or as head of his kin”. This person looks like me and my role there, but  I can’t understand the meaning of “ But if he withdraws and turns back to his own”. And the fan yao 8.3 “You hold together with the wrong people”  Because I couldn’t understand which are those people (inside me or them) I asked.Q2 : what do you mean by “wrong people” ?A2 : 3.5 >24And then I askedQ2 What do they ( the people I work with) want from me.A:3 44.4 > 57There is a personal conflict in that situation , stronger than the one between me and them so at the beginning I’m not seen any clear answer. What do you think those lines talk about ?I'll appreciate any idea Maria"
3659,"Show me Mr. X’s role in my life.Hex 5. Nourishment, changing lines 1,2,5,6 and hex 52. Keeping Still MountainFirst, the lines:Line 1:  Waiting in the meadow.  It furthers one to abide in what endures. No blame.=Danger is still far off. The prudent man does not take cover, but he does not make himself vulnerable by advancing into the open. Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling of something impending. One must continue to lead a regular life as long as possible. Only in this way does one guard against a premature waste of strength, keep free of blame and error that would become a source of weakness later on.When difficulty appears in the distance it is best not to go out to meet it, but he stays alert and lets it come to him.  Water is seen in the heavens as clouds. But clouds, though they give promise of rain, also indicate that one must wait for that promise to be fulfilled. The Superior Man bides his time. Waiting with sincerity there will follow brilliant success. Perseverance brings great good fortune. It is advantageous to cross the great water at the right time. Patience, strength, and avoiding rash action overcomes difficulty.Line 2: Waiting on the sand. There is some gossip. The end brings good fortune.= The sand is soft and does not afford good footing. The danger gradually comes closer. Disagreements crop up. General unrest can easily develop in such times, and we lay the blame on one another. He who stays clam will succeed in making things go well in the end. Slander will be silenced if we do not graitfy it with injured retorts. Steadfast calmness in the face of danger will bring success at last.Someone else posted as well that line 2 can mean one is picking on oneself,(maintaining a negative self-image or self-destructive notions) and confusing one's ability to wait and relax while maintaining some healthy focus. I presume this means if you DO wait it out, things will be fine (good fortune).Line 5:  Waiting at meat and drink. Perseverance brings good fortune.= Even in the midst of danger there come intervals of peace where things go relatively well (this is such an interval?). If we possess enough inner strength, we shall take advantage of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle. we must know how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for perseverance is needed to remain victorious.Line 6:  One falls into the pit. Three uninvited guests arrive. Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.= The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a move on one’s own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.About Hex 5 in general, I found this:  This is not the Hex you would recieve when you are following a wrong track. With Hex 5 you are on track with your carmic purpose. It is just that your time to proceed hasn't come yet, but it definitely will arrive. There will be a follow- up. The path will take you further, the rain will definitely come.Wherever this will lead to, is another question. You are NOT at a dead end, even if it seem so at the moment....The ""not yet"" in Hex 5 is completely different from the ""not yet"" in 64. In Hex 5 there is nothing that YOU have to put right. Things/people/circumstances just need their time to ripen and it won't take very long. All you have to do is to wait and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by negative thoughts. They could make you give up a path that you should not give up. No self-sabotage, please.Click to expand...I also found a rather old but very intriguing post from Jesed about the timing of this hexagram, which I presume is the same for each calendar year. He wrote: The time for 5 is a short time, ruling only 90 days. Started in heaven (from May 1st to June 16) and will end in Water (June 17 tu July 31)Lines 1, 2 are in the past (line 1.. from May 1 to May 15, aprox.; line 2 from May 16 to May 31)Line 3 is in the present (from June 1 to June 15). A dificult situation, like have your army stocked in the mud. Risk of acting with precipitation... doing that, pitfall would come. What you need is remain calm; don't act, but gather inner straight to be ready when the right time would come.Line 5 will be active in the future (from July 1st to July 15 aprox). In that time, the moment for action wouldn't be at hand; but you could enjoy the time, give you some rest without deviation form your goal.Line 6 = July 16-31….Click to expand...This coincides with the meeting of Mr. X that I have had. Today is June 4. Since I drew lines 5 and 6, I would presume in July things will be happening but it isn't clear what,exactly, those things are.Finally Hex 52. The still mountain. THe only lines that strike me are these:     Thus the superior man     Does not permit his thoughts     To go beyond his situation.To me that implies keeping in the ""Now"" and not thinking longterm, not *worrying* about long term? I am confused about coming involved with this person (at all, plus when) and looking for insight from the Yi. This last hex seems to suggest not thinking about it and just living in the moment? (Is this like reaping ye wild oats? Or being more careful???) Also, the Yi seems to be giving me timelines of events rather than explaining Mr. X's role in my life per se. Do others see something else here?"
3660,"A very good friend was just turned down for health insurance by an insurance company.  He apparently has a heart problem.  In an effort to help him I asked the Yi,""What do I need to know about his heart?""27.6The source of nourishment.Awareness of danger brings good fortune.It furthers one to cross the great water.This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all influences that provide nourishment for others. Such a position brings with it heavy responsibility. If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good fortune and may confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such as crossing the great water. These undertakings bring general happiness for him and for all others.I see the heart as the ""source"" here.  It is what keeps the body functioning and it has a ""heavy responsibility"".  I believe the Yi is saying that so long as he takes care of himself (""awareness of danger"") he'll be OK (""good fortune). I feel that given how down he was last night about it this is a very positive answer.  I would very much appreciate any input into the reading and my interpretation.Thank you."

3662,"Just sharing a lovely reading that I just had and of course I'd welcome any comments!  My life over the past 6 months has been nothing short of a circus, and it has left me with extremely fundamental questions about myself, my beliefs and how to negotiate life - I guess it's a full blown identity crisis really !Anyway, this evening I took some time out to try and simplify not only where I'm at but who I am !  I took one of Hilary's suggested questions and asked the iChing to 'please show me something of myself', to which I got 46, unchanging.  Pushing upward, heaping up the small to achieve something great is really what I needed to hear about myself at the moment.  It helped remind me that behind all this questioning, re-evaluating and seeking is a sincere desire to keep progressing towards peace and happiness, and that really is part of who I am.  I keep chipping away at the cr@p and keep fighting in the belief that things will get better.  So tonight I really got the sense that the iChing is like an old friend who understands me, but added to that I got a little moment of synchronicity that made me smile.  After I finished my reading I logged on here to check other posts about 46, and a friend came online to tell me she'd learned to play the Journey song 'Don't Stop Believing' on the piano ... well that is one of my favo feel good songs ever!  It seemed to resonate with 46 totally!  That song is being played very loudly tomorrow on the way into work to set me up for the day Just thought I'd share a nice feel good reading with you allApplegirl  "
3663,I have been at my new job for 2 months now. I feel that i am lagging behind in getting up to speed on my job. That is my perception as my boss hasn't ever said anything like that.I asked what I can do to excel at my job.Answer is 39.6 to 53It seems to me that I should see the great man aka talk to the boss and volunteer more. I also think that the yi is telling me that this is mostly in my own mind and not to push it as progress will be gradual.My job is boring and I am still depressed in general but it is a stable job that is fairly easy and pays quite well.

Tried to meet about 3-4 times but schedules wouldn't allow.. and some issues too:  we've ""broken up"" already about 5 times already due to some overt sexual comments he made and some insulting (more snippy) comments I've made... lol!!!!.  I always think I won't hear from him again but he seems to come back eventually and vice versa.  His most recent email he sent a week after I sent him an email (which I was not snippy in at all).  He wrote:  ""I am currently hunkered down in work mode, and contemplating becoming  a monk.  Hope you are well.""  I wrote back:  ""Well, I'm sure you'd look stunning in orange.  Actually.. I know someone who used to be an entertainment lawyer in LA and now works very closely with the Dalai Lama.  Let me know if you'd like me to put in a good word for you.""  [we are both in the music business]He more than likely rec'd my email because I know from experience his phone also receives them.  He usually responds right back but hasn't yet.

3671,"I asked the Yi to show me a picture of a plan of action I have and hope to execute (would prefer to keep details private). I am interested in the nature of the hexagrams it gave me. It said Hex 56.4, the Wanderer, and then Hexagram 52, The Mountain/Keeping Still.My understanding is that Hex 56 calls me a wanderer in a foreign land or in unknown territory, and as such I must be careful and respectful of the land and people around me. Line 4:  The wanderer rests in a shelter. He obtains his property and an ax. My heart is not glad.L4 seems to say I have to go this one alone/there are times we do things without support and this is one of those times.And Hex 52, seems to suggest seeking a quiet heart AND coming to a halt. But I am not sure that is all there is to it. ""Fire on the mountain:The image of The Wanderer.Thus the superior manIs clear-minded and cautiousIn imposing penalties,And protracts no lawsuits.""So if I go about it clear-mindedly, things should be fine. ""The Wise Person  Does not permit his thoughts To go beyond his situation. """" That seems to suggest if i go about the plan *without expectations about the results* I should be fine.I found an old post by LightofDarkness, who wrote the following: The looking back emphasis in 52 is on analysis of past steps to in some way aid in moving forwards - this is an act of discernment; using past experiences to aid in determining the best 'future' experiences. - IOW quality control.Click to expand...andWhen we add-in basic emotions, 52 correlates with suffering, grief, through the loss of love. It is through that loss, a past experience, that we develop discernment.Click to expand...That suggests to me ""be discerning"" but it doesnt necessarily say do not act. Right?Does anyone disagree? Is there any way the Yi is saying not to pursue this plan?"
3672,"Good Morning,A man I have got to know in a kind of work relationship (it is complicated) but also on a more social level (lately) Is putting out some very weird (to me) vibes at the moment.His attitude toward me moves from very friendly and almost chivalrous to down right argumentative and almost aggresive! I'm not frightened by him, I actually quite like him as a person and almost find him oddly attractive at times, but he is so changable, being very criticle at times and at others complimenting me in a kind of back handed way. Then talking to me and then ignoring me etc. Just can't make it all out. He is about 11 years older than me and as far as I know lives with a woman. He just seems to have quite intense reactions to me and it is bugging me.So, I consulted asking 'What role am I playing for him?' and recieved Hexagram 32 lines 1/2/3/4 changing to Hexagram 24! He also at times seems to be obsessed with my physical appearence. What clothes I am wearing, even how much they cost! So I consulted asking 'How does my physical presence affect him?' and recieved 34 lines 1/2/4/5/6 changing to 53.I can't really relate them to my questions and wondered if someone can maybe give me more insight?Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!"

It was also closer to home and had other practical advantages over my current position.At the same time I was really trying to get to grips with Yi and, using the sixteen token method, arrived at what appeared to be a fortunate hexagram 58 unchanging. But although I got an interview I did not get the job. I was devastated by this and could not understand how to reinterpret 58 which would have given an indication that that would have been the outcome.The same job recently came up again and I decided to reapply - this time I did not even get an interview.So I would like to have some help in understanding how 58 was a true indicator that I should apply for the job, when I did not get it and felt so depressed about it afterwards.

He, however, thinks that 21 line after line show a clear sign she is married since the hex speaks of ""breaking the rules"".Which, of course, is possible.For me, however, 57 is confusing in this context: after 21 speaking, line by line, of biting through, facing the obstacles energetically, etc., there comes a hex speaking about gentle approach, gradual, inconspicuous effects.The question, I remind you is not about actions but about obstacles.Any insights would be helpful.Thank you a lot."

3680,"I've used the I Ching as a sort of mentor since I was a teenager. It has helped me through some tough decisions in my life and has provided guidance that was wise and probably superior to what I could have received from any human teacher. I started a company after I graduated from high school and I've been working at it for the past 19 years. It's grown well and I've benefited nicely from it. However, things have begun to slow down due to the spotty economy and I'm exploring the possible sale to a larger company. Tonight, I consulted the I-Ching and asked, ""Should I explore selling the company in earnest?"" I received hexagram 47 with four moving lines (the top four) which changed to hexagram 18. Based on my reading of the hexagrams, 47 is K'UN or ""Difficulty"" which appears to advise me to not explore any sale. However, the hexagram changes to 18 which is KU or ""Decay"" which seems to imply that planning properly will lead to an auspicious conclusion. I'm a bit confused on the changing hexagrams. Is the I-Ching advising me to stay with my company and continue working and investing in it? Thanks."
3681,"I was just surfing the archives here, and the web, looking for interpretations of a particular hexagram, when (as usual), I tried LiSe's site to see what hers would have to say.

I've been trying for about fifteen minutes now, through my history, through various search engines, front door, back door and all around the town and NOTHING!!  Oh, I've concerned now.  So I asked the I Ching:What happened to LiSe's site?!I got:39. TroubleLine 1:Going through trouble, arriving at improvement.Going through this trouble helps improving the situation.Line 2:The king's official causes trouble. The trouble is not his personal intention.Being given trouble by someone. This is not on purpose.5. WaitingWaiting. Have confidence in the sunlight. Progressing. Persistence brings good fortune. It is beneficial to cross the big river.Waiting for something. Be patient while what you are waiting for is still likely to happen. As long as you don't forget about what you are waiting for, things will go well. When the moment is there, do what you got to do. (The availability of sunlight denotes the time that it makes sense to wait, like until the end of the day, or perhaps until rain clouds obscure the sun.

3682,"Thanks to the help I got with my previous post :bows:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=5821and a download of the advanced course, I was able today to calmly just ask one question of the iChing with some focus.  So I asked the iChing 'what is happening with the situation between me and X?  Please give me an overview'.I liked the answer but I just don't really know what it means !5 - waiting, nourishment.  The hexagram talks of perserverance bringing good fortune and it being good to cross the great river.  I'm not sure how that relates to a 2-person dynamic - if it were just about me I'd say 'great, I'll step outside my comfort zone (cross the great river) and trust my heart on this one, perservere in my totally illogical but heartfelt belief that we could have a future'.  But it's not about me, it's about the situation and of course the other person has free will etc so I don't really know how to interpret this.The lines speak of a lot of good fortune apart from the 4th, which says 'get out of the pit', and the sixth intrigues me with 'three uninvited guests arrive' but if I honour them there will be good fortune.  I could think of two of the guests - doubt and fear, or am I totally wide of the mark there?  Is the 'pit' my pit of intellectualising?56 - the wanderer.  As the relating hexagram, this presumably refers to me because I'm a little adrift at the moment, just trying to do my own thing as much as possible, get on with work but quite unsure of a lot of things.  Again it talks about perserverance and success through smallness.  To me the smallness suggests not doing any bold gestures to try and change the dynamic, but maybe in small ways something could change and there would be success.I guess where I'm conflicted is that I can see my own personal dynamic here but I don't really see what it means for the dynamic that exists between us, and it was a general overview that I asked for.  Does the reading mean that we're both sort of sitting back and waiting for another time?  I would never usually hope or believe that if someone breaks up with you they could come back but this guy has turned so many of my preconcieved notions totally on their head at a very deep level that I don't have any reference point any more  .

3683,"Dear Clarity friendsI think I would need you help on this.The situation that's been bothering me is that I've recently been romantically involved with someone and the whole affair is full of difficulties and setbacks etc. Last time we met, a couple of days ago, we had an argument over an issue which I consider to be serious and there is now some estrangement between us. So I asked the Yi for some clarification and when I posed the questions, I was ready to accept even negative answers. Usually, when it comes to matters of the heart at least, the answers can be interpreted the way the inquirer would want to and the message might not be understood. But I was really ready to listen. I posed three questions. The first one was: ""Describe the situation between us now"".I got 28.2,4 > 39. My short interpretation is that it is a crisis situation, something is excessive (not sure what), the situation needs to be changed. The lines point to rejuvenation and new growth - I'm not entirely sure what the message of line 28.4 is. The second question was: ""What will be the outcome if I persist with this person, what are the prospects in this case"". I got 3.2 > 60. What I understood is that there are so many difficulties because it is only the beginning of the relationship, things haven't stabilized yet, I have to be cautious about making any movements, order and clarity will come. Line 2 seems to be to be describing an actual situation that I will encounter. It seems less abstract than other lines in the Yi.Finally, my last question was: ""What do I need to know now"". I was asking the Yi to really tell me whatever it felt I should know and I got 36.1 > 15. I posed the question last night and as I'm not so familiar with all hexagrams, my quick and broad interpretation is that I have to expect some real difficulties for the time being, I should persevere in what I want abiding by my principles at the same time, but I should not let my feelings or my thoughts show. Overall, I think that the Yi is telling me that it is worth persisting with this person but things won't be easy for a period of time. However, do you more experienced users of the Yi think that I'm misinterpreting the answers? I'd really like to know if I should just forget about the whole thing and move on. In any other case, I wouldn't have been bothered but he is someone that I like a lot in a way I haven't for a long long time so I'd like to give it a go if there's potential. But I'm not in love (yet at least) and this would be the best time to move on -so I'd really appreciate anyone's help with interpretation. Sorry for the long post.el_2"

Knowing that my girl has difficulty expressing her thoughts in speech, tonight I asked the Yi what my daughter's feelings are about her dad and I having separate homes, and got the answer:44.3-6Could this mean that she wants to talk about it, but is intimidated (by me?) or doesn't know what to say?"

3689,"Hi allI'm new here, first post so I'm hoping for some validation on my interpretation of my reading.  The situation is that I was in a relationship for some months, it broke up but we have to continue to work together (fun eh ). I had not seen the person for about 4 weeks but the two of us had to have a meeting together this morning.  For some reason I'm having difficulty coming to terms with it being over and I'm not moving on quite as well as I'd hoped.  We always got on and continued to get on after our breakup until I decided I couldn't do the friends thing and asked for any non-professional contact to be stopped. (The other person is having some emotional issues and although we broke up I continued to be there for him on a daily basis as I felt he was quite vulnerable.  However it was getting to me too much and I felt I couldn't be there as a friend when I felt so much more).Anyway, I consulted the iChing to ask how I should approach the meeting and got 35.2.4 changing to 4.  My interpretation of 35 was to be myself and to conduct myself with dignity because that's the level we always related on.  To me it meant not trying to plan how I'd be, not try to put on an act, just to be myself in the moment.  I also interpreted this to mean that if I did this, it would bring about some progress for the higher good (whatever that is!). Then, the relating hexagram, 4, to me meant that the other person may not know how to be in the situation.  For me the relating hexagram is like a further insight into the primary one, so that reinforced my decision to just be natural in the meeting and show the other person that I wasn't going to play games or make things awkward.The meeting went well in so far as we got on as well as ever and it was almost like old times.  However, I guess I'm doubting the quality of my question because it's now left me feeling like the connection has been re-established because we got on so well, yet I still feel that I have to accept that the relationship is over  .The reading has just left me wondering if the 'progress' of 35 is something to be hopeful about for the relationship, because prior to the meeting I'd rather hoped that it would be 'progress' for me accepting the situation and getting over the relationship in some way.  It seems though that me being myself has re-established some kind of closeness and familiarity.  I don't want to have false hope or anything, but my experience of 'progress' today definitely wasn't on the level of closure and acceptance for me like I'd hoped!  If anyone has any further insights on this I'd really appreciate it.ThanksApplegirl"

So I asked, what is the significance of his gift to her?Considering she did not hide it from me, and he doesn't seem guilty, it's a mystery to me. I know I should ask him but this is not the time for accusations.So, the iching probably gave an answer, but am not sure what it says. Anyone with interpretations would be good.

On the other hand, even the city mayor comes in because she loves his work. And he has a set of skills that would be difficult to replace in the short term.What's the best action for X to take about Y's behavior? 59.5-4.Lay low and get more information? Let him implode upon himself? "
3696,"Hi, I wondered if someone would kindly show me that I am on the right path!I asked which would be the best way to approach my work for my up and coming exam. I got 64.1 before completion moving to 38 opposition.64.1 He gets his tail in the water. Humiliating.a)Its quite worrying. I think 64.1 is telling me not to go at it with all enthusiam as my high expectations will amount to ruin! Ultimately whatever I do, I will only achieve little success. or b)perhaps it is saying that the best approach would be to try not to over extend myself and concentrate perhaps on a just a few subjects as opposed to all and then I will achieve success ?If a, then I am thinking of asking what the outcome would be if I cancel the exam somehow, and take it at a later date, (though this is not ideal).The obvious thing to do would be to put the Iching down and do some reading! But I just wanted to know how to maximise getting the best out of my studies! "
3697,"Hi again, would love some insight into my reading34.6 to 14I asked the Yi ""how do i heal from a past painful experience.(one that I believe is blocking my self-growth and causing me to repeat unhealthy patterns), and one that involves self-forgivness that has been hard to come to terms with.34 The Power of the GreatLine 6 changesThe sixth line, divided, shows one who may be compared to the ram butting against the fence and unable either to retreat, or to advance as he would fain do. There will not be advantage in any respect; but if he realize the difficulty of his position, there will be good fortune.or, translated ""He is unable either to retreat or to advance: this is owing to his want of care. If he realize the difficulty of his position, there will be good fortune: his error will not be prolonged.""seems to be a matter of unraveling things slowly??? moving to 14 Possession in Great MeasureThe great image says:Fire high in Heaven: great assets. The noble one by terminating evil raises good, by yielding to Heaven relaxes in fate.The trigram for heaven and that of fire above it form Ta Yu. The superior man, in accordance with this, represses what is evil and gives distinction to what is good, in sympathy with the excellent Heaven-conferred nature.Thanks you!"
3698,"My first post!I asked if my ex would return to me. I broke off the relationship because at the time, I decided that my ex was not up to scratch. I was also stressed about other things aside from him. I was brutally honest about his flaws and now he has practically disappeared. Now I wonder if one should accept warts and all. I got :10. Lu Treading with moving lines in:2nd: Treading a smooth, level course3rd: A one-eyed man is able to see, A lame man is able to tread.He treads on the tail of the tiger.The tiger bites the man.Misfortune.4th: He treads on the tail of the tiger. Caution and circumspection Lead ultimately to good fortune.leading to 37:The family.The Iching has been very kind to me and I can usually understand what it is trying to tell me, but this one is difficult and I dont want to biasedly assume and get it wrong. I think it is saying that my ex is staying away from me now because life is easier that way, that for me to tell him what I thought, is like the know it all leading the one who thinks they can do it all. But well I dont know. I would bless any objective views on this. I'm also confused about the family one afterwards"
3699,"In tandem with my other readings, I am still concerned about my geographical location and how it fits into my destiny. I asked the Yi two questions.  First: show me a picture if I move back to my home country in 2009.Answer: Hex. 52.5.6 and Hex. 7 the Army.Then I asked: show me a picture if I remain in this country in 2009. I got Hex 59 unchanging.My questions are: which is these is ""better""? Hex 59 suggests stagnation which is *negative*. And hex 7, the army, suggests is i move I will need helpers (which I am not sure I will have, truth be told, at least not in the emotional support way i would need).I also found this interpretation for 52 from Karcher: ""This is correcting the situation. You are involved in a great project. Work hard to disperse the obstacles to achievement. Don't think about anything else now. This is not a mistake. In the end this will correct your entire situation. The centre is changing. Be part of it. Direction: There is something immature in the situation that needs to be nourished. Take things in. Be open and provide what is needed.""Which would imply that a move back would be good (or better) than staying put here.But this (also about 52) suggests the opposite:  Leaving behind the habits of self, the pinching shoes, the old ways or the passions which do not serve to further ? in favor of freedom from self obsession.Any insights? (this is the last thread i will open for many months, I promise!) "
3700,"Hello,I have recently met someone and have been dating only a short while and our time together has been really wonderful, but then a bit of a red flag. I feel like it's not big enough to stop seeing him, but I am a little gunshy about dating (i separated from husband a year ago).I asked what was at the heart of the situation between me and this new guy and got 2.4.5 to 45.I am not sure what this really means for me, but I would guess that line 2 saying ""it is what it is... not great, not terrible"". am i off on this?and i have no idea about line 5 and the yellow garment and good fortune.Then 45... I would appreciate any ideas, and thanks in advance, for taking the time to comment."
3701,"Hello,After having had hex 28 as an answer of my current situation, I am suddenly feeling that the wind is blowing toward more fruitful circumstances even if I don't know what they are yet. So I asked:1. Give me a picture of a's relationship with b. Answer 32 moving line 1 = 342. What are a's feeling towards me? Answer 20 no moving lines.3. What are my true feelings towards a? Answer 15 with moving lines 5 and 6 = 53.My interpretation: 1. a is thinking of getting married but is running into it too quickly.2. a is contemplating how he is feeling about me, trying to understand what it's all about, trying to get the big picture.3. My feelings are true and sincere and if I continue to be humble and ""15ish"" I will see a gradual development (of what I am not sure…of my feelings to a? leading to what?)Any of your wise insights would be appreciated.Thanks as always."

3703,"Taking a different tack today because I'm becoming aware that I don't understand how I appear to others. So tonight I asked, ""How do I appear to men, generally?"" 15.4,6-56.I did not ask this because I'm attempting to recreate myself for the benefit of others' perceptions, but that I honestly do not possess a strong sense of myself. In fact, I'm usually clueless about another's attraction, never dated much and then spent 10 years in a marriage with an emotionally distant man who certainly did not offer me positive feedback about myself.I'm no wallflower, but when it comes to how I appear to the opposite sex, I'm. So I thought I'd ask the Yi.Is this sort of generalization question useful? And does anyone have much experience with hex 56? It doesn't sound very warm and fuzzy!"
3704,"Hi allYesterday I cast a hexagram for the day asking something like ""what will the day be like as regards personal matters (not professsional issues) and what I needed to do in order to make the most of it"" and got 57.2,4 (relating hexagram 33 I think - maybe I'm wrong). I think I understood the answer fairly well (although not entirely). So later that day I enquired more specifically on 57.2 (""what were the hidden issues I needed to deal with, what lies under the bed so to speak"") so that I'd be able to move on to 57.4 (catch 3 prey?). I got 40.2 relating hex 16. This is a rather more straightforward hexagram than many in the Yi. It talks about the beginning of deliverance, release from tension etc. (describes the situation and is encouraging if not positive) and there's some specific advice in line 2 (something I have to deal with promptly, if I got it right). Although I feel I understood what the answers were about to a certain extent, I'd appreciate it if I could get some additional feedback from anyone who'd like to offer something. I mean, ""three foxes"" (40.2)? And ""three kinds of prey"" (57.4)? All you priests, diviners, wizards (57.2) throw any comments you feel like. I'll sort them out despite the confusion. It says so in the oracle. [By the way, it seems I'm on a self-development phase with the Yi because as I noted in another thread I got 18.3,5,6 for the month of May re. self-development or self-improvement and 20.2,4 when asking what pattern in my behaviour I needed to change. But the thread here is on hexagrams 40 and 57].Hope my post isn't too confusing.el_2"
3705,"Hi, I'm a newbie here.  Would love some help with the question of ""What role do I play in his life?""We've been friends for a while and have recently taken things a bit further.  We have a deep connection, but it feels stuck...hoping for some insight in to my reading (hex 55 with moving line 4) and hex 36.  I'm especially confused by 36.Thanks!Last edited: May 22, 2008"
3706,"Curious if I am on the right path or not, I asked the Yi, ""How do i need to change to attract my soulmate?""From its resulting hexes (40.2.4 and 2 unchanging), I gather the following:Hex 40 = deliverance from danger by activity. I have to GET out there (which I have not been doing.)Hex 40 says ""South and west are favourable, for those who go in this direction, that of retreat, will be loved by all."" ---> My question is: is this LITERAL? Meaning locations on the globe in the South or West? Bc I am located in the very very north and eastern hemisphere...""...Turning back brings good fortune and makes it possible to follow the middle way. But those with good reason to go forward should hurry on their way. When heaven and earth are released from the clutch of winter as thunder and rain, the buds of fruit trees and every sort of plant burst open.""I am living in a foreign land and the question is always ""is it time to go back"" or stay longer. I want to stay longer bc i feel my destiny is here. Or maybe, I just want to believe it is here? I think this is another question for the Yi. Anyhow, to the lines.LINE 2: Have good clear intention and the ability to really focus and follow through.  be bold and sure of yourself. Not necessarily ""proactive"" but just sure. Follow through. Intend precisely. Know you're worthy. Stay the course. Don't shrink from it or start to think it isn't worth while or that you wont find someone. Do not doubt yourselfLine 4. This one gives me trouble. It reads: Deliver yourself from your great toe. Then the companion comes, And him you can trust.The interpretations I found online said the following about line 4: ""Here deliverance is difficult and fumbled. It is as if a man were struggling to release himself from bonds by attempting to untie them with his toes rather than his fingers. He has encumbered himself with inferior people, and must break with them before he can join with friends who truly share his beliefs.""---> who are the inferior people, in my situation??""...In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people attach themselves to a superior man, and through force of daily habit they may grow very close to him and become indispensable, just as the big toe is indispensable to the foot because it makes walking easier. but when the time of deliverance draws near, with its call to deeds, a man must free himself from such chance acquaintances with whom he has no inner connection. For otherwise the friends who share his views, on whom he could really rely and together with whom he could accomplish something, mistrust him and stay away.""Is the Yi speaking about the people around me, the peoeple of the country i live in as being inferior, versus those of my own culture? I can't really guess what else this might mean.---Hexagram 2 Receptivity. 2. K'un / The ReceptiveThe Judgement:  The Receptive brings about sublime success, Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, He goes astray; But if he follows, he finds guidance. It is favorable to find friends in the west and south, To forego friends in the east and north. Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.The Image:  The earth's condition is receptive devotion. Thus the superior man who has breadth of character Carries the outer world.I gather this says be receptive.SO overall I have an image of the bulk of the problems being in the past, 40 is I am now at a good point ""but"" I have to be and remain open to possibility (line 2) and heed some warning about the inferior people in line 4.Do others see something else in line 4 or in the reading as a whole?Thanks in advance,-e."

3709,"Hi,For those of you who have read my posts before you might remember a guy who I think I may be getting a fanciful idea about becuase there's been flirting of sorts, but he's a charming guy and maybe I'm being naiive...so I'm not sure whether I should do something about it, just to check, which may be more self-damaging than the slim chance its worth...Anyway now I won't really have much cause to see him anymore - though maybe in social circles but I dunno... so as I have his number I am considering texting him, but then he'll know I have these ideas, and may proceed to avoid me/ be awkward if I do happen to see him, which would be rubbish.. So I wanted a general impression from the I-Ching as to whether my hopes are futile and I should move on, without pushing it further...I asked the following:Will anything happen between us?Hex 52.1,3,4,6 'Keeping Still' to 51 'The Arousing'Which could be saying not now but maybe in future?..Should I contact him?Hex 47. 3, 5, 6 'Oppression' to 50 'The Caldron'Which I guess isn't encouraging, especially as in the translation of 'Oppression' it says; 'for the time being outward influence is denied him, because his words have no effect'....Does he have feelings or was he just being friendly?And got 64. 4, 5, 6 'Before Completion' to 29 'The Abysmal' So that's a bit off putting.. I was thinking of texting to see if he had a good night, but maybe I should just forget about it - seems like what the i-ching is saying too - its probably not meant to be..In a last ditch attempt for a little hope (silly human that I am )I asked:If I text him would he be responsive/ pleased:52. 2, 6 'Keeping Still' (Again like before!) to 46 'Pushing Upward'..So I guess it all speaks for itself - but any commentary would be welcome (as always) Maybe I'm missing something positive from any of these answers? ...Though I guess I should probably leave it for now anyway...Thanks :bows:"

Could anyone advise or lend their insight? It will be appreciated, thank you in advance *edited, thanks to steve*Last edited: May 20, 2008"
3712,"Ok. So I have known this person for a while now, and since we've met we have both felt a very deep connection, very storng positive energy. Lately, life has not allowed him to be around me very often and I have been consulting the I-Ching for guidance through this period. My question was ""what will happen if i wait for him to resolve his issues"" and I got a 28.5 changing to 32. I would love any interpretations of this reading. I am trying to understand more clearly."

3714,"I decided to ask the I-Ching to give me a symbol for the management company that takes care of my house also also because we are friends with the lady that's running it. Got 25 changing to 47. From what little I understand after having read all the possible threads about 25 it could mean that this company/lady is happy-go-lucky, gets anything she wants out of nowhere just because of her way she deals with people, and yet there is no follow through, leading to lots of communication problems. Am I right?"

3716,"Hello all. For those of you who remember, my last post was about a old acquaintance whose birthday I wanted to acknowledge. And, as far as the Yi goes, I seem to have made a decent choice. HOWEVER, I have some follow-up questions now.Because since the bday msg, I sent a short but honest note asking if he would like to mend and/or rebuild the connection. He hasn't responded yet, but he's been visiting my blog lately for very long visits. I know he's considering every angle to his answer. So I asked the Yi a series of questions. I know you all can help me!Show me a picture of his feelings for me now: 51.4-24 (twice, different days) and 51.3-55How can I help him get unstuck? 58.1-47What does he need to get unstuck? 4.6-7What does X want from me right now? 7.1,5-60What does X want me to say? 23.6-2What does X want from the relationship (yes, I'm using the word ""relationship"" rather broadly here)? 53.1,2,4-1If I ask if he still wants to keep hearing from me? 40.2-16Show me the little foxes! first: 55.2-34second: 52.3,4-2third 24.4-51Anytime I ask the Yi if I should give up or never contact him again have been met with images of a mopey tortoise and the fool.  So I suppose I'm to keep the faith. This is an odd set of circumstances between us, and some very profound questions must be answered--by both of us--before either one of us would be ready for a serious romance. In the meantime, I'd like to develop a better friendship. And the YI seems to be saying ""press on, gently."" But how to press on? And when?Any discussion/help you can share with me would be muy bueno!"
3717,"I wrote in an earlier thread about someone I tried very hard to save from their chaos.  While this person battled their addiction, they dragged me under with them.Today this person said to me: ""You were right, about everything we fought about.  I'm sorry I couldn't see it because of my addiction.  I'm working the 12 steps now... and I came to the step about making amends.  I'm so sorry for all the chaos I added to your life.  What can I do to make it up to you?""All I said at the time was, ""Thank you for saying that to me.  I'll need to think about it.""I asked the oracle for advice: ""what is morally equitable for me to do to have this person's amends in my life?"" and got 38.3,4 (opposition) > 26 (taming power of the great).Here is the way I interpret the reading.  38.3 warns to endure suffering on behalf of the right person, but not on behalf of the wrong person.  38.4 says that after isolation, one meets a person with a positive, heartfelt connection.  26 describes winning the day because one has strength of character.I think this means: quit looking to give more to a person who is still struggling to battle their addiction and inner demons.  Don't get involved in that fight.  Leave it to this person, their program and sponsor.  When I withdraw from this person, I make room in my life to meet more constructive people.  These new people will be positive influences for me from the start.  The new people will have good character, it will be easy to get along well with them, and this will lead to enduring success between me and them.I think I should tell the 12 stepper, ""To make amends, please just don't introduce any more of your chaos into my life.  The restoration I need will come when I get to spend me time with people who are already healthy.  I wish you success in your recovery, but I shouldn't try to be part of it any more.""I risk that 38.4 says the isolation was because the 12-stepper is really a good person, but their goodness couldn't be reached because of all the problems.  When the problems are gone, this very person will be the wonderful inspiring connection worth investing in (38.3) because of how they build me up (26).  But I don't think so.  I think I'm being told to cut my losses.  This is hard for someone who really wants to be loyal.This whole topic is a major concern for me, so I would welcome further perspectives."
3718,"I'm not sure if I've mentioned this before, but I am facing some major health issues.I asked the oracle, what is the most important factor for me to be healthy?24.3 turning point > 36 darkening of the lightThis is scary.  24.3 says there is something that keeps derailing my progress every time I start to get somewhere.  36 says this will be very bad news if it keeps up, because someone in authority undermines my progress.I already talked about sacrificing to try to help someone else's disastrous life.  I believe this is what the oracle refers to - when I let this person become the authority over how I take care of myself.My follow up question, what is the best I can do about my health ASAP?46.2 pushing upward > 15 modesty46.2 make a small positive change and it will add up15 balance and perseverance win the dayThis seems more positive.  For example instead of studying every nutrition book I can find, just have a healthy next meal, then a healthy meal after that.  Over time, these little things will make all the difference.So I am worried, but hopeful.I'd welcome comments about the oracle.  I already have enough information for now about the medical side of the situation."
3719,"Can I trust the apparent positive change of heart from the person who's been such a problem in the past?29.5 > 7Yes, this person is now able to pull back from the brink before their problems spill over into my life.  As a result, they can get the help they need from their own team.  I can expect that their issue will not make any more chaotic floods for me."
3720,"This only slightly relates to my other thread so I thought to separate it, as it is a different question.I recently met someone who awakened more than just feelings in me but several personal realizations. I have doubted from the outset that this person and I have any future together based on various factors I won't get into here, but I am curious why he appeared in my life and if I am seeing him for what he really is. I asked the Yi two questions:1) What should I be aware of regarding this man?44.1.3.4.6 and Hex 60 Limitation.Given that 44 -- with all of its wide ranging interpretations, I did read the archives on this Hex -- can be negative or be seen as a warning, I then asked:2) What does he want from me?Hex. 1. Lines 2 and 6; Hex. 60 LimitationI note the theme of limitation in both answers. And the flashing red lights with four changing lines in hex44. As I understand it, the first reading means (to quote Hillary  )""something important arriving, needs a special kind of attention."" I found online that Hex 44 can mean ruin, or something life giving. ""Everyone needs challenges, to awaken the senses, in order to feel fully alive. And who knows what may manifest from it? What 44 represents is that which is powerfully attractive to the ego. It can be a person, an event or something you have unwittingly put into train, which takes off out of control and far beyond your plan.""That perfectly describes how this person is, what he is, in my life. Kind of a flame but I'm not sure if I am supposed to stay away, and if so, how far away.Line1: you need to constantly be on guard.Line3: If you are careful, you wont suffer.Line4: ??Line 6: be careful...Hex 60, I take just as limitation.As for Hex. 1's changing lines, I understand them to mean:line 2- your light is seen and you can move on to create with more support and acclaim.and line 6- but dont go too far. (But i asked what HE wants from me?)If anyone has insights, I would be most grateful.-e."
3721,"Recently the theme of past issues has arisen in my life. To see what is going on, I asked the Yi several questions, as follows. Ive included my guess at the meaning after each one, and would greatly appreciate further input.1) What do I need to understand?Hex 3 Difficulty at the Beginning. Unchanging. No lines.I am having difficulty getting out of this rut, something is holding me back (duh).2) How can I transcend my past?31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing) – line 3. and line 5. Then Hex. 16 Enthusiasm.line 3: Do not follow your heart or your animal instincts, follow your head. (notes on that hex   Usually people do not want to hurt, they influence with the best intentions. They just don't realize how much self-interest these intentions contain. So be careful. A nice kiss can in the long term turn out to be a nasty bite. Don’t blame the one who did it, just never do anything that does not agree with yourself.3) How can I release the pain from my mother?38. K'uei / Opposition = changing lines 2 and 4, AND HEX 3.""When the situation looks hopeless, that is the time to stand by your convictions, true to yourself above all else. Do this and it will end well. Find a fellow-spirit in the enemy camp and, together, attain the goal. Deeper friendship will grow between you and misunderstanding will cease. “That seems to suggest finding a friend for support but outsiders cannot help me change the pain inside ME. I have to do that on my own, and I am seeking ways to do so.“Treat others generously in order to turn conflict and suspicion into shared success. The differences between opposing views can be small: look for ways to unite them constructively and harmoniously. Disaster can be avoided with care.”LIne 2: This is an accidental encounter, possibly between people who have not been on speaking terms for some time. But the street is narrow and there is no way they can avoid one another. Friendly relations are re-established.Note: my mother isn’t accidental! I think the Yi isn’t speaking to my question but is speaking about a young man I just met? Although we are speaking… I don’t get the significance of this line.Line 4: Holding oneself aloof from the crowd because one cannot agree with their standards and beliefs, one becomes lonely. One is then particularly vulnerable and an encounter with someone who seems to share one’s isolation can assume an exaggerated significance. However, if one is aware of the dangers inherent in the situation it can be turned to the best advantage and there will be no regrets.?? I cannot see how this answers my question.4) What is a general diagnosis of my romantic life now?Answer: Hex.28 3.5. and Hex. 40 Deliverance.Line 3: a man who insists on driving ahead & takes no advice from others; tries to force his companions to go along with him. Resenting this, they refuse to give him their support. The burden steadily increases and catastrophe is the only outcomeLine 5: Blossoming, the old tree exhausts its powers and only brings its death nearer. An old woman may marry again, but she is barren and no children will result. There is no evil in such a situation, but equally, no successful outcome. conclusion: Basically I have no hope?

3726,"I have a house on an island that I would like to sell...have had it on the market for some time and still nothing. A while back i asked the i-ching about it and got 63.1.3>8 At first I thought -and this could be an oversimplistic interpretation - that it meant to leave things as they are, not to proceed hastily, but to keep an eye on the situation rather than just let the property management company do their thing. Is that what it means, or is there some hidden agenda, which I didn't get?"
3727,"Hi, it's me again...I asked the Yi if it thinks it's helpful for me to ask a question I have in mind( I was precise about what in my question to the Yi) and got 22 moving lines 4 & 6 becoming 30 and I think it tells me yes, it can be helpful. The feeling I get from the answer is something beautiful and light might come out from that (not the heavy no answer I was expecting as I have been bothering the oracle with this issue many times before). However, I might be wrong so your expertise is most appreciated.Thanks in advance."

I've read slightly differing takes on 11.4 and wonder if anyone has any insights?  Thanks!"
3730,"Hi EveryoneI am pretty new to the IChing and have been in a turbulent relationship that I won't get too much into detail with. It is the on-off type, but yet the feelings are still strong. Now I have done a few questions and was wondering if anyone could offer any clarity on my own interpretations on the hexagrams.Essentially, I asked a couple of questions - Is this person 'the one' and received a 22 with the 4th changing into hexagram 27. I would assume that it means that I am addicted to their beauty or something else about their personality/sexuality/beauty? Again, the hexagram appears to be a positive on, but I think that for me, I am wondering how much emphasis should be placed on the relating hexagram.The other question was (as we are at an off-again stage) how to approach this and was given an unchanged 62, which was what I had planned on doing anyway - small steps and observing any oppportunities for reconciliation. Is this correct?The final question was would the next couple of months lead to romance which gave me a 58 with the 4th changing to hexagram 19. This is the one that baffled me.Any hints would be most appreciated..Thanks"

3732,It gives me 2.6>23. How do I go about understanding it?
3733,"Thought I'd pass this mini revelation on here, just in case someone besides myself has overlooked a particular meaning for 63. I mentioned something of 3.3-63 in an Open Space thread earlier. More on that.I was installing a custom pickup in a guitar. Not an especially difficult project but one which requires keen eyes, a very steady soldering hand and a little specialize equipment, and in this case a rather complex wiring and switch schematic. I had everything apart and ready to go, however I could see how this could turn into a real mess, given my lack of perfect vision and fine tools. So I sat down and asked Yi, what's the best way to proceed with this project? 63.5 - 36. Hmmm. I decided to look in the Yellow Pages and hopefully find a local electronics shop to do the soldering work for me, and found one. I ran it up and there, and the husband and wife owners kindly said to return in a little while and it would be finished. When I returned the wiring was completed, and they wouldn't accept any money for the work! On the way home Yi's answers became clear: 63 is someone who is fully qualified, and their offering was indeed a blessing to me.Then I remembered my neighbor and his computer. He had messed it up somehow and asked me to help with it. I was able to clean it up a bit, but not sure about attempting any more with it. I asked Yi, what's the best course of action for both my neighbor and I? 3.3 changing to 63. We agreed to take it to a local computer repair shop, where they were accomplished and able to handle the repair.So if you receive 63, and are not quite sure how it applies to your question, consider: accomplished, a professional, a graduate, or having arrived at a completed level of skill."

3738,"I like having some pot from time to time and asked the I-Ching how this affects my physical body (hormones, in particular). I got 34 1,2,3,4,5 -> hex 8. I read a post which said that so many changing lines indicate imbalance...could you help decipher this? Thanks:bows:"

(I'm trying to get better at that)Anyway then I asked again online (dunno if that's such an accurate or good way to speak to the i-ching?) and got 22-Grace which I also need more of..This is probably a bit of a boring one, with the answer speaking for itself and I probably already know that I'm just letting fantasy take me away, having another crush on an unnatainable boy, cause feeling generally a bit hurt by life at the mo... Thoughts on this or similar experiences would be welcome though Thanks for reading!"
3740,"Hi everyone!First of all, let me clarify.  This is the first time I've cast my own i-ching reading, but I've used a couple online programs before, so I have some passing familiarity with it.  Thing is, I used the coin method and saw that 2 heads, 1 tails were eqivalent to a yin line, etc.  I went and tossed the coins and I recorded the number of heads and tails.  However, when I was tossing the coins, I also, in my head, REVERSED the original set of correlations I had ""agreed"" to and wrote the corresponding figures down as well.  Of course, I discovered this discrepancy when I went to compare what results I had against the ""correct"" correlations, and I found out that I had ""flipped"" them inadvertently.Now, for the purposes of this query, I am making the argument that although I had momentarily  changed the correlations while recording the tosses, I had originally ""agreed"" to the set I had seen on another page.  In addition, before I had tried to see which trigrams/hexagram the results corresponded with, I had ""fixed"" the reading to correspond with the ""original"" correlations I had agreed to.To continue:I asked what would be the best actions to take vis-a-vis a certain person in my life at the moment who I am interested in.  Also, it might be informative to also indicate that I had received two Tarot readings regarding the same situation, and the second one sounded very optimistic while the first reading was guarded to the point of dissuasion.  I had also used an I-Ching program online and had a similarly guarded response.I know there would be a few people here who would say that I'm just looking for an answer I would want to hear.  Those folks would be right.  However, this is the crux of the situation: if the I-Ching (and one might say by extension as a divinatory cousin, the Tarot) are divination methods that might help to indicate certain possibilites to the querent, does it matter if one ""wants"" a certain answer?  Does that inherently change the reading?I know that perhaps this post is much more than folks are asking for--believe me, I feel the same way.  I'm struggling with this precisely because I am attempting to deepen my understanding of the I-Ching.  Readings I had received via an online interface were never really quite as bold as Tarot readings, and seemed to urge much more caution.  In hindsight, the I-Ching may have been more ""accurate"" in reflecting what followed (as opposed to certain Tarot readings).Now, I believe it would also be pertinent to mention that in certain situations in my past where I tried to use divinatory methods to gain some clarity about a particular situation, there were many times where I wanted to hear a certain answer, but I didn't receive it, and when I did receive that answer, it seemed too good to be true.  Now, those were all Tarot readings.  With the I-Ching, it was more along the lines of ""really?  Is it really that impossible/negative?"", but for better or worse, it seemed to be more accurate.I know that all divinatory methods are meant to accompany an individual's own free will and ability to make their own decisions regarding whatever situation he/she finds him/herself in.Why the meandering preface?  Well, because in addition to the blithe prognostications of the 2nd Tarot reading I received, the first I-Ching divination I did for myself was also very optimistic.  Does the same rule of energy apply when I desire a certain response from the I-Ching, that is, does desiring a certain outcome produce a certain outcome?Is this perhaps a bigger issue within myself, where I am ""unprepared"" to hear good news?  Am I so used to hearing the negative possibilities in a situation that I now regard anything even slightly optimistic as being the product of my desire (and therefore, perhaps more influenced than it should be?) and therefore, less ""accurate""?Let's enhance this discussion with the actual reading I obtained earlier: 35.2 (Chin/Progress--35 changing line 2).  Future hexagram: 64: (Wei Chi/Transition/Before Completion).The actual situation:  I am infatuated with a co-worker of mine who I believe is a ""closet case"" (that is, gay, but not openly acknowledging it), and I'm wondering what the possibilities are there for something in the ""romance department"" to develop (and yes, I'm gay).Now, with the first Tarot reading I received, I fear I may have put too much out there by saying that the man I was interested in was a ""closet case"", and I think that any common sense reader--using the Tarot or not--may be inclined to dissuade me from pursuing it.  It would be important to mention that this discussion was held over the phone, so I could not see if the reader was actually turning cards or using her any other avenues open to her (including common sense) to adivse me.  Interestingly enough, the second reader, even knowing that the man was what I considered to be a ""closet case"" was much more optimistic, emphasizing the role of my patience, but that my time would not be wasted in this endeavor.This discrepancy stimulated much pondering on my part.  Of course, the ""neutrality"" of the reader had been in my mind, as applied to either reading.  More importantliy, I was wondering about the ""integrity"" of the divination medium.  Specifically, does the reading change since I ""wanted"" it to change, or is the reading reflecting current realities (the two readings were a few days apart, but there was no indication of a timeframe in either one)?  I have found out through experience that sometimes you definitely do not hear things you'd like to hear, and you have to work with the information given you to the best of your ability.For one, I thought it was a surprise how the second reader suggested it would be merely a matter of patience, especially since the matter of sexual identity is rarely settled easily--but what is the role of the ""rational"" complexity of the situation if a divination may speaks to a deeper, perhaps ""irrational"" truth?Here is my larger question of concern.  In both cases, the cards spoke plainly.  The first reading was not necessarily optimistic but not necessarily pessimistic either--it spoke of obstacles, but with positive possibilities denied for an indeterminate amount of time.  The second reading was more direct in its (by comparison) unbridled enthusiasm.And so we come back to the I-Ching.  I see hexagrams 35 and 64 as being ""easier"" than others.  35 is about a progression of a situation that is in the querent's favor.  64 clearly speaks about patience.  Neither will justify any rash actions but rather emphasize the importance of deliberation, patience, perseverance and benevolence towards oneself and those surrounding you.  In my interpretation, these echo the sentiments of the second Tarot reader, and in some ways, even the first.Interestingly enough, even if I have the hexagrams which would have resulted from my ""backwards"" reading with the yin/yang correspondences flipped, the result would be 63.2: Chin Chi/After Completion and 5: Waiting.  In my understanding of the reading, this would correspond roughly with 35.2/64 with little necessity to flounder over the differences between the two.  To me, both seem to reflect essentially the same ""meaning""--persevere, wait, make sure your timing is correct, be cautious.What was the first reading I received regarding this question via an online I-Ching program?  7.6 (Army) > 4 (Youthful Folly).  Of course, I was not excited about this reading in particular.  To put matters most bluntly, I recorded the following sentence: ""Basically this means I'm going to be unhappy again.""  There is little to be gained by immaturity, youth, or folly in this case, at least in my interpretation, because it awards a kind of cold and lonely wisdom, and at least in my case, that kind of wisdom isn't very good at keeping you warm at night.  I know that this is a gross oversimplification.  In all humility, I will admit that after years of sincere and well-intentioned effort, there is little I can account for in the way of happiness in relationships, but I have gained much ""wisdom"" and ""experience"" with the blessing of having few, if any, regrets in that area of my life. Knowing the natures of the I-Ching readings, their relationship with the Tarot readings, and this relationship with my own sense of hope, any germane comments regarding the entire situation would be welcome.  I remember reading an article here which spoke about timeframes and the I-Ching, and in the same forum there was a discussion regarding time of study and its correlation with the interpretations of hexagrams.  How quickly can a situation change?  How long can a reading be valid?  What experiences have you had regarding wanting a different reading than what you received, and what were the results of such desiring?  As much as I understand or do not understand the oracle at this point, I believe that this post is a reflection of my inner reality regarding my attitude towards the oracle, and similarly, my relationship with any discussion which may arise from this post.  While the words say one thing, the meaning may in fact be beyond, behind, around those words while being contained within them.  Responses to this post may be regarding the nature of divination, the specific hexagrams, my own personal idiosyncracies.  Each person will receive whatever pertinent information he/she may cull from this post and respond accordingly.This post can be burned as fuel, taken as shelter, used to futher communication, climbed to gain perspective, regarded from a distance, analyzed in detail.I guess the bigger question is, am I in a different place now than before?  Am I at the end/beginning/end/beginning or a space between and/or beyond the two?As you can tell, this is an invitation.  Please, share your insights and commentary with me.SageFenix"
3741,"Hi i would really appreciate if someone could give me their opinion on this.I have been ""seeing"" to put it loosley this guy who pretty much mucked me around for months, didn't want a relationship... elusive with answering text etc usual excuses all the time. I let it go on as we got on so well and i really liked him.Last week i finally had enough and told him i was worth more than being mucked about and thought it quite obvious the reasons he didn't want a relationship... so he can see other girls... he didn't deny just said sorry.This week i have missed him but totally prepared to move on. Last night i asked the i ching if he misses me and will contact got 61.4 changing to 10. weirdly he text today.ask how i was, which i ignored, he text again saying he knows it's probably not a good idea we talk but that he missed and hoped i was ok. I replied and said i'm well thanks. then ignored his next message asking what i'd been up to...i then asked the i ching if it was the right thing to do ignoring the message and got 47.1 to 58.I am reading 47 saying I was and should continue to do this, though not sure about line 1 and 58.I really like this guy but the way he treated me made me miserable and i'm don't want to do that to myself again.Any insight on either castings would be appreciated. Thanks"
3742,"My job environment has been crossing me up of late. Without going into too much detail, large sweeping managment changes have created instability, confusion and anxiety among myself and those with whom I work. In addition, my superiors have been systematically undercutting the fair market value of my position. As a result, three or four people have left; two directors were axed, and this of course has left that much more work for the rest of us. Moreover, prior promises of advancement, promotion, and raises have been suspended or taken off the table altogether. I have been question the oracle as to whether now is the proper time to leave, and what the changes mean. I asked the orace three times: What will be the effect of leaving my company?The first time I got #34, Great Power. This changed to #19 Promotion.The second reading I received #1 Creative Power. I had a change in lines 3,4 & 5. Line 5- the ruling line - states, ""Whatever you choose to do is in accord with the cosmos.""The Third ime I asked the inverse question: What will be the result of staying?I received #28 Critical Mass. This is a very strong hexagram for me. I discuss its importance on my I Ching blog, if you would like further detail.The statements in #28 that intuitively resonated with me were the following:""The ponderous affairs of the people around you are pushing into the foreground. The current situation is becoming weighted with a great many considerations. In times of critical mass, it is exhausting to cling to ideals & ignore the realities of your environment. Look for an avenue of escape; prepare to make decisions about your next move.""So, it is pretty clear what I need to do. But change is difficult; part of me doesn't want to leave, simply because I'm comfortable. I become quite sedentary very easily. Also, the reading made me realize that I was harboring a hidden ideal of staying with this Fortune 500 company for life, hanging my hat with them, that all would be well, I found my place, and they would always treat me well.Well, that ideal is turning out not to be true. I can no longer ""ignore the realities of my environment,"" as the I Ching says.Any thoughts out there?"
3743,"I've been like totally fatigued for a long time now (all this year and perhaps as far back as aug of 2007) Got dark circles under my eyes... sunken eyes... feel totally non grounded.I divined a question to the Yi:Why do I feel chronically fatigued and ungrounded? And drew this Hexgram:- - - - __  ∆__  ∆__  ∆- - Hex 32 lines 2 3 and 4 all change to make the next Hexagram The Receptive. What would you all say?I interpret it as being non steady with my character. This is true have been very unsure of my religion went to fundamentalist christianity and then back to taoism recently... NOW- not totally rejecting it but taking a less extremist and more open minded approach. Have also been unsure about my career plans. And... i'm unsure about a whole lot, actually . I  used to know who I am. But i've been a little shaky for the recent years as having to find a career and way of life. But I think at last i'm returning to a resolution on these things. Whats difficult is what the world is demanding and offering and what I want, and really trying to not betray myself to what I want. Or to understand what I really do want... ugh... I think i just need to stick with my ideas as I know them to be - and stop doubting myself. What do u all think? Any insight on these lines?"
3744,"Dear e-friendsI hope you can help me with this.I asked the Yi a question about personal improvement and specifically what the first thing I have to focus and work on is. The question was not related to any particular person but I guess what I had in mind were relationships with other people in general this month. I got 18.3,5,6 relating hexagram 29. I must say I expected something simpler. So I asked a second question asking about what pattern in my behaviour eludes me that needs change and how I can go about changing it. I got 20.2,4 relating hexagram 6. Again, this had nothing to do with a specific person -it was a self-improvement question.I'm not sure if at the time I posed the second question I meant it as a follow-up. But the second question was certainly prompted by the first answer given. I think hex 18 is very positive in the sense that it urges me to act and bring about change and if I do this, the outcome will be favourable. It seems it suggests that I seriously consider the situation before I act. I can relate to what the judgement and the image seem to be saying. But the moving lines, I find puzzling.Hex 20 also urges me to think things through first but I'm not sure I get all the meaning I'm supposed to get from this hexagram either. So I will ask follow up questions but I need to understand the answers as fully as possible first and then go about acting on the hexagrams and asking more questions for guidance. Any help with the interpretations would be appreciated.el_2"
3745,"Hi everybody,I've been using the Yi for a while now, but I still have some doubts..Asking about the future of a potential relationship I've been fighting for 7 months..The girl I profoundly love has been in a long time relationship with another person (many years) but 7 months ago she fought with her boyfriend and at that time I learnt that she loved me too.. but in the end, she decided to stay with the other person.... Since there, I've been fighting to be thrown at least in the friend's area, and thanks to the Yi, I managed to recover the friendship with her.. but now, we fought again..  its really a challenge to be a friend of someone you love that every night sleeps with another man... I tried to forget her but every time I tried, soon I was seeing signals everywhere about her.. like her name and mine in a new shop opening in the town.. incredible  ""coincidences"" you know.. very vivid dreams about her.. etcAnyway today we spoke a lot over the issue and both of us want to be friends again, and eventually who knows if we could have a relationship in the future..I asked the Yi about that and told me Hex. 2.2.6 to 4I understand line 2 as a very good omen but.. line 6 is just  a warning about not fighting again or is what will happen for sure? I think its just a warning.. how funny btw, because we are both Dragons in the chinese horoscope:bows:and the resulting Hex 4 tells me about not thinking so much about this? be like an ignorant, wait for her to make the next move (Hex 2)??added later:or maybe Hex 4 is the background of the situation, in other words, my behaviour..that made fight with her when I was supposed to be firm like a rock whatever she throwed at me?Thanks for your helpDavidLast edited: May 1, 2008"
3746,"Hello there                      I am currently re-assessing what I would like to do with my life/career/studies etc and asked the Yi for some insight. I have been studying a generalist sort of degree for a few years now and I am not really into it. I have finished a major in Japanese already and now have no more Japanese subjects that I can take at uni. I have studied some other languages but none of the excite me as much as the Japanese. So now in order to finish my degree I would have to take a whole bunch of subjects that really aren't my passion. As I have not really been enjoying my course I have taken 12 months off. I planned to drop it completely but I figured I should just take time off in case I wanna go back. I really just want to study more and more Japanese to increase my knowledge of every aspect of the language. Obviously at the moment I can't do that in the degree I am in so I am seriously thinking of doing a diploma in interpreting and translation. I have always been interested in these areas, especially interpreting, and I feel this would give me a real incentive to get my language skills up to native level. I am very keen to start the application process but I am a bit apprehensive. I don't like the idea of starting it and pulling out because i don't like it and I must admit I find all the deadlines and pressure of university study quite stressful. Each day I feel more confident in my ability to handle the workload (and i'm actually getting quite excited about it!) but I guess I still am a bit scared that I am not going to really enjoy it.Anyway, I asked the Yi ""Would I be happy doing the interpreting course?"" and got 41.4.5 -> 10It seems promising but I never seem to be able to interpret the Yi when the question really means a lot to me!I would love to hear some of your thoughts!!!yoroshiku onegai itashimasu!!!u_n"
3747,"I am looking for another job...And suddenly, reading the job offers, I had this idea: why don't I ask the I Ching about the job I have now?... I always ask about the jobs for wich I apply (or intend to apply), but never about the present job. So...Question: What should I know about the job I have now?Answer: 50.2.5.6 > 31Well... I don't like the job I have now. I don't like the boss and the people with whom I have to work. Because the work in itself could be very interesting. I started in January, when I most needed a job. It could be considered a success, because it's well paid. After 2 weeks, I already knew that it wasn't the right place (it's also the opinion of the 2 others colleagues recruited at the same time). The middle manager we had at that time, in January, was nasty. (Maybe the meaning of line 50.2) In March, he was dismissed.

3748,"I asked the oracle a question about my best way to make goals & plans, and got 51.1,3,4 (shock) to 15 (modesty).My interpretation is:Like a lightning strike, a fresh point of view can arrive in an instant and clear the air.As long as you keep a firm grip on what is really important, you'll laugh later about the surprising change.What's important is to use the new idea to inspire immediate action, rather than inner pondering and stagnation.

3751,"Hi allI've read various postings in this site and I've seen that people often ask questions about other people's feelings, thoughts etc. This is not the way I usually pose questions. Usually I ask a ""How do I..."" question. Anyway, reluctantly, I decided to give it a go and asked ""How does X feel about me?"" and got hex 61.5, relating hex 41. I say reluctantly not because I wouldn't want to know but because when I read the answers the Yi gives me I automatically feel it is talking to me. So I got quite confused and don't know what to make from the answer. I'd appreciate any insights and I'd like to ask what people think. Is this really a good way to pose questions? I don't know if I'll ever try this again although it is very tempting.El_2"

3753,"Hi ,I’d like to hear how do you see what I got .Q: what should I know about him.A: 14.1.3 > 64Him, is a relative of mine with whom the relationship is not good. Actually there is no communication between us. It’s a relationship that affects me emotionally in a bad way and I’m trying to solve the whole thing for my own welfare .14.1.The way I interpret this reading is that is not fault wanting to somehow cut any bonds with him or allow him to affect me emotionally.  14.3 “small people are not able to do” makes me thing that the thing I expect from him maybe  he is not able to offer for his own reasons. Brand’s interpretation talks about possessions that one don’t offer but wants to keep for himself and literally is a part of the conflict we have with this person (me and some others too) but this is not the core of the problem. 64. “Thus the superior man is carefulIn the differentiation of things,So that each finds its place”seems that it speaks about my wish to find solutions or ways to handle that situation and put everything (feelings/actions) in an order. I’m very emotionally biased about that situation and I’m not pretty sure about my interpretation. Any insights /ideas ?Thank youMariaLast edited: May 5, 2008"

3755,"My brother-in-law recently had a major heart attack and needed open heart surgery.  He is now in the cardiac ICU and progressing very very slowly.  The doctors say he would not survive a second surgery if one were needed in the near future.  We are worried he may not survive, so I asked, ""What will be the outcome of his treatment in the hospital?""Answer:  23.5 > 20I'm puzzled how to understand this response.  23 certainly has to do with cutting, and he underwent surgery to repair damage to his heart.   23.5 talks about fish and palace women (? the ICU nurses ? who are wonderful).  Is 20 saying that all I can do is step back and look at things from a distance?  Any feedback would be welcome.  I feel too close to the situation to understand this response (23.5 > 20) clearly.Thanks,Tony"
3756,"I have always when constructing hexagrams used the 3 coin method, since I started 4 years ago, and I was sure that I'd read correctly that:2 heads, 1 tail would be a yang, unbroken line (like 3 heads.)And 2 tails, 1 head (or 3 tails), would be a yin broken line.Only recently learnt about the moving lines,which I thought would be 2 heads, 1 tail (yang) changing to yin.And 2 tails, 1 head (yin) would change to yang.However I read more closely the instructions on this site and shock horror - 2 tails 1 head would in fact be an unbroken line!!?Which means that all this time I've been casting wrong, and every time I've had an answer that has been totally relevant, helped me through my problems and inspired my faith, it's actually been the wrong hexagram!! I could really do with some words to appease me now because I feel quite shaken and disappointed, especially as my last thread (The 'Am I deluded' one) where the i-ching seemed to yield good advice very relevant to my situation, was actually different hexagrams all along!?Help Please!!?

3758,"A friend of mine asked me for a reading which frankly has me puzzled.  She has just come back from a meet the teacher and discovered that her daughter is not doing at all well.  She knew that she was having problems because getting her to do her homework was proving very difficult.  The girl is very bright and social and the teachers cannot work out what is going on. The question was why is she having difficulties in School?The primary hex was 53. Chien / Development (Gradual Progress) with the fifth line changing.And the result was 52 Keeping Still.Normally I would ask a follow up question about what the parents should do... but with the first reading I cant really do that can I?53.5 seems to indicate that although she is struggling she is nearly there -- but keeping still?

3759,"I had a simple idea for a question which some of you may have already asked. But I thought it personified what the Yi was really all about and I thought it might be a valuable thread to open up and allow us to explore who we are. It's pretty personal so I understand if some would rather not participate. The question is this:Can you give me the two most important hexes that best encapsulate what I need to learn in this particular life?Pretty important question I'd say and can lead on to all kinds of other follow up questions. Result: 13.6 > 49 and 46.6 > 18As a very brief summary, I got from this that I need to learn how to work with others - especially in teams - and not to give up my individuality, while at the same time learning not to change others to my way of thinking. Cultivating mutual interest but not necessarily on deeper issues and being happy with that. Always had a problem with finding a balance between team work and independence. Learning all that could lead to fundamental change in perception. And secondly, to continue advancing in life often without a compass, getting used to the unknown and to cultivate endurance,vigilance and trust in my own ability to navigate through the inevitable obstacles. Bit of a karmic feel to it. The seedling pushing up from the darkness etc.  This is intimately connected to past issues, social conditioning, parental influence etc. Anyone else want to play?Topal"
3760,"Hello.I am in the midst of writing a masters thesis and I asked the Yi for some advice concerning my approach to this process.  I got Sun, Decrease, (Hex 41) with a Changing line at the top. This top line reads something like: not diminishing but increasing.  This alternates to Lin, (Hex 19) approach, and the top line is about generous approaching....So I guess this is overall a favorable reading, but I am still not sure how to apply it to the process of writing....any ideas??"
3761,"Pardon me while I explode.   Hey, I feel better already with a smiley.Our business wound up with the client from hell.  They were so outrageously rude and disorganized, chaotic and pushy, obnoxious and intolerable.  We had a team member - normally calm - literally become sick with massive headaches and nausea from the stress.  There were red flag warning signs we didn't pick up on.  But it also didn't occur to us just how terrible some people could be as customers.They were charming personally, up until they started trying to get a lot of extra work for free.  Their new demands came, of course, in a three hour meeting that had them on their cell phones at least half the time.  In these calls, they told off their callers for not being respectful!  They showed up late, and the actual work to be done should have taken half an hour - and never did get finished. We have a meeting tomorrow that they imagine will be to further define the project - like we found out they ""further defined"" for the last six vendors they've had - coincidentally all incompetent, they said!    We've already decided our outcome of the meeting will be to kick them to the curb, hand over what we've done so far for their deposit, and tear up the contract.  They want to have plenty of time and not be rushed!  Won't they be surprised at how much can change in 10 minutes!My business partner wanted to send a scalding hot email telling them off.  I said, let's wait and try to be civil in person.  We are meeting at a public cafe, so they are unlikely to cause a scene. I asked the oracle:Outcome of sending the hot email? 33 retreat, no change.  We give up and stay away.What should I understand about my fears about the ranting hot email? 5.5 waiting > 11 peace.  I hope that with a longer term view, we can have not just retreat but a lasting peace.Is my hope for a negotiated peace realistic? 16.2,3,5 enthusiasm > 28 preponderance of the great (overload).  No, no matter how hard we try to be gracious servants, they will pile on more and more until everything collapses. This seems very clear to me: we need to stop working for them.  Still not sure if email or the meeting is the way to go.(After the meeting from hell, we picked up a delightful new client.  Everything got put together in an hour, they are happy and we are happy.  We aren't too worried about the lost money from the bad client.  Actually, we're looking forward to not wasting any more time with them.)I think the Yi is saying my partner's right: give up already.  Any further interpretations?"

3763,"Hi AllI can honestly say that the last 2 years have been the worst 2 years of my life.  Two years ago my (then) husband and I both lost our jobs within 2 months of each other.  Needless to say our marriage nosedived, although there were other contributory factors.  My son , who has always been a 'hand full', went off the rails and my husband (who always very good with him, despite not being his biological father) found the situation impossible to deal with.  I had 2 miscarriages within a 3-month period.  My mariage fell apart completely and we separated.  We sold our house and ended up with a mountain of debt.  Two good things did come out of the mess which are that I relocated with my son to an area where I knew I would find a specialised job - which I did and I love doing.  It also pays well so I can't complain on that score.  My son has since been diagnosed with ADHD and we have an excellent support network where we now live in terms of professional assistance.Two weeks ago I was presented with yet another bomb dropping from the sky. I was diagnosed with MS - I am still shellshocked.I asked Yi, ""Why have I lost so much in the last 2 years?"" and received hex 16.1.2 to 54.""How can I improve things?"" - hex 1.2.3.4.5 to 27.What does the rest of this year hold generally?"" - hex 15 - no changing lines.I would be very grateful for your thoughts so that I can view translations from other perspectives.  I am not feeling too positive about hex 15, I may add.Warmest WishesClaire"
3764,"Hi everyone-I'm pretty new to using the YJ and have been using it, like I use astrology, as a meditative tool to see other sides of a situation.  I recently have asked several questions relating to my love life, or lack of it.  I have received hex 55 several times.  The most recent question I asked was, ""What can I do to find a loving relationship with a man?"".  I got 55.2.4 changing to 11.I'm really confused by this hex, as I always saw it as being honest and comfortable with oneself who one is.  And I do feel that way.  Heck, I even see myself as being quite a bit of a catch (though, of course, not everyone's cup of tea).  I've modelled professionally (so am reasonably attractive), have had careers in the arts and sciences, play all sorts of music, draw, paint, and cook well, and am the person that all of my friends seem to go to when they need advice or counselling.  But at nearly age 27, I've never had any sort of a relationship, no guy has ever even asked me on a date, nada.  I've even asked guys out (this is a modern world we're living in, I'm not THAT old-fashioned) or tried to initiate a romance in various ways.  I've sort of come to the realization that I might not ever have a true love, let alone a long-term relationship.  I think I'm okay with that finally too, but really don't see why it needs to be that way.  So I'm looking for any advice on interpreting these, as I'm sure there's something obvious I'm missing (especially because I keep getting hex 55!)I know hex 55 is supposed to be a turning point, but where is it?  How would I identify it?  I don't get it.Thanks!  And special thanks to this whole website, this has been my main source of learning about YJ and everyone's comments are sooooo helpful."

Hexagram 61 confuses me. I've read in the forum it is about uniting, but I always thought it was about inner truth...meaning, whatever my gut feeling is about the situation, is most likely true...except I don't have a gut feeling about this one...and I am still a beginner as well....so I may be WAY off.

3766,"hi,i often use Online Clarity to help me with my readings and most of the times i get someone's thread with the lines that i'm looking for and end up not asking for advice, because i get the insight i was looking. But for this one i couldn't find it so if anyone could help me it would be much welcomed.I have a childhood friend and we always hanged out, but we grew in different paths, i becomed more ""spiritualized"", i'm always trying to overcome my limitations and trying to deal with my emotions and so on and although i don't want to make a kind of reset to her head, everytime she asks my advice i try to make her see that most of her problems (mainly regarding relationships) happen because of her low esteem issues, of her not liking herself, meaning i try to make her to see that most of the times we are responsable for what happens to us because we allow it to happen and when our esteem is very weak all sorts of parasites appear. Yesterday i had a big argument with her cause we where talking as usual about her problems and i was listening her recurrent talk and i exploded, i said terrible things to her, all true but in the most cold and direct way and she was deeply hurt. In the moment i said those things i didn't felt guilty nor felt i was being too direct (it reminded me of hex 51, that i was giving her a shake, so that she could wake up and smell the coffe), bottom line i totaly flipped .Today when i saw her it all came down to me, i felt horrrible for some of the trues i said and mostly how i told them.And so i asked the I ching if any good would come of it and it came hex 62 line 3 and 6 changing to hex 35 and i'm very confused caused the lines from hex 62 are all kind of bad omens and then it changes to hex 35 wich is of progress, although the outcome of hex 35 is very auspicious the lines of hex 62 are very bad.What do you all think of this? I wouldn't like loosing her friendship but i don't know, i'm feeling lousy.THANK'SCANDY ROSS"
3767,"Hi. I would really apreciate getting your opinion on these answears from the Yi. I find myself a little bit overwhealmed. I am between to girls, one whom i've been for over a year, and another that i fell inlove with at my working place.I first asked about my current situation. The answear was hex 20 with 6/3 and 9/5Next i asked if it would be favorable to be with the other girl.Yi responded 24 with 6/4Since i work close to this woman but am confuse about what to do, i asked the Yi ""how should i behave towards this woman""The answear was 45 with 6/3The reason why i am confuse is that i don't seem to get an answear one way or the other.When i asked about my girlfriend ""What's the image of my relationship with her"",i got: 56.1.2 which ok seems like a general picture, but when i asked ""what future does my relationship with her have"" i got 51.3.4I don't really know what to make of this.Last edited: Apr 30, 2008"

Fortunately, I found my original inquiry (which is usually the simplest reading) and here it is:If I send a birthday greeting? 55, unchanging.If I do not send a birthday greeting? 46, unchanging.55 appears to be the proverbial double-edged hexagram, so I asked ""Why fullness?"" and got 46.5>48.The greeting's intended for the fellow I apologized to. Haven't seen in him in years. We've been in and out of contact all year but both knee-deep in major Life Changes, so it's been logistically impossible/inappropriate to connect much.

Over the past few months I've lost my job/relationship with my best friend, lost my relationship with my fiancee, and I'm involved in civil court for crimes I didn't commit (no really).My life is completely unmanageable and I've lost everything. I'm having a difficult time right now with how I relate to life and other people. I'm very hurt and feel lost.I asked the Yi the following question as to ""Why"" this is going on?""Show me why I lost everything""Hex# 1, 9@4th - changing into Hex# 9Does 9@4th mean advancing in my life is a mistake?????Regarding my professional life I ask....""Please show me an image of what my professional life will be like for the rest of 2008""I got the EXACT same answer.......Hex# 1, 9@4th - changing into Hex# 9This is rather strange.

3776,"Back again.Today I had an opportunity to try meditation as creative visualization. The woman who led us through the meditation asked us at one point to project a question into the pond in our visualization, so I asked, ""What is my place of greatest service?"" (Looking for a Big Life Vision right now.) The pond began to undulate and then roll, and I had a sense of gestation in the image which I interpreted as ""my place (both metaphorically and literally) is under construction.""So I asked the Yi to show me the reality of my vision, and it came back 53.3,4>12. I'm not liking the ""misfortune"" angle on this reading, but if I read it correctly, I could avoid misfortune if I follow a superior path. Otherwise this reading seems to say that I may have gotten ahead of myself and need to chill a bit --in other words, I think it's reinforcing my interpretation of ""gestation."" Any other ideas?"
3777,"I'm back with a few new readings.Thinking about what ben suggested, I proposed the following question:""What will T most benefit by in a summer school program [read: camp]?"" and got 3.5>24. My inclination is to interpret this as ""She needs to make small advances by having a coordinated team who are capable of reflection and rethinking their approach with her, and understand that they won't be able to discipline her as they might other children."" OR (focusing on her personal benefit) ""T will benefit by growing in small ways when she understands she won't always get what she wants and by learning how to reflect on her choices and behavior.""When I asked the question ""What is the reality of T attending____ this summer?"" I got the following responses:A: 64.1,2>21 (the YMCA she currently attends after school)B: 36.1>15 (the school for gifted kids)C: 60.2,5>24 (a large Jewish community center)Have at 'em! "
3778,"Common sense says that it's a shockingly bad idea to have a free forum where people give away readings and information on a site where I'm trying to sell these things. Meng says things that are subtler than that, but also suggests it does me no good.So the Dispersing (now of my readings journal) continues - Question I asked Yi last month:'What effect does this great free forum have on my business?'Yi says 14.1.2.3.5 leading to 12.This suggests to me that whatever good sense may say, this community has the potential to do wonders for Clarity. Also that it isn't doing so right now, because of 12-ish things (like my not being here enough - something I'm working on!).Line 1    ‘No intercourse with what is harmful,    In no way at fault,    Hardship is thus not a mistake.’Line 2    ‘A great chariot to carry loads.    With a direction to go, no mistake.’Line 3    ‘A prince makes a summer offering to the Son of Heaven.    Small people are in no way capable of this.’Line 5    ‘Your truth now communicates, now strikes awe.    Good fortune.'I'm pretty sure line 5 is in the future.  Also that although I asked for a description - what's going on, how is this working? - in fact I'm also getting some advice on what could be possible if... Ie not just what's happening, but what 'pivot points' there are for change.I could use some outside perspectives on this - especially line 1. Thoughts?"
3779,"Hi again all!Following up on some practical concerns alluded to in my last posting.I inquired of the Yi: ""If my daughter attends X school this summer?"" and got 62.2>32.Should I interpret this as ""Don't expect big changes or great consequences from this choice if you keep in close communication with the staff and administration. It will be similiar (32) to the expectations and circumstances in her current school.""My daughter is very bright, but because she is on the autism spectrum (high functioning), we've had terrible trouble in summer programs created for ""normal"" kids. The teachers were literally unnerved by her--and she could sense that.This school is specifically for ""gifted and talented"" kids and has experience with plenty of odd behavior. It's also expensive--and they don't refund money if a child is asked to leave half way through the summer (a situation we've face twice already).

3781,"Hello everyone I have a strange story for you... At the beginning of the year a relationship I have had with someone turned from being a friendship into something different.  She was in a partnership with someone else and keen to leave.  I was married.  The relationship was based on a spiritual connection and was very strong.  In the end I saw that my life would be better with her. I left my wife to be with her and her child.  I was away from her for two weeks ending my marriage and when I came back something had changed.  Her mother apparently had said she was made for leaving her relationship with her partner for me.  Since she had not had the chance to move out of the house with her partner she stayed there.  Her excuse was that her daughter had some exams she needed to sit.  Anyway I arrived divorced and ready to be with her.  She however was shut down and not going to develop our relationship (at least until the exams were finished).  However it became fairly clear that she was not going to move either.  She got into a state.  She lied to her partner about what we had (made it out to be an internet thing which it wasnt).  She remained in separate bedrooms from her partner and refused to commit to either of us. She sees me most days although we do not have a physical relationship any more.They have just started couple counselling which she hopes will help her make up her mind. Her partner seems to be in denial.  He hopes that they will get back together but is ignoring the the reasons they feel apart. She is emotional, creative and magical he is the opposite.  His idea of an argument is to ignore her and walk out of the room. This is the iching reading I did for her and her partner.  The question was what will happen to M and M's relationship.Hex 38 with the second line changingOppositionOne meets his lord in a narrow street no blame!""As a result of misunderstandings it has become impossible for people who by nature belong together to meet in the correct way.  This being so an accidental meeting under informal circumstances may serve the purpose provided there is an inner affinity between them.""It changes to Hex 21 Biting throughWhen I asked about mine and her relationship...   I gotHex 4 Youthful Folly with the second from the top line changingAn inexperienced person who seeks instruction is on the right path.This changes to Hex 24 'ReturningI am incredibly biased in this so I will try my own reading and see what people think.In Mand M's relationship there is a contradiction of world views that really cannot sustain itself.  She is meeting with me in secret in a way of keeping her spiritual connection until things sort themselves out.  However soon that will change as things have to be dealt with and reform in her existing relationship has to take place.  Unfortunately it is not clear if this reform is her leaving him, him chucking her out or they getting back together and me being dumped.In mine and her relationship we do not know what to do as there has never been a relationship likes this for either of us, and we have no rules to follow.  However soon the dark times will pass, the situation will be resolves and we will be able to return to our spiritual and romantic paths.Any ideas anyone?"

Then I got really sad because I like this guy alot and do not want to run away unless necessary.I asked a bunch of questions to help me sort things out.  Please know I only seek to know what is really best and healthy for me. I am not about changing him or anything like that. Thanks.1 - What effect on me if just totally walk away from him? (No contact, etc.)  59 unchanging.I would have understood this if the questions was about the relationship, but it wasn't. The question was about me. So I guess obstacles within me will melt if I walk away? Does this mean he has been an obstacle for me?2 - What if I try to sit down and really talk through everything with him - really get some answers and express all my concerns, etc.?  2.3 > 153 - What about the idea of just being distant, not totally walk away and end contact as above, but just disengage 8.1.4 > 174 - Please give me a clear sign, is he being truthful with me or not?12.4.5 > 23I am clueless here because the lines sound great, and perhaps the 23 is about nakedness, such as he is being truthful because he is exposed? But I am not sure. I want to believe him and when I am with him I feel that I do believe him. But when he disappears my mind starts working overtime.5 - How does he see me?8.2.5 > 7I know this was a bad questions to ask, because only he can tell me, blah, blah. I also believe I understand the meaning of these lines, but not as it relates to him seeing me. Line 5 certainly is about letting someone go if they aren't coming together naturally. Because of how I asked the question I am not sure of the answer. Does this suggest he wants to let me go? Or that he is letting me go because we aren't naturally coming together? I must admit that I have been so LAID BACK with him, and making NO DEMANDS at all, that he could think I am not all that interested. Then again, he would be blind if he didn't know how I feel. Line 2 looks good.6 - What's going to happen next between us?51.6 to 35Now I know this is all about sex, but I'll tell you, there had better be lots of roses and good, honest, and open dialogue before anything physical happens. This for sure.Part IIOK, there is another woman loosely in the picture. I ask more questions:1- What is going on with them? 18.2 to 522- How does she effect he and me?  30.6 to 18Does this mean I should be the one to get rid of her, or that she will be doing that to me? Assuming it meant me, I asked:3- What if I tell him to get rid of her?   51.1.3 to 624- What if I tell him I can do an open relationship with certain conditions?  42 unchanging5- What approach should I take with him for my highest good?  44.2.6 to 31This is the same answer I received to this same question awhile ago. But in between, I have received 2 as the answer.6- What if I just totally walk away form him?  24 unchangingRemember the other day I got 59 as answer to this question.7- What if I tell him the kind of relationship I would like to have with him?  58 Unchanging8 - What kind of effect would having such a relationship have on me?  2 Unchanging.9- What are his intentions toward me  7.1.2 to 2410- Why didn't he tell me about her?  56.3.4 to 2311- What is his intention toward her? 8.5 to 2Notice I got a similar 8.2.5 to 7 when asking how he sees me.12- What am I supposed to be learning in this situation? 58.2 to 17OK, go for it. Give me your honest feedback. I know I asked a million questions, I just need some help seeing myself and seeing the situation so I can decide what's best for me. Thank you!"

3787,"Hi GuysI think Yi was certainly trying to tell me something last night when I cast the same hexagrams (but back to front) twice!My questions were in relation to my estranged husband who I still miss but we have not been in communication for the past 6 months as we are both trying to get on with our lives.My first question was ""Does he NEED my help?"" and got Hex 62.5 changing to 31.  I later asked ""What does he NEED from me?"" and got Hex 31.5 changing to 62!I have interpreted this to mean that he will connect with me again but not now but sometime in the future.  Funily enough I have received a few hex 19's lately also so perhaps contact is eventually on its way.Just wanted to get your views?Best WishesClaire"
3788,"hi,this is my first post so please forgive any awkwardness or lack of knowledge on how to do things right here....i am going through a quiet but unsettling time in my life right now and trying to find meaning and direction. i have always believed in the significance of names and synchronicities. lately i have been looking at my own name, which is properly 'ly ly' and means 'glass glass' in modern vietnamese but ly also means fire in han vietnamese (or vietnamese version of chinese). this year is my thirtieth year.i asked the i ching today the following two questions and got these answers:1. what do i need to do in this time?: 18.6 to 46.2. where am i at now?: 30.5 to 13.i would like to hear your opinions on what these readings signify. to be honest, i cried when i got the second reading. they terrify me because i feel like i am about to step off the edge and the i ching is telling me to jump!thank you.lily"

3790,"Three months ago, our relationship gave up fighting against his divorce misery, anger, bitterness and disappointment. I was devastated but now I see that it was for the best: the fights have been getting worse and worse between them as the final end is getting closer. We have been in feeble contact ever since.  He has been confused and confusing: changeable, moody, nice and warm then cool and detached, then again. I have been going through hell in between my strong feelings and complete awareness that it absolutely could not work out under the circumstances. And his state of mind, in the first place: along with being furious with her, vindictive and bitter he has all along (I think) been hoping she might still change her mind (even though it has been absolutely clear ever since the beginning of the divorce -2 years now – that she has never been more determined about anything else in her entire life). He has started contacting me lately and now I’m not sure what my appropriate attitude should be. I asked I Ching : “Which attitude should I assume so that we are back together again?” And I got 50 > 49I’ve tried to interpret but it is very confusing. On one hand, 50 speaks of abundance. 50.1 about transformation which isn’t happening because something is blocking it (this is, as I see it, his stubbornness and obsession with hurting/getting her back) 50.2 of my transformation and development which is in some way independent of his and inability to help him But then, I see lines 50.5 and 50.6 as very positive ones and then the whole hexagram transforms into a very violent one 49.How can patience, simmering and caution turn into revolution and melting?What actually is my attitude supposed to be?Thank you very much for your help."
3791,"Hello Folks.I am new to posting here ,but have enjoyed the forum for awhile . I am really amazed at the breadth of knowledge and insight that you all contribute.Here goes:Background-I have been in a long term relationship for 10 years, lots of ups and downs. This winter I've been feeling the need to commit to marriage or let it go. This decision has been really hard as the woman is my best friend and most trusted ally, but the romantic feeling and passion have not been there for awhile no matter what each of us has tried.My Question:How can I overcome my confusion about breaking up/staying with her.I received hexagram 46.1.5 changing to 5. Which seems to be saying keep trying to clear the confusion.Keep the goal of clearing in mind, but be ok with advancing in small steps and possibly waiting more for surety. I feel trying and waiting is what I have been doing a lot of, so this advice seems to suggest staying the course for now.Any insight would be greatly appreciated.Thanks to all, this forum is a great resource!"
3792,"That's this thread, which I freely admit is pretty odd. Owners of 'businesses' are not generally supposed to come out and say, 'I'm not making a living, I may have to pack it in' in public places... it's not felt to be good PR.   Togan just posted to say as much, and makes absolute, perfect, 100% good sense. Also it's pretty spectacularly embarrassing, so the rest of this thread will be posted from under here: :bag: .When the idea of baring everything here first landed in my head - who knows where these things come from? - I thought it was impossible. One of those things it's interesting to imagine saying/ doing but know you won't, not in this lifetime. Still... might as well ask Yi, 'What if I did?'Yi said 59.5 changing to 4. Dispersing and Not Knowing.I think the 'Not Knowing' part is pretty clear. I do not know what to offer that you might buy, and I'm just at that interesting moment they call 'conscious incompetence' of realising how much I don't know. It tends to create a frantic desire to bug people a lot, with predictable results.(I'm going to try to keep the changes moving without bugging you. Let me know how I get on...)Dispersing... well, dispersing the whole 'competent solid business' image I construct so carefully, for one thing, and sweeping away all the blocks to free-flowing communication that created. Also, I had a bunch of plans for what to create next, and those are all dissolved, too. I have one mini-product already done, and the promise of an ongoing membership to fulfil for current class members, and beyond that it's all open water. I'm only just starting to realise quite how dispersed it all is, now. Some major river-crossing going on here.What persuaded me to go ahead and post, though, was the moving line:'Dispersing sweat, his great proclamation.Dispersing the king's granaries.No mistake.'It described what I was thinking of perfectly - great proclamation, great effort (and/or massive nerves!), and a complete dispersing of power and resources - and said it wasn't a mistake.It isn't?  Now this (unlike Togan's post) makes no sense to me whatsoever. One thing I've learned from a few years of readings: following the advice I can't make sense of leads to interesting and wonderful places. (The blossoming of this forum is a good example of that.) So here goes, into the floodwaters. (Anyone got any water-wings?)"

3794,"Hi all! I need help with the hexagram 37!!! First, thank you all for shearing your readings!!! it really helps.last year, It has been a tough year for me. I started up a company with a friend of mine and things didn´t work, it was really difficult for me because this friend betrayed my trust,so I finally took the decision of leaving the company. I asked the i ching If I could find a good job in the next 6 months in the field that I love and I´ve received hexagram 37 with no changing lines. I am single, no family so I can´t understand the meaning of this hexagram in relation to my job question. I really appreciate some help with this!!! thanks again! best, Zume"
3795,"Sorry that this runs a bit long, but it's one of a handful of heavy issues weighing me down until I get a resolution.Someone else was hurt by other people, and put through a bad situation.  I have given up too much of my life, at tremendous cost to me, to help the victim reclaim an ordinary life.  The intention to help was good.  But I did more than I really had to do, at the expense of taking care of my own basic needs.  I asked the Yi for advice.First question: I want to see this person get the help they need, but without their recovery consuming all of my life.16.5 enthusiasm > 45 gathering togetherSix in the fifth place means: Persistently ill, and still does not die. Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant pressure, which prevents him from breathing freely.The person will not die if I do not endlessly help them.  The effort to always be there for them, carrying them or providing CPR so to speak, becomes a constant pressure that keeps me from my own life.Gathering Together shows that both the other person and me can each find our right groups of people to help us.  The other person does not have to desperately cling to me, nor do I have to always be there for them.Follow-up question: How do I get free of the oppression of the constant pressure of 16.5.2.5,6 receptive > 20 contemplationMy life has been made excessively yin - including giving up my powers to think for myself, see for myself, hear for myself, speak for myself.  I've given up the protectively blocking Yang power to have healthy boundaries - to close my heart to destructive negativity that I can't solve.  This is very bad news for a guy, even a sensitive one!and now that has to changewhich is a hell of a relief actuallySix in the fifth place... When anyone is called upon to work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on the utmost discretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should not reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as an effect from within. That's fine, but being this person's servant is NOT my calling in life.  I am not called  upon to work in this kind of position, I fell or was pushed into it!In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to maintain a position to which it is not entitled and to rule instead of serving, it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. That's where we're at now.20 My job is to get my head and heart straightened out by following my own inner light.  My own conscience and spiritual life must be my guide, instead of being buffeted around by the emotional upheaval of others.  Then my inspiration from inside myself is inspiring leadership to many.  The life I should live is to share a unique perspective that helps many people (there's that consulting angle again).  I am not to give up everything to be the humble servant of just one person who really should take more of my advice rather than my energy, time and money (2.6).Third question: This person wants to be a principal in my new consulting venture.  What is the outcome of letting them do that, instead of just hiring them as a subcontractor when I need their skills.5.1,2,4 > 31 This seems like a great big red flag warning signal to me.Final question: and what if this person is a subcontractor only, not a principal?17.4 > 3Flatterers no, helpers yes.  It's OK to use this person as a hired hand, but not to give them an extra set of keys to my desk!"

3801,"My mother is in a senior residence. She is 92 years old with failing eyesight and lousy memory. The director has asked that she no longer go for walks by herself beyond just circling the block. No more quiet strolls on the nearby campus. No more trotting off to the nearby blvd. for shopping. My mother is divestated. All her life she has been unusually self sufficient and also she is unusually careful, so to her this sudden restriction seems capricious and unfair. Unfortunately her hearing and her memory are failing and this coupled with the fact that she has never been one to argue or debate, but by nature has tried to adapt to the needs of others, makes it doubly hard for her to negotiate with the lady in charge. Furthermore, her doctor has not been supportive.My take on it is that the director has her hands full with 50 old people all with varying degrees of dementia and that she has made a rather blanket ruling without closely evaluating my mother's situation. Likewise, the doctor seems to be only looking at statistics and not at the human being. But I could be wrong, or maybe their decision is a little premature but in 6 months the restrictions will be necessary and is it fair to expect the manager to be so finely tuned to the needs of the guests that she has to pick the exact right cutoff day on the day and not a minute before?  We have a woman come visit my mother at least twice a week and when she comes, they do go for long walks together. I think my mother - who's memory is not good - forgets this and obsesses about the restrictions, rather than being able to remember that she can go for walks on the days Mary Anne is with her. Or perhaps  she does remember, but even so walking with Mary Anne is not the same as being free to go by oneself.  I do not live near my mother so I can't take her for walks but we talk on the phone and she values my opinion. If I encourage her to accept the restrictions she probably will. But I sure don't want to do that if they are unnecessary. I honestly don't know if my mother is safe to be out walking. I think she is, but I could be not seeing things this director who has had more experience recognizes.   So now I want to consult the I Ching about this, but I am unsure what my question should be. Any suggestions? I'm thinking, ""Please comment on the situation."" but that seems too general.Last edited: Aug 21, 2006"
3802,"Hi,I don't want to be too long winded about this but I lived with a group of people last year - 12 in a house- during my second year of uni- and enjoyed myself but the majority were already a group and me and my friend found it hard to assimilate (my friend especially) and feel totally accepted by the group - largely due to the elitist/ bad attitude of one guy who probably didn't deem us cool enough (we're quiet shy types I guess) and I personally take a while to feel confident/ myself with people.. especially groups..Anyway my friend was away alot of the time so I intergrated more and made good friends with the one girl of that group - and a couple of the guys kind of - anyway this year, though I wanted to live with them again, I didn't (prob to the relief of one or two)and now live nearby and so often see my friend/ go out with them.However still don't feel 100% comfortable as have had trouble with friends in the past - but have been offered to live with this girl again next year, with another girl and a couple of the guys (one of whom I don't feel I made a proper connection with last year though I like him well enough..)  Initially I was happy about this cause really don't want to have to live with strangers again next year - and I'd like to maintain friendships and I have had fun with them in the past - but I'm scared that I'll be putting myself in the wrong place because I don't feel secure in their general acceptance/ impression of me..I feel its a bit of a predicament but maybe it isn't one really, and I'm just scared it'll go wrong like it has before, and maybe sabotaging it?? I basically have low self esteem but I'm working on it!! I think I'm doubting it now because I've been feeling a little more inhibited recently.. now when I should be feeling more relaxed! ( I can be a bit backwards sometimes..) so maybe i'm being unfair because I do recognise them as good people.. but am I meant to be with them?Anyway I got hexagram 63 - does this suggest that living with them would be the right direction?? I'd very much appreciate an outsider view/ instinctive reaction to the situation I've tried to express... Thanks a lot :S"
3803,"Question: what is the outcome of my pursuing the business consulting work42.4,6 increase > 17 following42 is positive:It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water. Interesting that I did not specifically ask about it, but I have been reading some books about international business.  My business partner and I want to explore the possibility, but we assumed we had to get established locally first.  Maybe we don't have to keep that assumption.42.4 If you walk in the middle and report the prince, he will follow. It furthers one to be used in the removal of the capital.""Walk in the middle and report to the prince"" - that's a pretty good description of a consultant's role, isn't it?  Along with ""being used"" for a big project - a great reason to hire a consultant.42.6 Here is where I have a problem understandingNine at the top means: he brings increase to no one. Indeed, someone even strikes him. He does not keep his heart constantly steady. Misfortune. I am OK with the commentary from Confucius: The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves; he composes his mind before he speaks; he makes his relations firm before he asks for something. By attending to these three matters, the superior man gains complete security. But if a man is brusque in his movements, others will not co-operate. If he is agitated in his words, they awaken no echo in others. If he asks for something without having first established relations, it will not be given to him. If no one is with him, those who would harm him draw near.I understand how this applies directly to sales and service: shut up and listen!  Build a relationship, then have a plan in mind, and only then ask for the order.  Be calm, then we will walk in a calm way to a calm conversation with Mr. Big.I hope that the negative outcome - ""brings increase to no one.  Indeed, someone strikes him""-  is avoidable by following the advice of Confucius.  I am afraid, however, that the ""brings increase"" might be unavoidable, no matter how much we try to do the right thing.I really like the life shown in 17.""FOLLOWING has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. No blame.   Thus the superior man at nightfall goes indoors for rest and recuperation.""  A good day's work being of service, followed by a good night's rest (with no pager!).

3804,"Following up from 37.1.6-->39.Sent letter a week ago; haven't heard back, but that's okay. Really! But I thought someone might be interested in the answer to a follow-up question I posed to the Yi this weekend, ""What is the reality of the situation with X now?""Got 58.1,2-->45. I think this is good, as in ""the best possible outcome for now."" These are novel hex's for me, so I hope I've got the right attitude!Here is dobro's advice for the previous reading. I did my best!37's about family, the inner group, the people you're closest to and trust and support. 39's about hampered advance, the image of which is limping. Put 'em together and what do you get? The guy you're talking about is like family - he's 'on the inside' with you emotionally and psychologically, but all that is 'limping' right now. This is the image the Yi's given you of the situation, but if you apply it to your specific question, then it seems to be saying something like: ""He needs to hear from you that he's 'on the inside' with you, but that the relationship's going through a stage of hampered advance."" Pretty much a matter of stating the obvious, I think.The details: 37.1 talks about being safely enclosed in the bosom of the family, and remorse disappearing. Nice. Tell him that.37.6 talks about how as you capture the truth here, you embody poise and dignity, and how in taking this situation or phase of the relationship to its natural, organic outcome, you have good fortune. Nice. Tell him that.Click to expand..."

Got 55 changing to 34There was fulsome, fulsome debate, with a lot of money at stake (not for me!), a lot of manipulation of facts, many lies - and I ended up having to speak (hadn't expected to) which meant keeping my self firmly under control. I'd say that the I Ching was  spot on."
3809,"Hello again family. I am having one of those times where some answers all needed. So of course I have sought to query the Yi. I have been working with it before this of course, but this matter might need some fine tuned insights. I will explain the situation a  bit. I just recently filed for divorce which is awaiting final judgments. In the meantime I have cleared everything that I could legally close except for one thing, my bank account that I had my wife on. Seeing that her credit was horrible, I put her on the account so she would have the convenience of a bank account. I was the primary holder of course. Well In January I informed her that I would be closing the account a week after the day I gave her that information. Not to be mean I just dont like the idea of floating credit risks. Well with my life being as busy as it gets 3 months had passed by. Just recently I came to find the account to still be open, she did not close it. Much to my dismay I took a 45 minute trip to the bank in the city where my ex lives. Yes she lives 10 minutes or less away from the branch...I closed the account and unfortunately she had a little under 800 dollars in the account, meaning I would have to give her the money of course. SO Account closed I took 40 dollars for my gas expenses, by the way I paid for the divorce out of my own money. Now she has her mother threatening to sue me for expenses she helped out with when we were living in NC so many months ago before all this. As I recall though, my ex mother in law being a money grubber called day in an day out to get the monies back which we pqaid otherwise we would never hear the end of it. So as it goes, the mother in law is saying she will sue for money i don't recall owing. So here is my query: What can I expect from my ex-mother-in-law The response: 48 changing at 3rd and 4th lines to make : 47 As I read over it it sound like the Yi instructs to cover my bases and stand in my power and I shall not be harmed. Does that sound at all right? Thanks for any assistance, my mind is much a mess."
3810,"I've been seeing this guy for a couple months. Though there are some really wonderful aspects & an great connection - there are also ""challenges"".  Some of the challenges have been ""good"" because it has given me the opportunity to show up differently in this relationship and communicate (share my feelings & what I am wanting).  But some of the red flags (issues) tend to be reoccuring.  I arrived at the point yesterday morning where I was going to share that perhaps we both just need to go our separate ways and then we talked and spent a wonderful afternoon together.  so anyhow .. I started w/one question this morning - which lead to a few.  What I would love assistance in .. is your ""overall"" feel.  I don't need each question evaluated. But as you can see there  is definitely a common theme.  I get the sense that this relationship would continue to be a lot of work and probably not the ""soulmate"" relationship that my heart is truly wanting.  Maybe I am living in more of a fantasy - which will continue to leave me ""wanting"" ... what do you think??Can you show me a picture of likely situation of Tom comes to AZ w/me for a couple days?4.1.4 > 38Can you show me a picture of what I cn likely expect of this relationship w/Tom - where it is headed?20.1.2.6 > 60What if I continue to explore this relationship w/Tom?6.2.4 > 20Should I continue to stay in this relationship for now?17.4 > 3What if I choose to stay and work on this relationship?47.4.5.6 > 4It seems that I will always come back to the same ""conclusion"" regarding the potential of where we can grow w/this and left feeling ""it isn't enough""?  Thank you all ..blessings & namaste ..Beth  :bows:"
3811,"I've had a life-long struggle with my mother, and lately with my work demands and HUGE personal transitions, I haven't got the slightest interest in responding to her manipulations. I haven't spoken to her in about a month, which is driving her batty. So today I asked the IC ""What is the right course of action for me in responding to my mother?"" Got 54.4 to 19. I am interpreting this to mean that at the right time, I can move forward with my needs. (I need more emotional independence from her, and I need her off my back.)  Am I on the right track? Or is this wishful thinking? Thanks."
3812,"i updated on the thread ""help, i'm a little afraid of this one..."". I am new to this, and am quite blown away by my experience so far. I believe in it, clearly, or i wouldn't be here. But am still quite amazed at the experience. Sometimes it's literal, once asked what the outcome of an evening would be and got 32. The evening turned into a poker game that went on until 5am. that's endurance... But i am still blown away by this experience so far. I began as a sceptic and have had a couple of profound moments of recognition.I have spent so much time here reading when i should be working, and have been inspired and moved. I have received so much from being here, reading old threads and the ""memorizing the hexagrams"" threads and don't have a clue who any of you are. that in and of itself has been a great help during the most emotionally turbulent time of my life. I have read poems, life experience, humor, and wisdom that have felt like words spoken from a friend. thank you for sharing your insight and experience.Last edited: Apr 11, 2008"
3813,"Why do people send this sort of thing electronically?Separated husband sent a firm request that I decide if we're ""over"". Actually, I think he tried to be clever about it, citing this as a ""limited time offer"" to get the old version and the new version back if I return now.So, a bit off balance here at work (and the students will be streaming in soon) I quickly consulted one of the online ICs for a thought. Asked ""If we divorce?"" Got 35.4--23.This is the most challenging decision I've ever been faced with. I was the one who initially requested the divorce (after MUCH reflection), but I'm still battling my internal ""bad girl"" message loop that says I'm wrong to pursue the divorce. However, on many levels I cannot find compatibility with this man, as much as I genuinely care about him. I just cannot imagine life with him on an intimate, daily basis. We do have a daughter together.Is the IC telling me that I'm missing something essential? Is this a warning?"
3814,"I have been working towards reconciling with me ex husband, and when we split, he thought i'd never come back. he started seeing a girl from work. we've been talking and are very friendly and i am being patient, because he says he needs time and counceling and is afraid of me hurting him. I have gotten a pretty positive reading on our relationship recently from i ching (thanks to you guys who helped me with interpreting). he has said that he can't stay this way for long, it's obviously hurting people. I have had a feeling the last two weeks that he will or has cut off the other relationship. he started counselling, which he was resisitant to, and tells me we have a possibility of reconciling after some time.I sent an email to him this morning, explaining how i am having a hard time knowing if i move on or wait for him but that I will try.I asked the I ching ""How will X respond to my email?' I asked because i thought he'd possibly tell me he's broken off the other thing. I got 41 chg lines 1 3 6 to 46.line three has me in a fit. a third party gets cut. it might be me.but they are not serious at all.  Any indication by the reading how this looks for me? i'm kinda losing it a little."

3817,"Hi. I'm new--here as well as with I Ching--so [pretty please] have patience with me. LOL! I did search first to see if I could find the Hex 1.1.2.6>31--but didn't find it. Background: I'm the type that believes in signs, and I do not believe in coincidences. The last 8 or 9 years have been really stressful on me because I became the sole parent of my children after their dad died. After being pretty much balanced, I went into what I call the ""male god mode"" after their dad's death. Being a Libra/Scorpio cusper it's easy to see how I swung so far. Since Dec 1, 2007, I have been in the act of re-centering, and I'm very pleased with the progress being made. Great, powerful, and awesome things have been happening.On Aril 6, 2008 I went outside to catch some sunshine. As I laid down I said the following, to the Power, aloud:""I just need some Vitamin D...haven't had any in a while and I need it to be healthy. Everyone needs it to be healthy. If you have anything else for me, go ahead. I'll receive it. I'm receptive.""Immediately I received a sign, but I had no idea what it meant, so yesterday I asked the I Ching what it meant. My answer was 1 with the 1st, 2nd, and 6th lines changing, which took me to a 31. The Power knows that when I get three changing lines, I go with the middle one.A Follow up Tarot and Rune agreed.In my opinion this answer is a good one for me. It is telling me that all will be well if I am receptive and correct, and for me to be patient and stay where I am for now. Is this a proper impression that I am getting? Is there something I am missing?If anyone has any thoughts on the interpretation of 1.1.2.6>31, please let me know.Thanks in advance for your help and for being patient with me!"
3818,"Hi, just wondering what the yi says to my question: Should i break up with him?45,2,6 to 6.I know i shouldnt ask the yi yes/no questions but am looking for some guidance because i find it hard to decide. Our relationship seems to be going nowhere and im wondering if i should let go once and for all (benn deliberating for too long) and look at other pastures, so I know what i should and shouldnt expect in a relationship.In other words, i need more experience, instead of sticking to a guy who seems to be taking me for granted without really responding to me as i like it.thank you!!"
3819,"I'm working with my partner on a business plan.  We have our first small customers and are still trying to figure out what direction we want to take with this new business.  We have done the work before, but as employees in big organizations.  We think we'll be happier with a freelance/startup life, but there is a lot to learn!I asked the Yi, ""What is the best way for us to rapidly build our profits?""Answer 53.2,4,5,6 > 32I always start by looking at the stories in the Yi and their morals.53 development over a long term duration, like the tree growing on the mountain53.2 there is a place of safety, like a goose that finds a safe nook on shore; call to invite others53.4 improvise if needed until we can find our own place, like a goose making a temporary home in a tree even though geese don't live in trees53.5 overcome isolation in order to succeed, and don't bother climbing a ladder or hierarchy that isn't really our own path53.6 when it's time to move on, do so in a way that inspires others who stay behind, like people who have a spiritual ritual with the feathers left behind by the goose that flew away32 long term union, successful motion towards a long term goalTo me this reading means:At first, look for a ""safe haven"" that is easy to reach.  Be opportunistic as long as there is some value we can provide right away and get paid.  Take whatever clients are easy to reach and easy to work with right now.  Invite other people to join our team.  Spread the word.  Seek out alliances and advisers.  It's OK if we change direction later, as long as we are friendly and supportive of those who helped us get started.  By acting in this way, we will build a financial foundation for long term plans.I'd welcome any other points of view."

We have been together for 4 months.I just came back from a trip with him as a date to his brother's wedding.He asked me to marry him, so that I can stay. He wants to have family with me. I feel so so happy with him and want to be with him for long long time. But I don't feel it is a good timing for me. I am still so young (25 years old), a lot of changing and possibilities, still want to finish my studies not in US, and work for the career preparation. I still experience and feel how does the energy match between us.I am new, trying to practice my own explanation.My own explanation is that 36 Ming I / Darkening of the lightSix in the fifth place means:36.5 It reveals that this relating now is in a difficult time and light hidden(fire under the earth) situation. The life flow may be against this relating now. Iching gives me some suggestion to protect this relating and other parts of my life. What is it?63 After completion, fire under waterThis hexagram is the evolution of T'ai PEACE(heaven under earth)It implied some danger and risks in this partnership. Water may be over boiling or fire totally extinguishes.After completion, the energy may be collapse/spiral down or standstill or spiral up. Two very different energy together will be very beautiful if they are on balanced, but it required a lot of serious cautions. So the expectation of him as my spiritual partner and lover in the life, it maybe come true. Eventually we will settle down, but the process has a lot of changing, difficulties.Overall, this relating is a learning experience to gain strength, sacrifice, and help the other person.But what does it mean on HEX63 judgment, ""At the beginning good fortune.At the end disorder.""?

3822,"can anyone help me with this ? My situation is that I have been living in quite a remote area for about 4 years now and although I love where i live and its beautiful surroundings I feel as if i don't really fit in. Everyone around me seems settled in their own family network. I am contemplating moving nearer to the city and I am aware that if i do this i would have to let go of what I know to be a lovely place/house.I asked the yi two questions1. Is it in my best, highest interest to stay where I am? 44.1.2>132. Is it in my best, highest interest to go nearer the city? 14.5>1At first I thought it was obvious to go nearer the city but i am a bit confused with the hexagram 13.

Maybe its saying that things are no good socially and that will become more apparent if  I stayed.If anyone can help me with this it would be most appreciated!Thanks in advanceMegs"
3823,"I wonder if anyone can shine some light onto this reading which to me seems contradictory.

I don't like 43 but 45 seem to be positive. When reading about 43 and 45 I can't in any way see how this apply to my question!

I recently decided it was best for me to move on and attend to my own happiness and tend to my son and stop panicking about my relationship. I asked what the future holds for me and my ex and I got 37 Family changing to 63 after completion. At first, i thought, that on present course, the  my family would end up in chaos. We start out ok then fall apart. (assuming that's the correct interpretation) or is that we'll be a family again?so i asked immediately ""what can i do to change this course?"" and i got 63 changing to 37.

Also I am blind so I use my computer for calculating the hexagrams once I have my coins (I use quarters) in front of me on my cloth.Do any of you read the I-Ching intuitively and if so how do you do that?Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!!All the best,Celeste"

I am a little too subjectively involved in this dynamic to know what Yi is trying to tell me. I do know Hex 44 is a woman who is too bold in her actions - and I must add that I asked Yi a few days ago ""What is the most effective way of getting closer to David"" and received Hex 44.5 >50. Again, a bold woman, but with changing line 5. Line 5 denotes a heavenly inspiration and beauty, while Line 6 warns not to use one's strength for sexual prowess purposes. And how am I to read resulting Hex 32 and 50? And, because this is my final kick at the can which will free me of future drama, I asked ""How does David feel about me?"" and received:Hex 58(Joy) 2.5. > 51 ShockI was worried that line 5 was unavoidable, but Willhelm/Baynes specifically states that """"the danger is avoidable, because by nature, the present line is strong enough to overcome these influences"".Now I have to do the work to make the magic happen.LaurieInterpretation is welcome!Last edited: Mar 26, 2008"

I am always using the search for lines in hexagrams function to see if anyone has had a similar reading to mine!Anyhoo I was hoping for some thoughts on a reading i did a few days ago. I have recently been getting a little worked up over the fact that I still have no idea what career path I want to take (I am 23). I am still at university studying a generalist sort of degree in humanities (majoring in foreign languages) but I am really starting to crave some direction. I want to know how I am going to be supporting myself in the years to come.I have been trying to attack the problem by reviewing the results of some peronailty tests I did a few years ago and by investigating careers i had previously overlooked because of a dry sounding name (basically anything sound too manager/supervisor/coordinator-y, anything with one of the 'new' job titles etc.) and also by investigating new ones i didn't know existed.This whole process had left me even more disenfranchised than before i started and I have begun to doubt my self worth, including with regards to my relationship. I made this reading when I was trying to figure out what it was that I have that no-one else does. What my greatest strength is i guess. I guess at the end of the day I was just looking for some encouragement.Anyway, I asked 'What is unique about me?' and got 55.1.5 -> 31While i understand the lines, i am finding it difficult to figure out who is who or what is what...any help would be greatly appreciated!muchos besos!unusual_noises"

Everything will be ok. Hex.11 sounded great: peace etc. Well, thing is the guy has a girlfriend (I can forget him: I won't chase a guy who has a girlfriend). So maybe instead of : Good don't move and he'll come to you, things will be nice between you two. I should have understood. Well don't do a thing, and you'll be peaceful anyway. How would you have interpreted the IC in that case?  Thanks for your insights MousseLast edited: Mar 28, 2008"
3842,"Hi,I just asked if I it was a good idea for me to put a profile in an internet dating site in my own country and pay the subscription (I live in another European country) and the answer was 37 moving lines 2 and 4. To me this look likes a definite yes! But I wanted to double check if you agree with me?Many thanks."
3843,"Hi could someone help me interpret the above hexagrams...I asked if i should go and meet this guy tonight... i have not seen him for about 5 weeks. I still have feelings for him and was not sure if it was the best idea to see him. We have been very on and off for sometime now.On one hand i would really like to as we get on extremely well, but on the other hand i'm not sure if i should since he is very ""i don't want a relationship"". I asked to meet him for a drink, which he agreed and said he wants to see me. I don't think that was the best idea and now thinking i don't want to go and then upset myself.I'm sure if he were to want a relationship as i do with him, then he would have done something about it by now. I think he just wants to be friends, which since i have feelings, I know I can't do.I really want to see him as i miss talking to him. I just don't know whether i should meet him so asked the i ching if meeting him will help or not. I still like him a lot and want him to suddenly decide he really misses me etc.If anyone could help i'd be really gratefull."

3845,"Hi AllWhen you consult the I Ching and ask a question about another person who is connected to you how can you tell if the answer is accurately referring to them or pointing back at you?  I am really struggling with this and I have spent hours trying to analyse the answers but I am still unsure.  For example, I recently bumped into my estranged husband (we now live in different parts of the country) who I haven't seen in almost a year and I asked""What about his feelings towards me?"" Hex 41lines 3 and 4 changing to 14I have interpreted this in several ways:-His feelings for me have now diminished.He has achieved something great by sacrificing his feelings for me.Or, is the answer pointing back at me and not relating to his feelings at all?I then asked ""What about his love for me?""Hex 35 lines 1,2,3,6 changing to 34Again, I have interpreted this in several ways:-His love for me is still strong and flourishing.His strength has carried him forward and he is now making progress without me.Or, is it pointing back at me?!Are there indiciations I should be aware of which make it clearer to identify when an answer is accurately relating to the person I asked about and their feelings or when it is being thrown back at me, the person who asked the question?I would appreciate some assistance as your thoughts will help me to translate my future readings.Best WishesClaire"
3846,"Hello to allI am new here and since now I only read your writings and stuff around web site.My motherlanguage is Serbian, so plaese excuse me for style and gramatical erors.I am fascinated with I ching, but now, few years of practicing it, I understand that there is  a lot of hiden meanings in hexagrams. So I tryed to find group or community where the people are exchanging thoughts and expiriences, and I was very happy to find this place.My question(s) are about job. I am negotiating about one month for new job in an foreign company, here in Serbia, and they, from the very first contact (CV and cover letter), have claimed that I am among the first and best candidates. Due to political situation here the whole thing was prolonged, I was anxious and had many times consult The Book... You know, probably everybody is doing the same...Well, yesterday I finally had The Interview with their HR manager and General manager.Before I went, I asked next questions :1. What can I expect from this job> 42 (5) - 272. Are they (the people I have had spoke with) serious in intention to hire me (as they claimed) or they are just kindly - 14(3,6) = 113. What was the real reason for prolonging thw whole thing and how it affect me? 33 (2,3,4) = 59 So, I concluded that things should be OK.. The interview went excelent, they were very satisfied with my presentation...But, they told me that I should begin working not before 15. April, probably 1. May and that they will inform me, 7 days before start. They just want to wait for political situation to calm down. I am a little bit confused now. I would like to try not to ask The Book every day about the same thing, and rather better understand the answers I mentioned.I would like to hear your opinions about these answers to. Thanks a lot"
3847,"Hello lovely people,So, my crush finally started making moves. I was in a terribly vulnerable place and he approached me and was very supportive!Thus followed several coffees together, a couple of dinners, a trip to the theatre and much hanging out, culminating in 5 hours of the most intense and honest talking (all this instigated by him I must add) He hasn't even kissed me, in fact we haven't even touched really. He tells me that he now believes relationships must start in the living room, not bedroom ( I agree) that I am lovely, and that new relationships must be treated like beautiful buds nurtured into bloom! Then nothing. I haven't seen him or heard in person from him apart from a voicemail returning a call I made first! I have had a daily text with a spiritual qoute and well, that's it! When I have replied...nothing. I am so confused. What is going on here?I ask, 'What role do I play in J... life?' I recieve Hex 1 lines1/2/3/4/5/6 to Hex 2, I know this is rare, but I have recieved it several times in questions regarding him!!!Then I ask 'Why has J...withdrawn from me?' and I recieve Hex 25 lines 1/2/3/4/5/6 changing to 46. Please help. I am blue and feel confused and hurt and rejected "
3848,"Hello, I am new to this forum but I have talked to the I Ching for many years. I have not always understood its answers but it is always an interesting partner to talk to and a helpful one. I have a ""theme"" that has been following me through out the years, ever since I met N I have been puzzled   by the feelings and strong connection I have with him. We do not have any relationship any longer (it ended 2000) but he is still in my mind and heart and we have occasional contact. My reason says that I am crazy  thinking that we could ever have a relationship again, however my gut feeling (and I Ching) tells me that it could very well be possible with time. Today I asked The I Ching to show me a clear picture of what kind of relationship there is between n & me and I got 54 without moving lines (not the first time). To me it means that this is a relationship I have no influence over, it's driven by passion and its living its own life but that in the future I could be the Marrying Maiden. What is your opinion? Many thanks."
3849,"Hi you all! Hope you are doing great....I am back with another love related question and I appreciate your insight tremendously. I have had a crush on this person for almost two months but last time I asked I ching about the possibility of a relationship with this person(one month ago)I received hex 15 (humility) with no changing lines. So I waited, and waited, and waited and tried not to be too obvious, and then waited some more. Anyway, today I kind of became tired of waiting and I asked I Ching again "" give me some insight into the chances of a romantic relationship between X and I in the next six months"". I received Hex. 19 with changing lines 1 and 2. From what I understand, this is great, right?Please let me know how you interpret this answer.Thanks a lot!!"

I don't feel safe in my own home. And I don't know how to make enough money to live. I am planning to do some things on my own, but I am afraid I will fail. So, I asked Yi Jing: give me an insight into my life here and now, what should I do? I got 27.2.5. turning into 61 Well, 27 is quite obvious...it is about noursihment, providing for myself. 2 is saying that I am still dependent and that is true. Now my aunt sent me some money, because otherwise I don't know how to pay the bills.  5 is saying that I should seek advice with someone spiritually strong. What does that mean?  61 is saying probably that I should stay honest to myself and respect my inner truth. I do want to do things on my own, I have a plan but I don't know if it can work. But maybe 61 is saying to do things according to my inner call and  that's why life has brought all this on me so I can wake up and start making things happen. What do you think of this hexagrams? I need some insight into my life, all this has ben too much lately. Thank you."

I am not sure how to interpret it really.IN my other thread, i received a message of sacrifice. i think that this too? this has been an ongoing theme in my life recently, and continues to come up. specifically, sacrificing the ego so the Higher Self can guide.A good friend told me to weather these difficult times by transcending feelings of jealousy, anger and self preservation/defensiveness.

3860,"The question ""What do I do about this relationship?"" I got hex 42 with all changing lines.I'm a bit confused with line 6.

3864,"My two year heart and soul love/lust/longing for someone at work is drawing to a close. I am saddened by the fact that he is leaving for another job. So I asked Yi: Should I attend the party for him next Friday in order to say goodbye, and received:Hex 61(Inner Truth).2.3 > 37 (Family). From reading Karcher, line 2 says ""this is the profound call of one soul to another. Respond to it.It can change your life. I interpret this to mean that I should attend, but I know I will leave without getting my heart's desire - his amour attention, based on line 3 which says ""there is little I can do in this relationship,"" and that ""this situation may trap you."" Profound insight, as I have felt trapped with him for 2 years! The resulting 37 Family I interpret to be an understanding into this relationship and that not all will be lost attending.One more thing - I asked Yi in desperation two days ago, Is there hope of a future with David? and received Hex30.2>14 (Possesion in Great Measure). Here's an interesting twist - I believe the Yi answered the question the way I wanted to hear it and not how it really is - so I asked Yi "" Is the answer to my last question true? and received Hex 45 (Gathering Together.6>12 (Stagnation). This melodrama is nearing an end, and for those of you who were kind enough to offer your interpretation, I thank you. Feedback welcome!Laurie"
3865,"So, it's been a month now since we split apart. His divorce is reaching its final phase, as I have heard it's pretty nasty, but I have detached myself completely. Following the conversation we had, I suffered a lot of pain, sadness and loneliness but I have realised that he just can't deal with a new relationship (no matter how much he had tried) when his home situation is falling apart.However, he started calling me now. In a shy and restrained way but still so. I still have strong feelings for him, yet I am aware now that I was giving more than I was receiving and that the disbalance was very wrong.He invited me to his child's birthday and I'm not sure what to do. I like the kid and she would love to see me there as much as he would, but I know that I still have hopes we might eventually get back together.I asked ""What's in store for our relationship in the future?"" and got 23 > 9Am I to pay more attention to 9.4 than to hex 23 since there are 4 moving lines?Any suggestions are welcomed.Thank you a lot."

3870,"The question is: What should I think about confronting I. regarding events and feelings from our past (1-2 years past) that haven't been addressed.  This is a very sensitive issue in a marriage that is falling apart, and the period of time in question is when the troubles began.I got 64.4 -> 4From 64.4, I took this to mean that I should proceed with caution, and if I am firm in my resolve, and state my case with full honesty, the outcome will be good.  From 4, the message seems to be that I should not belabour questions that I have about this period of time, and if the answers I receive don't seem honest, that I should refrain from pushing for a different or more detailed answer.  Part of my motivation for wanting to open up this conversation is that I have never received satisfying answers to my questions about that time, so it's interesting that hex 4 came up- the bits about not bothering the oracle with the same questions again and again seems to be speaking to this motivation.  I guess that the Yi is telling me not to be so inmature...One thing that I found interesting about the changing 4th line is the bit about 3 years of rewards for great realms, not to mention the part Wilhelm-Baynes translate as the Devils Country.  My wife has become something of a devil in my eyes (and I in hers?).  We had our third anniversary in November, and it seems unlikely that we will be celebrating a fourth, yet this line seems to be talking about 3 years of (future) rewards.-tb"

Illinois is where my son lived up until he was 4, but last time he lived w/me was in AZ.  He has been drawn to poor choice making, struggles in school, and most recently a legal thing hanging out there that could really blow up if the police figure out all the pieces.  He has made some very small improvements since mid-January .. but recently again I can see (& sense) the defiance, self medicating, self defeating behaviors & choices.  Last night in frustration of what to do .. this is what the Yi guided me to ... What is at the root of Garret's behavior:59.6 >29What can I do to help?16.6 > 35Most likely outcome if Garret went to live w/his dad & stepmom again?2.1 > 24What will be the unfolding for him if he stays living here?6.1.3.5 > 14What is the next step I should take on behalf of ""G"" for his highest & best?2.4.6 > 35I just want to help him so much to help himself and set up the enviroment that will help him to not only discover his ""truth"" but to be the most successful.I am wondering if being here in IL is just making it so challenging for him.  59.6 > 29 - shows that this is really effecting him deeply.Thank you all in advance for any and all support you can give ...Namaste ...Beth"

But after that I am at a loss. I liked my question very much, and would love to understand the answer better if anyone has any thoughts."
3878,"I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to give me your thoughts to some readings that I did last night.I went for a job interview on Tuesday for a job as a Sales Administrator.  I had to do a practical work sheet first which went about 90% well, but I couldn't finish it all as my excel skills are a bit rusty.  I said at the outset I wouldn't be able to complete all the sheet, and explained that my excel skills needed some revision, and they said that was fine.  I would be trained on an in house system anyway.When we sat and talked after the practical sheet, the chap offered me a different job, explaining that what really struck him about me was how professional my voice sounded, and that he could really do with someone to answer calls that don't go through the automated telephone system.  He explained that he had trouble getting staff to take an effective message and pass it on.I immediately felt that my practical sheet had let me down, and that he felt I wasn't good enough for the admin job.  I asked if there would be the possibility to advance in the company if I took the second job, he said yes.  He then went back to talking about the adminastrative job, what it entailed etc.  We spent the next two hours talking about the admin job, my previous work, I asked lots of questions about his company and the software that they sell.  In all I spent almost 3 hours there.  I felt we got on really well, the conversation flowed, and I felt that we were both coming from the same direction.As I was leaving he asked me if I had anymore interviews, which I thought was an odd question.  I said no, not at the moment.  I explained that I had just started looking for jobs seriously, and I had to send a CV in quickly for this job.  As of yet I haven't applied for any others.  I was honest.The second job, I felt he had just thought up in his head while I was there, because when I asked more questions about what it would entail, he said he didn't know, he would have to look at it.  Which to me sounded like he was creating a job, but had not thought of enough to occupy my time in a full time position.  I really would like the adminastrative job, and think I really would get on well with it.  I have thought about the second job, and think I would take it, to get a foot in the door, and to be open to what the future might bring.  I really loved the company and felt a real affinity to the software that they sell.  I am a little shocked at myself to be honest that I want the admin job so much.  I can't really explain very well, but I feel a real connection to the company and software.  I used to use such a product for 13 years when I worked before.  I really understand how it works.Anyway, last night I asked what would happen if I got the Sales Administrators job.  I got hex 24.2.6  changing to 41.What would happen if I was offered the second job? Hex 42I asked what my options were with regard to the jobs? Hex 57.1.5 changing to 26I then did my usual Sunday night reading asking what I needed to know or advice about the coming week and got hex 10.3.4 changing to hex 9.I feel alarmed and worried about 24.2.6.  Hex 42 for the second job sounds OK.  My options I felt were OK too, apart from line 5 of 57; I was not sure what to make of that.My general asking for advice and what I need to know I felt started positively until I read 10.3!I feel I the yi is saying I might not be offered the Sales Administrators job, and that perhaps the second job might go better.

What really worries me is if I am offered the first job, the hex 24.2.6.Forgive me if I have read this all wrong, as I have not been doing readings for long.

3879,"What if I were more physically assertive with this man? 48.5 to 46And yet despite this reading, and evidence in real life to support it being well received, I hesitate. So I asked, Give me some insight into my hesitation? 41.2.5.6 to 3Oh, what is a girl to do ?"
3880,"Hello,:bows:I have difficulties interpreting the hexagrams I received and I would appreciate any help and insights you can offer. I have been working with this company for a while and I do like my job, it is very rewarding , but it is a very competitive job, since we work on commision and people are at each others throats sometimes, and I really bothers me. This is only a temporary job for me until I get more experience and build my makeup artist portfolio to get a job at an agency, doing makeup for magazines and commercials. That is my dream! There is an agency that I am interested working at, but I still have to build my portfolio, before I apply.I asked the I ching: Would it be good (favorable) for me to apply at agency x?  I got 58 1. 47I think this line encourages me to work towards that, I have it in me to achieve what I want. 47 could indicate that I can get discouraged easily and worry a lot. ??What can/should I do to get a position at agency x?I got 55 5.6. 13Well, line 5 and 6 are very much opposites.  While line 5 is positive, line 6 says misfortune. I am wondering if this line speaks about misfortune that is going to happen, it is fix, or is it only a warning. It changes into 13, which is working together with people in harmony.Is it the outcome or the background of the situation? I am not seeing a connection and I hope you can help.Thank you for reading,Manci "
3881,"I'm having some quite serious health problems at the moment, which are making things quite difficult for me in lots of areas.

3882,"Dear friends,I thought I would ask for your help, because my wife has become someone I don't even recognize. And I am so stunned that I really need outsiders' points of view and would appreciate it if you could do any divination you feel is appropriate for me. At this point I am not sure I even trust my own insights and instincts right now.The situation...I have had career frustrations for the past two and a half years. I am a school teacher and am pursuing a music career at the same time. Successes are happening, just slowly. ( by the way my wife is pursuing a career in opera). I still make enough money to cover almost all the bills, and because my wife works a little, (about 3 to 5 hours a week), that gives us what we need to more than just 'make it.'  However, she resents having to help with anything and would rather accumulate all 'her' money into savings. She remembers every dollar she has 'given' me and considers the condo where we live to be hers, while I pay all the bills and have no money left for savings. Lately she is threatening to leave me.  I am very disciplined in my work search, and in taking care of her and our baby with love and support.  I keep telling her that we are making it, and that things will get better because I am never going to give up. She in turn tells me my life is pathetic and that she doesn't know why she married me.  She is changing and turning into pure hatred. I've never seen anyone behave this way in my life.God bless all of you for any help and insight...sincerely,Schastlivchik"

3884,"I was recently rejected by a woman I fancy strongly and asked the I Ging how the future would look like and whether we would ever come together and I got 54.3. and 54.5 leading to 43. I am not certain whether 54.5 means that I should continue to hope but wait or rather let go, something I find very difficult. I feel that I messed the prospect of a deeper relationship up because I got far to demanding, following a promising kiss at the beginning - the social circumstances are rather delicate. I would like her to be my mistress and she is the friend of my wife and has a partner herself. I might want to add that we are all in our late fifties and early sixties (her partner is already 85). I love my wife dearly but our sexual relationship is not working anymore. The woman I desire to be my mistress has a partner who is 20 years older than her. I had worked out that we would be an ideal match to be together though it would have to be a secret relationship (of couse this is all highly inappropriate). It now looks that I have to give up my hopes though line 54.5 seems to suggest that their might still be a future.  Any suggestions?"

I am under so much stress right now. I am sure my questions below are not worded in the best manner for I-Ching and I apologize in advance.

3888,"The man I am developing a relationship with asked me to work on a project together with him. I would love to work with him, but I am not totally sure it's the right time/project for my career. If I don't take on this project, because of the circumstances, I will see much less of him. I initially said I was interested and we started doing some preliminary work. Then I sent him a note with a bunch of my questions concerning the project - he responded in a very uncharacteristic - ""this is ridiculous. you do your thing and I'll do mine""I asked Yi, ""what happened here? what is this about?""  Got 6.4 to 59Perhaps this speaks to my own uncertainty about the project but indicates that things will turn out well? I think it also advises me to not try to engage him on this topic and to let him figure things out for himself?What can I expect to happen between us this week? Got 53 unchanging. This seems to indicate things will gradually improve between us and we will move towards working together on this topic. (But I know that doesn't mean we will or will not work on the project together.)So then I asked what is the best approach for me to take with him now? Got 36 unchanging. This sounds like -- keep a low profile and things will work themselves out.Do you all agree or disagree with my interpretation? I would love your feedback."

3890,"I was inspired today to further my question from the other day (Abundance & Prosperity) taking everyone's imput into account and the feelings in my own heart.

Get more detail focused and do not seek the huge gains.   (I work a commission job, so perhaps focusing more the small details & follow through instead of going after the ""big one"").A couple things that I could use some assistance with is:I got the exact opposite last month and the question was:  Be & Know my Inner Truthand got 31.5>62So, I know this is a message to pay attention to.  Perhaps I didn't ""get it"" last month, so the Yi is giving it to me in a slightly different way???And:in today's hexagram:  line 5 speaks of clouds, no rain in the western region.  Maybe this speaks of the job I am in?  There is this ""promise"" of success, so far very little for me.  I've witnessed it for others who are doing quite well .. maybe it just isn't my match??

3893,"Hiya, after spending quite a lot of time lurking about here, I finally decided to join. ^_^;; A lil (boring) background info. Okay, at the moment, I'm a gap year student, having to work a few years out due to a long story. I'm panicking a little, life-wise. I've moved out of home and I have a job, but the trouble is they keep shaving my hours down, and I'm being paid min. wage as is the norm in my work. I'm just mega worried about money as I have the rent (£347 per month) to manage, plus food and bus fares, and I'm worried I'm gonna descend into overdraft and debt and all sorts and work won't cover it. I've been trying to search for more part-time work, but to not much avail, as you know what getting work can be like.And with my workplace undergoing a refurb come April, I'm worried they're gonna screw me over hours-wise. (I worry a lot, as you can see. XD)And financially, the only person who could possibly support me is my mother, but even she's struggling herself at the moment, so I pretty much am having to do the best I can for myself right now.  I've been worried about money a lot before, and was out of work for a month or so due to a sticky situation which I won't delve into here, but I still have trouble just...letting it go sometimes. So basically, I worry about being able to have enough money to live on most of the time. I just want to get back to being financially stable, and acheiving life goalsness, which is to take a couple of A Levels in science so I can go into a Science related course at University. Anyway, all I want is sorta....be able ""survive"" these few months, and be stable financially and life-wise (no more shakeups), and not have to worry about whether I'm gonna have enough money.I cast a hexagram asking about financial and general life stability, and I got back 48, changing lines 3, 4 and 6, changing to hexagram 6. (I've also been tarot-ing and the 6 of Wands pops up quite a bit at the moment.)I'm not sure what to make of this. I understand the 6 may mean the context, i.e. the conflict around myself and that I'm worrying, but I'm not sure what The Well is meant to mean. Does it mean I should sit tight, spend as little as possible and that everything will be ok? Also, the changing lines seem to say that, yeah, although I can't get the water right now (changing line 3) that the well is being rebuilt and I'll soon be able to get the water that I need, i.e. financial stability and life stability. (lines 4 and 6). Is that right?I'm also a lil worried about this 6 hexagram, conflict. I don't need any more of it in my life right now, I've had enough of it.  Is it just the surrounding context of my situation?Anyone able to offer their thoughts on this?"
3894,can someone help me find the related hexagram?I accidently clicked the flash player away and my book is at home so I can't look it up in the index is there an online calculator to automatically give the related hexagram if I input the primary one?Ta everyone!
3895,"I have a male acquaintance who is interested in me. I am interested in him as a friend but not sure that anything more would be possible.  Due to my doubt, I have qualms about going out with him because I do not want to put him or myself through any pain, but I also do not want to jump the gun w/o giving things a chance. In the past I have had similar situations to this and neither worked out well. I want to avoid anything awkward and painful but do not know the best course of action.  I asked the Yi, ""What will happen if I go out with X?""The Yi gave me Hexagram 9 with every line changing except for the 4th; and then Hexagram 2. I understand the Taming Power of the Weak to mean move forward slowly and with moderation. The many changing lines seem to be the YI asking me to pay attention (exclamation point!) but i dont know what the overall message is. Those lines are as follows:KEY: (Line #: Wilhelm translation. /other interpretations).Line 1: Return to the way. How could there be blame in this? Good fortune./The Superior Man follows the path on which he can advance or retreat as he wishes. It is wise and sensible to avoid obtaining anything by force, and so good fortune must result. Line 2: He allows himself to be drawn into returning. Good fortune./ the best course is to retreat (from dating him??) and that will bring good fortune; do not endanger yrself unnecessarily.Line 3: The spokes burst out of the wagon wheel.Man and wife roll their eyes./ In trying to force a way ahead in spite of the obstacles in the way, the man suffered a serious accident. He has ignored the advice of the weaker party. Conditions beyond his control have proved him wrong. But the result is to no-one’s advantage, and, quarreling with his companion, he sacrifices his dignity.Line 5: If you are sincere and loyally attached, You are rich in your neighbor./In the weaker person loyalty means devotion. In the stronger person it breeds trust. Both result in stronger ties. Each member of the partnership complements the other. The outcome is success for both. Does this mean be sincere and loyal (and go out with him??)Line 6: The rain comes, there is rest. This is due to the lasting affect of character.Perseverance brings the woman into danger. The moon is nearly full. If the superior man persists, Misfortune comes. /The wind, continually driving the clouds together, finally brings rain. But this success has been achieved by cautious advance, not precipitate action. It is not wise to pursue such actions further. The moon represents the darker powers. When it reaches fullness it is already on the wane. One must be content with what has already been attained.  ie. do not try to turn this into more. (fine, I am not, but what about dating him vs not?)Hex 2: The Judgement-- The Receptive brings about sublime success, Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, He goes astray; But if he follows, he finds guidance. It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,To forego friends in the east and north.  Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.The Image -- The earth's condition is receptive devotion. Thus the superior man who has breadth of character Carries the outer world."

3898,"Hi, I am a total beginner and I could really use some help. My ex-boyfriend broke up with me some months ago,  we both knew that the relationship wasn't working. But when he did so he said that he still loved me, but that for our relationship to work he needed a break and for us to start out afresh. Basically he left his foot in the door when he ended things. This has left me unable to move on, I'm clinging on to hope that we can work things out,  so today I asked the question ""What do I need to know about him?"", in return I got Hexagram 2.1.3 changing to Hexagram 36.Could someone please shed some light on this?"
3899,"Okay, a lil sorta background info is in the last topic I made:http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/friends/showthread.php?t=5344So yeah. Job where I'm not making quite enough money and they're cutting down my hours and worrying about money still. Also, if this is relevant, I'm in my sorta gap year (long story) and I'm hoping to study something biomedicalness/medicalness at Uni, altho still not sure which course to take or what or where.Anyway, first hexagram. - The Deja Vu hexagramSo I sorta get those weird precognitive deja vu type things, where you get the deja vus that seem to go into a pattern, and they usually pop up when something is going to happen, and that I should take note of it, or know there is gonna be a change. Usually they have a sorta....""flavour""....like, a good or bad flavour, but at the moment, I don't have a clue what this next one is. I'm not even sure what ""flavour"" it is, but something is coming up. So I asked ""what is the deja vu telling me?"", and I got Hexagram 7.1 transforming to 19. Any ideas? - The How To Get A Better Job Hexagram Since In My Last Topic Someone Suggested I Should Ask The Yi This Or Something Like That.So yeah. Job that doesn't pay me enough. Do I look for another full time one? Do I look for a part time one to plug the gaps in this one? (In fact, I've just been offered an interview for some supermarket up the road today) Anyways, I asked the Yi ""How do I go about getting a better job?"" It gave me 32.6 ---> 50. So....any ideas bout this one? - The ""I Don't Know Why I'm Asking It This But I'm Asking It What Job I Should Get"" HexagramOn a whim, I asked what job I should look for, Hexagram 2, changing lines 1,3,4 and 6, changing to 30. Do I bug pharmacies and such for jobs? (If I had a sales assistant-esque not-qualified-just-here-for-some-work-experience in a pharmacy that'd be awesome, but it's kinda hard to get it) Do I just stay with something that pays the bills?What does 2:1.3.4.6-->30 mean as far as jobs go?- The ""How Do I Achieve My Goals"" hexagram. So basically, what I wanna achieve is to be financially stable, get a stable job that pays the bills and gives me a decent surplus of cash, nothing massive but not tiny either. I wanna pay my mother back (she lent me money for the rent), get those A Levels so I can do the sciencey uni degree. I wanna get myself a computer, get a haircut, get glasses (I'm slightly short sighted and would need glasses to drive for instance), generally change myself when I have the money and resources as I'm not happy with who I am and where I am right now, but don't have the money to change myself right now. (hence the job worry) I want to achieve my goals this year, but am not sure how exactly. I got 50.1--->14. Any ideas?So yeah, there we are, thanks for any ideas. :3Last edited: Mar 10, 2008"
3900,"Hello all, this is my first post here, but i've been reading you...let's say the last three years. I have a relationship with the yi since my teenyears...and now we're reaching an understanding with each other. Last week I asked ''What do I have to do, now?'' (que tengo que hacer yo, ahora?) and the yi responded to me 32.2.5, 31.I chew the answer, think... try to make it my own. Maybe the question looks like ""now, now,now'' but that isn't the sense...and I came across Karcher and ''fixing the omen'' ...that make more sense, that is something that i can relate to my mind when i've had asked. I look on the internet, and everything I can find, but still doesn't relate to me completely, so five days later (on thursday night) I asked again ""yi, I don't undestand 32 to 31, could you open my knowledge'' (Yi, no entendí bien 32.31, podrías abrirme el conocimiento---tirame un centro!!) and the yi responded: 37.4.5.6, 55. I feel this more precisely, and feel the relationship between de two answers. This second appears to me as something practical...I ask everyone here on the forum for:- recomendations of articles to read....and/or your insights of the possible relationships between this answers, the hexagrams...I see it as32-duration (female-perseverance) 31-mutual attraction (grab the woman...stick to 32)...in my language...seguí por acá que vas bien...(go on this way, you're in the way)37 (and the lines I have) people of the house, female...to abbundance. (a note: in the past month i received a lot of 38...38 all over with acclarations in 50...well cross my mind that i'm travelling backwards (to living the sequence-moments...this rings a bell to somebody??) 32 to 31, look powerful..and 37 to 55 more down to earth, but with a message)- what is Karcher saying (I like to read your views) with ''fixing the omen''? (i like his shamanic approach..I don't have Total I ching, i have the lover's one in spanish...the translation is very, very bad)well, I hope you, forum navigators, can understand me...my english is very limited (I will take care of that..is my task of the year )besos y gracias."
3901,"A little background to the question - I am living in IL, coming back here to live after living in AZ for 11yrs. (been back for 1 1/2 yrs). Things from job to relationships, etc just hasn't seem to ""click"" for me being back here (I will feel down a lot - questioning my job, purpose, etc) .  There is a part of me that is missing AZ very much - friends are there, my daughter is there ... but also aware of the part of me that defaults into ""escaping"" sometimes - ie, grass is greener.  The answer from my question 4.2.5. > 20  (What would be the inner truth of seeling my home (now or soon) and moving back to AZ?) seems to be positive, but I get the sense that there is something more to learn or ""get"".

3902,I've been very dissastisfied and frustrated with my current relationship for a very long time already.  So today I ask IChing (using the online computer generated one here) and ask 'What can I expect if I'm to break off my relationship with this man' and got 63.6 which changes to 37.It seems to advice me that it's not good of me breaking off the relationship but yet everyday I hated him more and more and it's making me very dissatisfied and frustrated.Can anyone share some light on my reading? Is Iching really telling me not to break off or is there hidden meaning behind this? By the way can we really trust computer generated reading?
3903,"I am struggling somewhat with my studies, and am not sure where my current road will lead. I asked the iching, 'Can i succeed in my endeavours?'54.1.3.6 to 50It seems like it is a romantic reading instead, or perhaps the iching is consoling me.I sure hope that 50 means that the end would be favorable.But it seems 54.6 does not seem very good; what do they mean?Any help would be appreciated.I also asked, with regards to the guy I am seeing, where does he want to go with me?I got hexagram 43 - breakthrough. What does it symbolise?"
3904,"I am new to this forum and relatively new to i ching. I am separated from my partner, we have a son. I have been working slowly and persistently to reconcile. I have gotten a SLOW, but increasingly better response from my partner. I have consulted the i ching throughout the process and have been grateful for the experience. My path back to my partner has been spiritual and solitary. He says he sees a possibility of reconciliation after some time and some of his own personal growth.I have gotten hexagram 32 three times. I used an online cast, and also i have sat and cast coins for the first time. on each occasion, i have envisioned myself marrying him rather than asking anything specific, and i get 32.  I would love some insight into hexagram 32. i feel like it's pretty straight forward, that relationships that become marriages take slow steady progress and time. can this be just my process, or could it be ""our"" process?"

3911,"I've done this before, asking the Yi about computer programming. Not that I ever got anwers that I could make much sense of, and perhaps the Yi is not really interested in such questions. But it's fun and who knows .. This time I asked how to make a program that I'm working on faster. The program is board game program that currently only plays traditional chess, but with a few adaptations it can also play other chess variants or games like chess (technically 'zero-sum games with complete information'). Such programs search large trees of positions to find the best move and that costs a lot of time. Even when the program evaluates more than a million positions/sec (mine gets on average close to 2 million/sec on this computer).  There are known tricks to speed up the search, but I'm looking for new (and hopefully better) ideas. So I asked the Yi: How to speed up the search (in a new way)? 40.2.4>2 ..

That I should avoid ""undertakings"" - at least until my anger clears.Wilhelm/Baynes said:The ImageThunder over the lake:The image of the Marrying Maiden.Thus the superior manUnderstands the transitoryIn the light of the eternity of the end.Click to expand...This seems to be reassuring me that my anger will clear/that because everything is transitory, dark times will pass and make way for ""the light of the eternity of the end"".Wilhelm/Baynes said:Six at the top means:The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.Nothing that acts to further.Click to expand...Again- Counciling against action?  I'm not sure I understand these words.  The commentary talks about how the basket and sheep are parts of a marriage rite, so this is possibly talking about the marriage/relationship being a farce, or based on a ceremony that was empty of meaning?38. K'uei / OppositionWilhelm/Baynes said:The JudgementOpposition. In small matters, good fortune.The ImageAbove, fire; below, the lake:The image of Opposition.Thus amid all fellowshipThe superior man retains his individualityClick to expand....As the resulting hex, this seems to be hinting at a future split?  So I should avoid acting out on my anger for the moment so that I can enjoy the ""good fortune"" of a future split with my wife (retaining my individuality)?  I'm having a hard time with this hex here.  I guess that my issue is that the matters that are the stem of my anger are pretty far from being ""small matters"".  Or is this saying that I'll be SOL in the big matters, but have good fortune with small matters (gee, thanks!).Sometimes, when I do a reading, I have a hard time determinging who I should relate to in the text.  For example, in 54, it talks of a young woman.  The commentary talks about how this young woman would be part of a household with her husband and, likely, a mistress.  Who am I here?  Am I the young woman, the mistress or the husband?  I suppose that it hardly matters, because the text seems to be counciling me not to make waves (I guess this makes me the maiden, eh?).Nuclear Hex (from 54): 63. Chi Chi / After CompletionWilhelm/Baynes said:The JudgementAfter Completion. Success in small matters.Perseverance furthers.At the beginning good fortune,At the end disorder.The ImageWater over fire: the image of the conditionIn After Completion.Thus the superior manTakes thought of misfortuneAnd arms himself against it in advance.Click to expand...I never really know how to ,look at the nuclear hex.  In Ritsema/Karcher, they say that it is traditionally looked at as what I should not do.  So I guess I should cast away thoughts of misfortune, and leave myself vulnerable?"

3916,"Does the Yi ever answer questions other than those you ask? Methinks it does .I've been on a rather emotional rollercoaster the past few days and today I asked the Yi how I can best realize my talents (as to me, that is the answer to many of my questions at present). The Yi gave me Hex 37 The Clan, changing lines 3 and 4 and then Hex 25 the Unexpected.I *get* hex 25 -- in fact, that could have been the entire answer to my question as I interpreted it: If you are clear-minded, act with sincerity/integrity and are not acting on ulterior or cheap motives, you will be successful. OK, solid advice.But then what the heck is 37 and those lines doing in there? The clan? Is the Yi pointing to a family problem that needs to be addressed? Or does this have another meaning? The lines, for reference, are:line 3: When tempers flare up in the family, Too great severity brings remorse.Good fortune nonetheless. When woman and child dally and laugh, It leads in the end to humiliation.I read an interpretation of this line that implies complying with what the family wants. In other words, submitting your career/dreams to their will. Is that true?Line 4: She is the treasure of the house. Great good fortune.(I can't for the life of  me see how this line applies).Any help is much appreciated.-e."

3919,"Hi everyone,I asked the I Ching this morning if I should pursue a particular idea I have for a creative project and got this reading back.  It is a very important decision to me so I want to be sure I am reading this right.I was glad to see Hilary's latest post was on 7 so this helps me along.  I am reading it as saying yes, I can go forward, but must do so by rolling up my sleeves and being very orderly and disciplined.  The 6 in 4 I read as saying that it is not the time to engage directly in my project but to gather my resources for action at a later time.The 40 makes my heart go pitter patter.  I have been relentelssly searching for more than a month for a good path for myself (I am definitely at a time of critical change in my life) and this 40 seems to promise that I can stop the searching and settle down into a regular pursuit of my objective.What do you think?  I'd love to hear from you.Kind regards,Kim"

3921,"Hi folks! This is a my first post on this forum and I'm quite the Yi newbie. Have a question about a reading that has come up twice--in two different questions regarding the same person. Can't remember my first question, but the second was ""How will I know when it's right to send X an apology?"" As this is my first timing question, I don't know how to proceed. Any thoughts?14: (changing line 6) to 34.Thank you!"
3922,"Hi,I am so happy to have discovered this forum as I begin my new adventure.  I've been listening intently to my intuitive voice through meditation for the past month (why, oh why, didn't I sart years ago) and have been led here.  My first contact with the I Ching feels like falling in love.  I am so excited.  So far I've only asked two questions of the oracle (is that what you call it - personally I am thinking of it is a direct line to my higher self).  Yesterday's answer rang through on so many levels that I am still digesting.  I thought today to try a yes or no question.  My question was: Is this house bad for our financial situation?  The response was 10,4 going to 61 (hope you understand my notation of that - gotta learn the way you do it here).  Here's my interpretation:  Yes, it is bad for our finances, but there is much hope of fixing this if I remedy the situation.  The reason why I was wondering about the house is because of recently finding out that our house is Double Sitting (which means bad for money) according to feng shui principles; a situation that is confirmed by my experience (since moving here 6 months ago we've been in free fall).  I have been hesitating to apply feng shui cures to this situation because I'm not so sure I believe in all that anyway.  What do you think, is the I Ching giving me the green light on feng shui cures to help my financial situaiton?Thanks for having me among you and kind regards to all!Kim"

For this particular situation, it strikes me that the status quo is standstill and it would be very nice to think that there would be some positive progress in the near future!

3932,"Howdy - I'm new here.  I have been using the I Ching off and on for years, but don't really know the ins and outs of real interpretation. I generally use it to give me a feeling for a situation and stick to the initial hexagram because I don't know how to really interpret the moving lines and the resultant second hexagram.Question I asked: Is getting a divorce (now) the good decision for my husband and me?A little history...this question has been around for awhile and I ask it every few months, getting a different reply each time (although 23 comes up a lot).  We have a difficult time communicating (actually talking) about important stuff and I feel like my life is stagnating (he does too I'm sure). So we go to therapy with little luck and I ask the I Ching periodically for direction.  The answer was 59 with a moving line in 6 to make 29. (I don't know how to represent moving lines 59.6?)59. Huan / Dispersion (Dissolution)29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)It seems that 59 implies that it is perhaps a good idea to broach the subject now - divorce/dispersion - but I'm a little confused about the moving line and hexagram 29.  I don't really know how to interpret the moving line and new hexagrams well.  I don't really know what they stand for.Any insight would be helpful.Thanks!"

I am not about to interfere in a pre-established relationship and am friends with the girlfriend. I asked the YI what this guy wants from me. It said 21.4 and 27.line 4: Bites on dried gristly meat. Receives metal arrows. It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties And to be persevering. Good fortune.What does this mean? He is going through a tough time and needs support?

3938,"Hi all,I am very new to this wonderful site. I've used the I Ching for several years now, perhaps once a year when chaos/crossroads have arisen.My question is about trigrams. For instance, I just cast the coins and got Hexagram 39 (relating Hexagram is 49) and, in looking up all of the aspects of it, found that Hexagram 49 feels where I am mostly and am headed, and as for 39, the primary Hexagram, it is the trigrams--as described here by Hilary--that fit my situation more than the Hexagram itself does. These two trigrams as elements/forces feel like the active means, whereas the hexagram they form in number 39 feels stagnant, and I am not in a stagnant place right now). So in this instance  far more than the Hexagram itself does. Would any experienced voices here be able to offer the correct protocal regarding trigrams? Many thanks and looking forward to more discussion here,Gillian"

3942,"Hello I Ching Community,My first wife and I were married very young.  We had a very stormy marriage that ended after five years.  Approximately 17 years have passed and I discovered in an article in our city's newspaper that she and her husband now have two daughters - one is four years old - the same age as my son.  My current wife and I have often spoken about her and she has told me that I should get in touch with her.  I would really like to in some ways.  Not because I want to ""go back in the past"" but because I think it might be a healthy and healing thing for both of us.  But I'm not sure.  I consulted the I Ching with the question:What would the impact be on both hers and my own family if I were to contact her.  I received Hexagram 32 with no changing lines.  I am slightly shocked that this hexagram focuses so much on the institution of marriage as the enduring union of the sexes.  I read the hexagram carefully and think it is supporting my getting in touch with her.  I would like to know what members of this community think.  I have been a student of the I Ching since the early 80s and would appreciate hearing from all who feel they have benefitted from the guidance of this work.Thanks,Dorje Chodzin:bows:"
3943,"Hello,I recently became a supervisor in a work situation that involved my coming in brand new to an educational community.

That said, when I took over this job there was a person who very much thought she should have been given the position I inherited.  I came in to this community brand new and she was a founding member.  I could say more...the problem is that sometimes she is difficult to work with...she is very emotional and sometimes is just mentally and professionally unreliable.  I can live with this because she works well with her students and can be quite ""brilliant"" at times.  That said, I sometimes have to turn to the I Ching to give me insights into dealing with her.I recently asked what my attitude towards her should be and I received Hexagram 22 with a changing line in the first place - transforming to Hexagram 52.

3957,Well to be honest .Something is going really wrong with a guy...Well we are not talking right now...So I asked I ching IF he will ever talk to me again and I got hexagram51...Anyone knows what that means?
3958,"I asked, what can i expect if i see him tomorrow? I have a choice, either to take up the afternoon shift or stay home to see him, since it is valentine's day. So I was wondering if I should immerse myself in work or see him.I chose the latter, and asked the i ching the question.It's weird that joy goes to conflict. What does it mean, specifically?Thank you for interpreting I asked, what is our relationship based upon?I got 2,2,6 ->4What does it refer to?2.6 sounds bad, like a squabbleLast edited: Feb 13, 2008"
3959,"Hi,There is a situation in my work environment. Today I had a conversation with one of my partners . Didn’t go well, in my opinion, so I asked “ help me” and got  1.4. to 9The situation has to do with a personal matter that affect my productivity, and although for me is serious enough, I didn’t get the impression that I was understood well. The personal –thing is closely relate with the work-thing so I’m not sure about Yi answer.  My brief interpretation is don’t worry and do what do you thing is right  but I would like to hear what you see in 1.4 and 9.4 . About 9 my questions is “what/who  to tame?”Any ideas would be helpful,Thanks Mariasorry wrong title 1.4 to 9 , thought 1.5 sounds better "
3960,"There is a man I am frustrated with. I feel in a state of limbo with him.My question was:What should I do about my relationship with Z?Hex 19Hex 19 is one of my favourite hexagrams.Approach - Arrival of the new; approach of something powerful and meaningful; welcome draw nearer and closerThere is something coming that will change the relationship. Welcome this and don't rush to completion.Line 2Conjunction nearing, The Way is open. There is nothing for which this is not be advantageous.This is the return of something important. Be open. Provide what is needed.Line 5Knowledge meaning, The Great Leader sacrifices at the Great Altar. The Way is OpenArticulate things. Find your voice. Take things in.Hex 3Difficulty at the BeginningBegin, establish, found, gather your strength, surmount difficulties.The old time is ending, while a new time is sprouting a new. Take this time to strip away old ideas and experiences.I don't know if this means that something is coming I don't know about yet and to just be a little more patient or whether I should say something about my frustrations and then change will come."
3961,"I seldom cast a 1.I had an interview this morning and this is the 3rd one with this same company.

3962,"Now, I'm VERY upset - that is, very angry and much worried... Anyhow: remember the last episode of ""Amalia's life as a writer?"". After receiving my counterproposal, My agent wrote me a rather resentful and vehement e-mail, telling me he was ""offended"" by what I wrote (that is, he was offended by the fact I could have thought to a counterproposal. I can swear that I have been very correct on a formal basis), but he was not very clear whether he still wanted to discuss the proposal or not - he made several but not global remarks about it. I answered that business and personal feelings have nothing to do with each other; that, as I have not thought myself legitimated to show my irritation to him, he's not legitimated to show his to me as well. I told him my aim is to reach an agreement satysfing for both of us, and I asked him if he is still interested in the whole thing, or If he wants to call it off (he wrote he was very surprised that I thought a contract can be object of negotiation - !!!). Then, I took into consideration his remarks about the proposal, accepting some of them and refusing others. I sent the mail in the late morning, and I am still waiting for an answer. I asked the I-Ching: ""What is going to happen now?"" The answer was hex. 25, no changing lines. The Oracle seems to keep encouraging me (I know HIS former proposal was pretty unfair - but this is normal - in business, you're supposed to ask for the moon in order to get some piece of land...), but I do not have much hope - he doesn't seem to understand..."

3964,"Hi!  I haven't been doing that many readings lately but I've been having trouble with someone and I need to know what her opinion of me is:What's her opinion of me?The answer was 42.5If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.Supreme good fortune.Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue. I'm terribly puzzled by this answer as the person in question has been making my life very difficult.  Could this answer indicate that she realizes I'm innocent and that she's unfairly accusing me?  This would make her behavior all the more sinister.I also asked why she is doing this to me:25.6 to 17Innocent action brings misfortune.Nothing furthers.She wants to stop me from doing something?  She wants me to back off of something that I've been doing, to stay uninvolved?"

I asked Yi “what should I know about that relationship ? ” and got 54.1,2,4 to 2 I see 54 as compromise with the situation and be receptive/patient . She is expecting a baby in a couple of weeks and maybe is that’s why she was behaving like that .There are some worries about the health of her baby, so maybe this was the “problem” I wonder if you see something more in that readingThanks,Maria"

3969,"I asked for some advice about a highly emotional subject. I am an art student in a conservative art school and I am not making my thoughts, ideas, and expressions clear enough to an older generation of artists who have lived in their ivory towers of academia and don't get how I am trying to relate information about the ""real world"". I am frustrated and creating long and detailed monologues in my head of how I want to convey my opinions and get through to them. I asked the I Ching ""Please help me with advice on this monologue in my head to all Bachelor of Fine Art professors?"" and got 63 line 5. I am thinking this means I can get what I need to get out through other channels other then art school. That I can have faith that if I am sincere some other way other then traditional art school will work. What do you think of this reading? Please help!"

3971,"My sexuality has been hidden even from me recently ... and I think when I walked away from that creative project a few weeks ago I missed an opening. It's partly perimenapause, I think. So after realizing all this, I asked Yi ""How to Open my Sexual Energy Channel?"" and received 1 unchanging. Wow - creativity. But can any of you help point to exactly WHAT this means I should do? I need an energy release or shift I think, or a vibrational shift."
3972,"I asked the I-Ching about the effects ayurvedic medicine would have on my body and got 32.3.5.6 changing to 6. In Karcher’s ‘How to use the I Ching’ it’s quoted:32.3 You do not persevere in virtue. Even if you receive gifts you will be embarrassed by them, because you are being false to yourself. You feel the shame and confusion of having lost the way. Deliver yourself from this attitude.In one thread, jesed wrote: ‘March and April, 2008: A time to test the reality and root of your desire. Is it consistent, well-rooted; or does it remain at the mercy of moods of hope or fear? (line 3)’ Does this mean that if I decide to use ayurveda my decision should be serious and not taken on a whim? 32.5 Persevere in your virtue. This is a time of transition. You must choose how to act. If you choose the woman’s way, the way is open for you. Adhere to what you’re doing. If you choose the way of the father and his son, the way is closed. Cut yourself off from this situation and leave.What does the woman’s way mean here?For hex 6 he writes ‘Arguing’…I find that these interpretations appear different from the ones I found in Wilhelm and other sites. I'm new at this and it's pretty confusing. Which one would I choose? I have the feeling if I go with other interpretations the result sounds positive. If I use Karcher's it sounds negative. (Or am I too green to make sense of this?) What are your takes on this?"
3973,"Hello- I had a friendship with romantic overtones which went on for about a year. Even though in our interactions, I let him know that friendship would most likely be best, in private, I idealized him. He is beautiful, intelligent, and strong, but also somewhat given to dishonesty, addiction and womanizing. Recently we saw one another- that same chemistry was there-- I want to be with someone who brings out the best in me- and I felt alot of that there. We kissed but the interaction mostly was satisfying in terms of frienship on my part-- i just love talking to him, and sense that I should be wary of the traps he has fallen into.Recently after not hearing back from him, I let him know that I understood if he was out of touch given his situation (recovering from an addiction, unhealthy relationships with women,) and perhaps our interaction, and that I hoped he was well--It hurts thoughm I am trying hard to not take things personally- I didnt handle things perfectly, but I would like to grow - I asked how can I move forward from this and be better? I received 15-8 -- 8 has come up alot in my questions regarding this frienship-Can anyone let me know what they see here? 8 in particular confuses me. Thanks for reading this kind of long post,  and any advice."

All your sorrows will fade. The situation is already changing.63 Fording the river. The action is already underway.The situations I have found myself in are unhappy ones.

3975,"Hello Fellow Seekers,I have good news about a funny fantasy novel I wrote about 16 years ago. CIRCE is my favourite piece of work, my first novel.  And it has found a publisher with Mojocastle Press. A very fair contract  with 45% royalty on net proceeds. The book will initially be in digital format and then as a paperback. I am thrilled. There is a bit of editing I expect to do along with the editor - which will be a terrific experience I'm sure - working with a professional editor. She said we had to take out one of the chapters - Pasiphae's Perversion - and I said fine and offered to replace it with a fresh chapter. I drew hex 18 when I asked about the future of my book with this publisher and it immediately made sense to me. The hex spoke of working hard and changing something spoilt. I was all goosebumpy when I read that its ideogram is a jar of poisonous insects which reminded me of the ejaculate of King Minos - full of of scorpions, etc!!! Minos, the husband of Pasiphae. So I got to work and wrote to my publisher about my idea about revisiting the Maya (There's another chapter dealing with the Maya in the book) - this time to do with chocolate as a substitute for sex. The book is really a satire on sex and the love quest. She said good and I wrote the new chapter. I was a bit nervous - after all, my tone and style had to be the same as 16 years ago! I bleieve I did a good job - I got good critiques from my writing workshop.  So what's the point of this post? Just to share with my fellow seekers what I understand about 18 - get moving! Any other takes on this?  Best for your QuestAnita"
3976,"I haven't been truly motivated on a job since this one job I had back in 2004. It does bother me.I asked the YiWhy is my work motivation lacking and not like it was when I worked at X?17.1.5. >1617 FollowingProviding for people's needs will necessarily create following. Thus there comes the time for following. Accept this.Line 1 : Leave your old life behind. Walk out of your old thought and mix with new people.

Gather energy for a decisive new move.16 EnthusiasmEnthusiasm is certainly what I am lacking about these jobs I have had.Gathering what I need to need to meet and enjoy what the future brings.It seems that possibly even though some aspects of the jobs I have had were great, like the friendships that formed, the actual work I am doing doesn't fit.Maybe what I am doing just isn't right for me?

I am probably making it more important than what it really is.Line 3 ‘Not crossing over, he defends himself.Someone is following behind and may kill him.Pitfall.’It seems I'm in an impossible situation here.Line 4‘No mistake.Not crossing over, meeting it.Going on is dangerous, must be on guard.Don’t use ever-flowing constancy.’Take a look at the dangers the relationship has just passed through.2 ReceptiveI'm not sure how to read 2 here.

So I thought I'd ask if there are any thoughts out there?  I am consistently struck with the readers' thoughtful replies here on this forum, and would like your take if you'd like to offer it.I did love the ""Returning"" since this is about the election returns--isn't the I Ching funny that way?  And don't know what ""Biting Through"" might refer to--that seems more like a kind of Tyson/Holifield (sp?) kind of answerNancy"
3980,"Greetings my friends,I asked the question ""how can I find my teacher"" -by which I meant teacher of dharma (vajrayana). I used the online generation of hexameters and received P'i twice.

3981,"Another fun game to share, and perhaps this will inspire others to try this out.Recently, my wife and I played Monopoly with another couple. I decided to predict the game results from the start using the first roll of the dice.  In the end, it actually worked, with the final scores appearing in the order as predicted from the beginning.  The process was as follows:Each player threw the dice to see who would go first. Here are the throws:Player A: 8 (which equals Kun, earth)Player B: 6 (which equals Kan, water)Player C: 8 (which equals Kun, earth)Player D: 10 (which reduces to 2 for Dui, lake)Given that it was late evening, it meant that Water energy is the strongest, and that therefore player B would be most supported and win, followed by player D, metal.  Players A and C, both with Earth would come in last.  After almost three hours, player D decided to end the game, so we counted it all up, and the results were:1st - player B with $4,8782nd - player D with $4,3923rd - player C with $3,4004th - player A with $2,827While this is fun and all, it also suggests a lot about timing and hidden influences, such as the first step in an endeavor, and its subsequent influence on how something will develop as a result.  After all, not all endeavors turn out the same for everyone.I truly hope you all have enjoyed reading this, and that your insights will be even more beneficial and helpful to all.Schastlivchik"
3982,"Hello Fellow Seekers,About a couple of years ago, I spent a week with a nice guy in Amsterdam.  I did not fall for him, but it seems he may have.  We barely keep in touch and now he has invited me all expenses paid to Greece and Amsterdam.  A dream - Greece - and I was very excited and said yes, till I realised through my spiritual masters that this would create a big karmic debt.  Which I can only repay by introducing him to the priceless Ceremony that The Buddha himself underwent before his nirvana.  However, he has not been very positive about this, although I have told him this is no religion and does not demand his practice.  I wrote to him last night suggesting he come get that first because it is the only way I can repay him for his generosity.  I drew hex. 18 when I asked if I'd meet him again and 18 -line 3 moving to hex. 4 for whether he'd come for the Ceremony.  I find this hex most difficult to decipher.

Anyway I really don't know what will happen to me with this particular job.  As I'm a temp lol however I was tempted to ask the I-Ching the following question?  My state of mind when asking this was nuetral as I don't really know the answers but this is what the I-ching replied back with?A.) The Diagnosis of my concrete situation in my actual job?i.) Recieved 19 lin approach.The changes of lines at 3 and 5.a.) Comfortable approach. Nothing that would further. If one is induced to grieve over it,One becomes free of blame. ii.) I believe this line says a lot that I should not grieve over this job and continue to work at it but keep a positive face and be happy during hardship's and what will happen in the immediate future. b.) Wise approach.This is right for a great prince.Good fortune.ii.)  I don't understand this particular line but this translates to me, leaving this company was a very wise thing to do before they would tell me to go. My contract expires in March so whatever happen's will happen. k.) However here is the shock, lines I recieved next was 51 Chên / The Arousing (Shock, Thunder)  The image pasted below makes me think that the company I am working for do really get rid of me. Due to this I then start to examine my goals and my future to finally see what my purpose is?  ii.) Thunder repeated: the image of Shock. Thus in fear and trembling the superior man sets his life in order And examines himself.Have I got my interpretation correct?  Would it be wise to ask the I-ching, whether my future at this company is short-lived in other words will i get sacked? or is that too yes and noWarm Regards,  indra"
3985,"I asked if I should expect anything more than friendship from X. 15.3 to hexagram 2.°Nine in the third place means:A superior man of modesty and meritCarries things to conclusion.Good fortune.The ""romance"" has been dragging for some time, and maybe 15.3 illuminates that things could be carried to a conclusion.

3987,"I asked a question regarding my application for entry into school, and the iching said it would be successful. However, I got a letter that says it's unsuccessful. What gives?I feel like i've lost faith a little in oracles..please tell me im wrong."
3988,"I go right to the point. The contract with my agent has expired two days ago - he did not notice it (seems to be quite naive and absent-minded about legal details...). I have called him to ask if he agreed to sign a new contract, and he has answered yes. But he's just sent me a copy of the new contract, and unfortunately there are many paragraphs I cannot accept, plus an increase in his percentages (from 12% to 15% in our country, and from 15% to 20% abroad...). I see I must discuss about it (and I hate to do such things - it can be hard to believe, but I'm quite shy). I have thought about the possibility of leaving him and finding  another agent, but I'm still waiting for an answer from an important publishing house he put me in contact with (strange as it is, my novel is to be read by the owner of the house herself - so I have what I call a ""real chance"", for if she likes me, she can decide to publish me with no further delay), and so it seems not too convenient in this moment to leave him. Now I asked the Oracle: What would happen if I write down all my observations about the contract and send them to him by e-mail (this after talking to my lawyer)? The answer was hex. 11, changing lines n. 1, 2, 3, 4 (SOO MANY! It seems to be such a transient situation...) - to hex. 16. Now this seems a favourable reply, but I wonder if I have to ask something more - I am quite confused by now. Any suggestion?"
3989,"As I wrote in another thread, I am leaving the country I am in and I am leaving for a few very valid reasons.One of them is that I know it is best to put distance between myself and the man that has been in my veins and in my blood. All of the regulars have seen me go through the ups and downs and back and forths..it's been so damn hard.The most recent slight from him hurt me, especially after the effort I made when we got back together. It was like a slap in the face. I came back with a ""forget it, I'm seeing someone else"" story.And he really can't complain, after all he's married and he's the one that withheld the information of his wife'S pregnancy from me in the beginning.As I mentioned on the other thread, I finally did write to him and put my pride aside to tell him how much I had felt for him and I told him the truth, I told him how I felt like he'd punched me in the face when he told me about his wife. Especially considering he told me in such a careless way.And yet before then, I had backed off..because I knew I was in love and I felt the danger. When I backed off, his pride got hurt and maybe, maybe he got hurt too.It took me really humbling myself to write him that letter and he has not responded. So today, I made one last peace offering before I go.I have received Hex 13,5 about him (us) twice and although it is encouraging..the second time I got it was today as part of a reading that gave me Hex 13.3.5line three is very accurate.I have had moments of heartache over him and moments in which I declared that I ""hate the bastard"" to my friends (of course, I don't really..I think everyone can relate to the process of grieving over someone)Because I have tried. I'Ve been so sincere and opened my heart.I asked the IC how that last message would affect his attitude towards us and it answered hex 19.1.3 ApproachAnd finally (sorry Hilary I just couldnt resist) I asked in dispair""oh HOW does he feel about me?""and sadly I got55.2.3 leadin to Hex 54 (again, how accurate!)How heart breaking. He hates me? How could he? I've not lied to him or yelled at him or threatened him..The tone of my letters was not accusatory, I went to great lengths to try to express my hurt with kindess.Excuse my language but I feel like s**t. I want so much just to have a sincere conversation with him and be able to move on. But he refuses to respond. He's not the one that's been wronged..it's like he's pouring salt in the wound by refusing to respond.I wish I could ball my eyes out and just get it all out.I just asked, from a very emotional place.. i don't think I have ever been so emotionally raw when talking with the IC, ""will he finally respond?""and it answered Hex 43 Breakthough, unchanging. let this be what i hope it could mean-Last edited: Dec 6, 2007"

For example, I recently received Hexagram 54 (in answer to a relationship question) with changing lines 5 and 6. This is the second time I have received this.

I’ve forayed into Runes as well, but always seem to be drawn back to the Yi.

I’m trying to move on emotionally from the most powerful relationship of my life. We are physically separated by a significant distance, and they want to maintain a platonic friendship. Though I would never turn my back on this person, my attachment to them is so strong that I feel I need to move on completely in order to be open to new possibilities. My most recent contact with them was an email exchange over the past holidays that had me consulting the Changes perhaps twenty times (!).They commented about missing me and wishing we could get together in these emails, comments I initially ignored. I began to feel very unhappy about ignoring these comments, so I asked the Yi what thoughts it had about my apologizing for ignoring their comments and acknowledging that I felt the same. I received 61.2 > 42I sent the apology, and asked several other questions over the next few days, which together seemed to confirm that my decision to move on was fundamentally correct, the last question appeared to be answered quite clearly (56.5 > 33).I felt a measure of peace about this, thanked the Yi, and then asked if it had any final thoughts.I again received 61.2 > 42 (!)I received an acknowledgment of my apology shortly thereafter, and after a few more consultations with the Changes, sent a brief response myself. I then asked:“I may never be able to release the hope, but I’ve done what I can, said what I needed to, and haven’t betrayed my feelings. The will of heaven will be correct, regardless of the outcome. Is there anything you want to add?”The response was 25.3 > 13How might this all be interpreted objectively, by an outsider looking in? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Sorry that this is so lengthy."
3999,"I'm on a two-month stay living with my parents as I work from home at my office job. This is a temporary situation; i haven't lived with them (for more than a two-week stay) in more than 16 years.My mother has always had controlling tendencies but my stay has been OK so far until tonight. She sat me down to have a conversation about some intimate details of my life that I do not discuss with her and that IMHO are none of her business -- not as a mother. There are certain things I just do not and cannot share with her and these are top of the list. Partly bc growing up these things were never discussed. In actuality there is much about my life she doesn't know and that is fine by me bc she knows more than most parents do.However in our ""discussion""(in which she attacked me and accused me of not wanting to discuss it) she blew up and brought up issues from 16 years ago. I had been dreading this before I came for the visit bc i never know what lies temporarily dormant beneath the surface. Her attacks leave me feeling the need to hermit and isolate myself and be entirely alone. I attempted to level-headedly explain my point of view but despite her verbal desire to ""talk""she would not listen to what I said (or believe what I said).I asked the Yi what is going on with her. It gave me 1.1.2.3 and Hex 12 (stagnation).I gather that means (line 1) it is not time to act (for her??); (line2) Truth spoken at the incorrect time becomes untruth, correct action prematurily undertaken can create pain and heartache. (which she did) and (line 3) the situation is dangerous although you hold no fault in your approach (either her approach was faultless, or mine was; not sure which).I followed up with a question about who is to blame (because maybe I am interpreting this all wrong and she is totally right in her approach or right in her ideas and I am totally wrong). It gave me Hex58.2.4 and then Hex. 3, difficulty at the beginning. Those details of Hex 58 and 3 are:58. The Joyous. Success. Perseverance is favorable.The Image: Lakes resting on one another: The image of the Joyous. Thus the superior man joins with his friends For discussion and practice.line 2: Sincere joyousness. Good fortune. Remorse disappears.line 4: Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace. After ridding himself of mistakes a man has joy.Hex 3. Difficulty at the BeginningsDifficulty at the Beginning works supreme success,Furthering through perseverance.Nothing should be undertaken.It furthers one to appoint helpers.The ImageClouds and thunder:The image of Difficulty at the Beginning.Thus the superior manBrings order out of confusion.I""d like to know if there is another way I should approach this. Or if i'm right in my assumptions, approach, and reactions."
